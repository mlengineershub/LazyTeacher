you think that aliens are real some people and they think that they created the face mars some other people think that was made naturally winds people think that aliens made but the people nasa wasnt trying find aliens and they didnt the face mars was just common mesa that found that region the first thing that seen was viking was trying find landing place for its sister ship viking people only think was face because the tech wasnt advanced enough see the image clearly some people think that looked like egyptian pharaoh the face mars was some movies magicians and the radio some conspiracy theorists think that nasa found aliens and are hiding from the public more than one spacecraft was sent take pictures the land formation when they sent space crafts there the land formation was hidden clouds that made people crazy they started make storys about the clouds the space crafts where built only take pictures couple meters took them long time get the pictures finally they put rest when the last ship went there get pictures and they did that showed rock formation therefore many people where fighting about who was right about the mesa some people was arguing with nasa nasa said that the have buisness finding aliens people think that they are lying about the whole thing while others think that all true what they are saying they had prove that wasnt true they kept taking epicures untill they had clear epicure and they released the world,2
the face mars was not created aliens just happens natural landform that resembles human face although has human features like the head eyes nose and mouth actually shadows that give that illusion the fact that resembles human head coincidence you use new high resolution images and altimetry you could see for what really addition has starred hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows and haunted grocery store checkout line for years the fact that has become pop icon proves that many people have believed that the face was concrete evidence that life had have existed mars some people even believe that there evidence nasa would rather hide like conspiracy theorists but meanwhile this all happening defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars which further proves that there ancient civilization mars furthermore micheal malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos but when appeared jpl website revealed only natural landform this helps prove that there never was alien monument the first place although not everybody was satisfied with this fact they thought that perhaps that alien markings were hidden the wispy clouds malin team second look they captured extraordinary photo but what the picture actually showed was the martian equivalent mesa the end there was ancient civilization mars ancient monument and the face turned out only mesa although many people still argue about life mars there isn enough research for proven true otherwise the fact that the face was mistaken was because people couldn see for what truly was the photo,4

nowadays technology and science became one important parts human life makes life runs easier with human intelligent technology improved day day many things are discovered invented that don even know about their appearances one them the facial action coding system also known facs which technology could identify human emotions was created paul eckman opinion think this techonology useful especially order read the emotional expressions students classroom life contains many differences includes positive and negative things truthful untruthful some people said emotions are never lie could figure out the statue someone looking their face and that true however life something really complicated sometimes things front you don mean like what you think likewise even though the expression from people face the most authentic when they are trying hide their feelings literally can not know their real emotions the changing teenager issue that causes headache for parents their characters aren the same like before their emotions are changed both them could not find the common speech and push them further each other that the moment the childrens easily fall the darkness for real instance children students aren agree about their parent thinking the education from school completely most them don say out talk back really affects about effective studying and their plans the future the creation facs way solve this problem could read student thinking from that parents and teachers could understand about expected their kids their students therefore they could modify their ideas lessons able suitable leads success learning teachers and students could make kids and parents get closer and decrease the bad things happen the use the technology can read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable helps understand students feelings reactions about the lessons thus the teachers can recognize what are things helpful and unhelpful from that the effective studying will increased besides that also brings advantages communication between parents and child the adults could realize their kids are struggling with something not then they could find the ways share help order not let anything bad could occur having negative thinking and lead suicide,3
who says that driverless cars will make our future better the ones who want destroy against driverless cars for three reasons could result global warming will cost alot money and could hazardous the safety all organisms this belief because feel that these cars will make the world fall apart even faster first driverless cars can result global warming able build these cars the humans will build multiple factories make the parts they will release new unknown toxins into the air that can possibly untreatable also they will take alot new land and destroy forests and our oxygen supply second will cost alot money money crucial this world would cost millions close billions try find parts that would needed construct the vehicles then out and try hire people make these cars also these vehicles are actually made will cost all the people who would die have these cars pay thousands finally the safety all organisms who say that these vehicles wont malfunction already forbidden california nevada florida and the district columbia test drive these cars due the fact that unknown whether safe not someone gets into wreck this supposedly safe vehicle which will the one blame the manufacturer the driver this backfires there will lawsuits fighting and violence conclusion all signs really point the opinion that the driverless car bad idea believed make our even more dark and dangerous then could possibly driverless cars could our worlds undoing could cause global warming and flood our earth could cost lot money making millions people bankrupt and lastly could deadly all life the planet,4
the article making mona lisa smile the author explains how new technology called the facial action coding system enables computes know human sad happy confused angry fearful disgusted also the author describes how this would help teacher their classes identify students are bored tired making easier for teachers find another way get students attention opinion this would good idea for schools use and make more efficient way teaching students and teachers differents ways teach and learn making more fun and less trending for everyone although this may expensive and students will not like computer read their emotions because would weird for them and also may uncontrolled for students having computer just say their feelings front class the facial action coding system facs great idea for schools said earlier but not see how could help other things the article describes how this new technology can identify human emotions but does not explains how would work society will help people understand one another better the facs can tell your emotions the way the muscles the face move making easier for the computer identify what emotion the human felling they use video imagery create new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements also the new technology can identify mixed emotions the article also describes how making expression can make you feel slighty the expression that was just used according facial feedback theory emotion moving facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them this may happen because unconsciously imitate another person facial expressions conclusion this article demonstrates you how can new technology can hal you understand other peoples emotions even they are trying hide them also helps people understand how they are really feeling and how does emotions work when express them,2
the article driverless cars are coming negative aspect the future negative aspect because driverless cars are invented that can cause more accidents and more people will think that texting okay because these new cares are being invented and they will not have charge anything the future with transportation system would change the world into worse place position driverless cars that will help some that can not drive good others but the ones who will always count their car now for anything will not know what something were happen suddenly when this car alerts you accident ahead you getting through traffic the people will have idea what because they will rely this driverless car get them through manufacturers are also considering using cameras watch the drivers are remaining focused the road what this quote trying illustrate that the manufacturers would put cameras into the cars test and see the driver still paying attention the road even though driverless car becasue driverless car they will distracted something there cellular device also driverless cars more dangerous than person driving itself because what something where happen this car the system stopped working and the person that was not paying attention caused huge accident position driverless cars that still isn driverless because you would still have alert take over the article driverless cars are coming dangerous invention that the manufacturers are coming with because they think that this world would better but other people might think the opposite,3
the article making mona lisa smile the author explains this new technology and describes how works the technology would have many benefits which include students focusing more getting more involved and even doing better school the new technology can have major advantages for not only the students but the administration well using the facial action coding system the students will tend more focused something that catches their eye the new technology can tell when one getting more distracted can change lesson plan classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored the lesson can changed into something not only beneficial but entertaining for the students holding the attention every student hard task for one teacher with this new system can help hold the attention even when the teacher has attention some students some dont focus the same situation holding the attention major factor school setting and with the help the sytem learning can change every student has different learning style can also help how much the students interact the students will learn their pace with their required style teaching the new sytem will provide them therefore leading better understanding the task hand the students will start participating more abd ecn start sharing their thoughts the siletz plus the new exciting way learning will make them want show how mch they learned with the new facial action coding system lastly the students are focusing more their new and improved learning techniques then they will also get more their homework done the new technology will hold the attention the audience and teach the topic better this system will help the teachers get every childs attention rather than some every teacher teacher her pace her technique they think best for but sometimes their way not the right way for every student the new facial action coding system has many advantages that school administration should take into consideration will help kids leron feel proud enough interact and even give them boost confidence get better grades,3

cars most people use them for transportation our lazy way getting places automobiles benefit plenty when comes getting from point point but they also have big negative impact cars are responsible for huge amount pollution like greenhouse gas emissions and smog were limit car usage could decrease the amount stress and pollution emitted into the air well give our community chance improve vauban germany residents have given their cars and have problem doing cars are generally not allowed forbidden some would say this district vauban streets are pretty much car free course car ownership still allowed with the acceptation that you have able find place park since there are only two places large garages the end the development where car owner can buy space for along with home when had car was always tense much happier this way heidrun walter stated mother two experts say automobiles are huge impediment current efforts drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmissions from tailpipes europe passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emmissions and percent some car intensive areas the united states paris participated driving ban which violators suffered fine euro paris typically has more smog than other european capitals for example last week paris had micrograms particulate matter per cubic meter while brussels had and london since paris participated this ban percent paris smog has cleared bogota columbia the city held car free day leaving the streets eerily devoid traffic jams was the third year row cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted this day without cars their goal promote alternative transportation and reduce smog well violators here faced fines even with occasional bad weather people still participated this event good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution said carlos arturo plaza business man rode two seated bicycle with his wife the day without cars allowed parks and sports centers bloom uneven sidewalks replaced wih broad smooth sidewalks new restaurants and upscale shopping districts crop and rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic the united states americans are starting buy fewer cars drive less and get fewer licenses each year passes partially because cash strapped americans couldn afford new cars this pattern continues which many sociologists believe will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment even though reducing automobile transportation could have negative implications for car industries the positive affects are much more important this generation the internet allows people connect without having drive meet friends the mobile world congress last year barcelona spain bill ford executive chairman the ford motor company laid out business plan for world which personal vehicle ownership impractical undesirable ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry create cities which pedestrian bicycle private cars commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety conclusion cars are starting less and less necessity and more and more people are starting notice that automobiles are just hurting the environment limiting car use can limit stress help the environment well communities improve save time conserve resources and improve safety there are plenty other ways get transportation that are less damaging and dangerous like bicycles and walking course may take little longer get places without car but you can always ride bus enjoy the scenery while riding bike walking,4
the idea driverless cars astounding the thought people longer needing buy cars wonderful would cut down pollution and deaths injuries caused automobile accidents the use autonomous cars will decrease the amount pollution the atmosphere the amount pollution will cut down simply cutting down the amount cars one proposal for this using autonomous cars type taxi system the text states google cofounder sergey brin can envisions future with public transport system where fleets autonomous cars form public transport taxi system this shows that some the worlds leading investors are looking making public transport only driverless cars possible another way would cut down pollution would the amount fuel consumption driverless cars are predicted need half much fuel conventional cars the text illustrates the cars forsees would use half the fuel todays taxis and offer more flexibility than bus this means that driverless cars when used taxi like situation would more fuel efficient and more practical than todays public transport system another way autonomous cars would beneficial the safety they provide computers are more alert than humans and are always doing their job this would mean that the numbed rof deaths and injuries because car accidents would decrease the text states bmw announced the developement traffic jam assistant the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure that the driver keeps hold the wheel this shows that even though the car doing majority the driving such controlling speed and direction the driver must remain alert while the car case emergencies another way that autonomous cars make driving safer onboard alerts the car watches the road for hazards and finds one alerts the driver the text illustrates while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver this shows hta even though the driver may focused the road the car focused making sure the driver driving safely both these advances will greatly change the way drive they will also help our everyday lives and make life more enjoyable,4
the use this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom would somehow valuable depends who getting benefit from and how the person who being reading its expressions would feel but personal opinion not find any value classroom can imagine this system classroom would not behave freely and think classmates would too when are the classroom some are there learn and admit that sometimes not understand not even bit the teaching lesson and this system would benefit because the teacher will know need more clarified when this technology tell him how feel about the subject but what not have our mind the classroom and would like some privacy course will not have and everyone will know our deepest feelings all deserve privacy and not for only our own good have some doubts and need help would ask the teacher some not and might for reason just have another source information like independent would have argue where this system would more valuable will not say some where everyone free express not express themselves think that any reasonable not reasonable person will agree with the use this technology valuable depending its purpose and find some advantages when need help and not know how ask for and disadvantages are not sure really want and our own job resolve our problems there always pros and cons when school college learning are still developing skills and reach them have work for ourselves have independent and find our pathways and with this conclude that the use this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom not necessary not valuable,3
driving cars manually thing the past some people think and hope the new topic having driverless cars might the next big thing there are some people out there that think that having these cars might unsafe for people and the result that illegal test and drive computer driven cars some states believe that having these types car will great for our future think that having cars that are driverless would great thing people saying that these cars are very unsafe and banning them from different states nonsense the passage says fact none these cars developed far are completely driverless they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills this tells the reader that they are still manuale the driver the car just can some the easy things but can tough things like driving through work zones and around accidents there are some concerns about the car that would most definately needed worked and studied make sure the car safer and better for the people major problem that this car would have would getting into accidents the passage talks about the accidents and says the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer this very big problem because right now one knows who fault would the driver was sitting back and letting the car drive its self and its crashes into another car object who fault this major concern for lot people and the people making these cars however can solved lots studying and testing for the cars this why that having these cars that are driverless would great idea conclusion having driverless cars might seem crazy some people and seem like there way would happen lots studding and testing have gone into this idea because some people want dream become reality these driverless cars are big concerns but the long run might safer people then just normal cars having driverless cars would very good for have the future,3
should driverless cars allowed should people rely technology for something important transportation stated paragraph one such cars could fundamentally change the world says google cofounder sergey brin right these driverless cars will fundamentally change the world but that really the kind change people want not everything should taken over technology sixteen year olds across america get the privilege drive just get taken away because nowadays the car can drive for you keep mind there can many problems with these cars one such problem that can accu system failure these cars are engineered stop when they sense something that too close from the rear and the front are these sensors completely reliable for example the sensor stops working and the car gets into accident stated paragraph nine that creates problem with manufacturers just imagine the problem that the manufacturing business would face because unreliable technology used the vehicle how will these vehicles react weather conditions snow rain and even warm weather macbooks can left out the snow without technology damage what make buyers think that these such vehicles can drive safely cold wet conditions paragraph four talks about all the sensors these automobiles what happens them freezing out gets wet sure manufacturers can put some kind protection keep from getting wet but one say one hundred percent safe paragraph eight starts saying this why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver driverless cars today are not one hundred percent driverless maybe instead making cars driverless maybe they should made more safe for driving these driverless cars still need driver anyways all that really happening right now these cars are being made more efficient maybe instead taking all the driving privilege away instead make easier for people have that privilege safely should driverless cars allowed and are they one hundred pecent safe personally think not recently stated driving privilege and this world things should not done for technology fundamentally changing the world also taking over completely safety unreliable technology and manufacturers are big reasons disagree with driverless cars leave the driving the people just make more safe,4

aliens knowledge twenty five years before nasa viking spacecraft spotted landform the shape face mars surface this after being released the media caused uprising speculations did aliens make this were there other beings other planets are not alone famous scientist once said that researched for other life other planets because humans didn want alone this vast galaxy also said that could cause either fear excitement the media wanted grab the attention the common people and that they needed something extraordinary the media spins the truth benefit their needs you can believe everything they say because all they can gain your speculation nasa hardly thought this was the work aliens they didn want the people think they were lying they wanted seek the truth even they were hiding something they could only ever lose everything for covering more attention the dying out nasa program would gain the support and money fund them april they sent another spacecraft take pictures the landform not everyone thought the image that came the one landform sufficed they argued that was probably too hazy and that the image wasn reliable resource they said that the haze was blocking the alien markings again nasa sent another spacecraft take better pictures different angles the picture showed landform much like butte mesa here earth some people stated that was conspiracy mars has unique quirks like every planet here earth have natural landforms such mesa and mountains and rivers mars isn much different scientists have special categories for classifying planet and pluto did not meet those requirements every planet has have least one thing common with another just because mars different planet doesn mean that can have landforms much like those earth say that one planet has aliens because landform say that are aliens well don have mountains yes you might say but because tectonic plates pushing against each other science has taught many things now know something foreign people back then take christopher columbus example before sailed the ocean everyone thought that the earth was flat after disproved the theory people saw the earth for what was round water planet another great example would galileo who disproved the theory that earth was the center the galaxy and the sun and everything else rotated around people had have curiosity and the willpower with these expeditions after they disproved theory made more sense and the world around just now don question how the mountains were made don question why have day and night are more educated now but there are still things haven learned that why people should have more open mind about finding the truth once find the truth move bigger things and and this mystery one which piques people interest but turning myth and false facts isn the way exploring and learning from new innovations what makes scientists who they are they took the time through the process being certified scientist say you are smarter than one disrespectful towards them saying all their hard work was worth nothing summarize aliens did not make the landform mars was natural occurence that got blown into bigger proportions because the media wanted satisfy their own needs get profit nasa knows what they are saying and should respect their statements until for sure know ourselves that the statement false,5
the author suggests that studying venus important for few reasons the first which that venus one the most earth like planets our solar system the second one venus could have once been able compatible for life another thing that the author brings that venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes the final reason that the author brings the challenges that nasa facing trying get venus what the author getting that when finally figure out how get venus this could help get other planets well that why think that the author wants study venus the first which that the author brings the fact that venus the most earth like planet our solar system venus has rocky surface similar that earth also has valleys mountain and craters all this similar that earth and can used maybe help more understand out planet another thing that the author brings that venus similar earth that scientist believe that venus was once covered largely with oceans this means that their could have been life venus such plants another thing that was brought was paragraph three where the author talked about how venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes this something that also share with that also happening here earth could venus and study all that could help understand how know farther ahead time when may have earthquake the final thing that the author talks about all the challenges that will face trying get humans the ground venus the troubles that face the atmosphere and the pressure these challenges make almost impossible for humans withstand because the pressure times greater than what experience here earth what the author getting that are able get through all these challenges and get boots the ground venus would mean that when are explore study another planet can overcome these challenges much faster that why think that the author wants explore venus the first reason being venus one the most earth like planets our solar system the second one being that venus was once able compatible for life third that venus experiences earthquakes and lightning strikes just like earth does finally the last thing that the author brings that going venus could help travel other planets with knowledge how can overcome the challenges from venus that why think that the author wants nasa study venus farther and learn more about,4
dear state senator agreeing favor keeping the electoral college there need change election popular vote for the president the united states that because the house representatives helps elect for helps balance our votes and avoid problems election the electoral college helps the people out alot with the voting situation and helps better understand and know our new president the broader significance the electoral college that the house representatives helps vote for our new president source one paragraph three says your state entitled allotment electors equal the number members its congressional delegation one for each number the house representatives plus two for your senators that tells that the people are not alone this process voting who will our next president also the same source but paragraph five states the electors are generally chosen the candidate political party this informs that not only the house representatives involved the elections tthe govenment important the electoral college because the votes the government count most the college evident that the electoral college helps balance our votes stated source three the electoral college restores some the weight the political balance that large states population lose virtue the mal apportionment the senate decreed the constitution this lets know that the people won have worry much about the voting and selection the president another peirce evidence stated the same source and paragraph other things being equal large state gets more attention from presidential candidates campaign than small state does that states that not all people and states have worry about who the president will the electoral college khels out alot mostly the big states the united states above all the electoral college avoid problems the elections source three paragraph twenty two states the electoral college avoids problems the elections which candidate recieve majority the votes cast this lets know that the electoral college doing good job keeping the votes clean and simple understand also stated the same source and paragraph there pressure for run off elections when candidate wins majority the votes cast that pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process reduced the electoral college which invariably produces clear winner that tells that the electoral college keeping the votes point there are some people out there who don agree with the electoral college and dont like the way the votes are being put because sometimes the president that they chose wasn elected they are wrong disagree with the electoral college because the college keeps everything going order and clear path let know who our president will stated source two paragraph ten under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for the slate electors who tur elect the president this makes them disagree because they think that the electoral college doesn vote for their president but they shouldn worry because they way they vote how many states helped the electors vote for that presient being chosen the president also source two the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states that makes some people disagree also but the electoral college doesn count how many people each big small state voted for president all the college does help the government elect for the president that they most support and elect for agree that the electoral college should kept favor because all the help that gives and the government also the college helps stay balanced the votes that nothing gets misplaced misunderstood most all avoids problems during the election that the people and the government are satisfied with their votes the elektrostal college great way keep things going clear election the year the electoral college doesn need any changes for because even they chose the elections the government the votes the people still count them well the votes the popel are important the electoral college just much the government votes are,5
what the author was suggesting when was saying venus dangerous but worthy pursuit was that spacecraft survived more that couple hours venus the atmosphere was dangerous people has the hottest surface temperature the first reason you cant onto venus because spacecraft lasted more than couple hours venus spacecraft couldn survive venus there way that human can survive the second reason that man can not venus because the atmosphere dangerous humans the atmosphere almost percent cardon dioxide which deadly humans its like being trapped small airtight box with holes the last reason that humans can venus because also has the hottest surface temperature all the planets while also having many active volcanoes earthquakes and more frequent lightning strikes conclusion human can last very long venus making interesting but hard research that spacecraft survived more that couple hours venus the atmosphere dangerous people has the hottest surface temperature,2
electoral college should changed election popular vote for the president because electoral college electors tried changing votes favor the opponent because sometimes they weren located where they wanted passage defense the electoral college states that the electoral college non democratic method selecting president that ought overruled declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner passage the indefensible electoral college says under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate the president electoral college should replaced withe the election popular vote for the president because electoral college causing much crisis for example source the indefensible electoral college says that you lived texas and you wanted vote for john kerry you vote for slate democratic electors pledged kerry even though you are not voting for electors just for john kerry electoral college makes you forces you things you arent aware electoral college replaced with the vote the president find pretty fair because dont think the president the united states going cheat the election the electors every vote should fair since electors can anyone the electoral college process seems unfair source says that the best argument against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor people should fair when voting,2

run our elections process called electoral college this process consists tje selection the electors the meeting the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting the electoral votes congress the electoral college consists electors majority electoral votes required elect the president there also another process which the election popular vote for the president the united states could change popular vote but why would change how run the election this how have been doing for years also there are many other reasons why should keep the electoral college such certainty outcome everyone president swing states big states and also avoid run off elections dispute over the outcome electoral college vote possible but less likely than dispute over the popular vote the reason that the winning candidates share the electoral college invariably exceeds his share the popular vote tie the nationwide electoral vote possible because the total number votes even number but highley unlikely also the electoral college requires presidential candidate have trans regional appeal region has enough electoral votes elect president the electoral college restores some the weight the politial balance that large states population lose virtue the mal apportionment the senate decreed the constitution the winner take all method awarding electoral votes induces the candidates voters toss states are more likely pay more attention the campaign really listen the competing candidates knowing jat they are going decide the election they are likely the most thoughtful voters can argued that the president may turn off potential voters for canidate who has hope carrying their state believe that should not change our electoral process popular vote and think should stick with the process have now electoral college listed resona why but the main reason that everyone used the electoral college process because have been doing for years change might confuse everyone and actual make the elections even more difficult and might end messing our election and cause unfair vote,4
driving one the most dangerous everyday things that and dont need computers help make anymore dangerous this article they bring the possibility having hands free driving this subject that has been tested and fantasized humans for quite awhile now google has had this technology since around and has allowed them test however these tests the cars have not been truely fully automated computer there has been driver behind the seat everytime the tests that have taken place have proven that the computers have the capability driving under the circumstances that they were presented with but they still require the driver alert whats the point the time that the car has spent driving still required the driver remain alert behind the wheel once ran into issues belive that this just tool that asking for trouble most people dont have trouble driving themselves and this tool just another peirce technology that going make more lazy feel like there are far more chances for the computers calculate wrong malfunction and possibly hard kill the passengers and drivers behind the wheel well others the road feel like people might also misinformed this was ever released into the public and feel like the computer doing all the work but right now thats not the case this can multifamily lead more accidents and deaths behind the wheel the article states this were happen who really blame the driver the manufacturer this leads more issues than conveniences opinion and could far more damage large companies that would relapsing this hardware into the world there would need total redesign safety laws and additions the laws that are already place conclusion dont feel like cars need autopilot feature because has more cons than pros this point and danger the public until tested for longer period not against the future possibly but this point time its far too dangerous and adds the chaos that already place the roads hopefully the time that tesla releases their vehicle they have done enough testing make sure that its safe possible,3
human emotion can expressed many things such body language tone and language emotion allows understand others and empathize easier software known facial action coding system has been developed improve accuracy calculating the emotions others using this technology read emotional expressions students classroom invaluable because humans already can calculate emotions the classroom not taught computer and human emotions are very complex the first reason that the facs invaluable the classroom because there need use technology calculate emotions student classroom consists teacher and several students which are humans the author stated within the article humans perform this same impressive calculation every day further states that can probably tell how friend feels just the look their face since humans can already perceive and understand emotions others there need for mode technology figure out when someone bored confused about certain subjects classroom when student bored confused about certain subject she could simply ask for help from teacher peer using the facs technology would redundant reading emotional expressions students therefore invaluable technology computers are not what teach students classroom the author tells the reader imagine classroom computer that could recognize your emotions could modify the lesson like effective human instructor there always human instructor the teacher classroom there should not need for modification lesson computer when the teacher can modify the lesson students not need dependent computer learn what they need learn classroom and computer that can calculate emotion obsolete its uselessness the manner learning the final reason why emotion calculating technology invaluable classroom that emotion too complex for just classroom computer calculate first all emotion differs from person person the maricle huang professor the university amsterdam said the facial expression for each emotion are universal but also stated individuals often show varying degrees expression emotional expressions are all unique would very difficult for computers calculate the exact feeling students feeling just their facial expression also the seventh paragraph the author stated your home can handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile this means that the classroom computer would not able calculate like how was used the article conclusion the facs too redundant and under developed any use for classroom enviroment invaluable and there are multiple substitutes that can read emotional expressions students school the future with further innovations there will time where classrooms use this type technology enhance education but right now the system not useful for helping classrooms teach students,5

the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the author does mention thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus there are many challenge studying venus the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit the author mentions challenges that face order study venus the author states striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors while they are many challenges that scientists and that people may face venus worthy being studied nasa possible solution thhe hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray they are many ways venus can studied with nasa solution are closer discovering the many secrets venus our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,2
how would you like walking the sidewalk and see nothing but automatic driverless cars this equable and according scientists may the case scientist have long been working cars that drive themself however fascinating this idea may sound the negative aspects this far otway the positives for example the cost the new smartcards roads will almost unbearable for the average middle class family the cars will have have bunch sensors from rotating roof sensor camera sensor that watches you the car drives the text states smart road sytems worked surprisingly well but they required massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply expensive practical however the cost the new cars not the only setback why not spend time and money researching something more important having fully autonomous car may nice but isnt necessity why not cure cancer the common cold alot cure research facilities lack the funding and staff that they need succesfully find cure however more effort and funding was put towards them instead autonomous cars would help substantially lastly what would happen the car malfunctions and the driver wasn able control the car could travel the road and hit innocent bystanders could also hit other cars and cause expensive dangerous and perhaps unviable crash automatons cars could vary dangerous and this case having car that drives itself isn such good idea the idea automatons cars arent bad but their just impractical automatons cars are vary expensive they also contain alot loads underlying safety hazards these are the reasons that believe that the negatives automatons cars strongly outweigh the positives,3
technogym everywhere its our coffie maker your house your car the way work your phone calling tell your boss you are stuck traffic and the computer your work place but some one decided make technogym even better man the name prof thomas huang the brillant facial action coding system will able change verity industries how angry would people students would sitting school taking test doing assignment and they were getting upset because they not understand the assignment now dont need get upset anymore because the facial action coding software can detect these kind emotions classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored predicts huang then the software could alter the question need the student can understand the computerized assignment this would extremly useful for people who find challenge understand tough questions most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication notes chaung computers need understand that this very important because people can not always tell person smiling becuase they are happy they are tring cover what they are truly feeling classroom students are not likley talk about their feeling fear getting bullied and made fun the facial action coding software can calculate the emotions held kid and help treleaven the stress difficult test assignment with this being said kids can also manipulate the software acting sad angry try weaken the strength the computer based assignment this could lead helping develop deceptive attitude young students that could continue worsen time goes would rather choose help the students who really need additional guidance classroom get the help that they need not introduce this brillant program countless students because the fear kids putting their own future steak because they want take the easy road life the facial action coding software mind blowing program that will help kids and students all ages acheive what they did not think would possible with being able detect sad confused face student will help the facs program understand the emotions that kid aslo being able change for any kids need not something that teacher can very easily this would help the teacher able give support the kids with out being their next them all the time the facial action coding system will help many kids well teacher all across the world are willing jump into the future schooling and take couple risks,3

the face mars natural landform only coincidence that looks like face people want believe that there life mars but they not have the scientific evidence that they would need prove this first all the cameras that are used are the best they can possibly make they even used the maximum resolution the camera can produce can even see there were small objects near the face they used those cameras and they didn see anything that proved life like people are denial they want believe that there life another planet the media doesn help with this issue either this idea alien monument everywhere the media and some actually believe real this face just being used entertainment value and huge money maker for movie producers hollywood there are facts that prove there are aliens mars but some people are too stubborn listen what nasa has say they would rather believe hollywood other unreliable sources with facts the united states america proof enough that this face fact landform natural things like this occur all the time the american west have all kinds oddly shaped landforms that know came naturally this case with mars seems different than what happens earth conspiracy theorists believe that nasa hiding alien evidence from the public but the photos were released and plain see that there alien activity happening the face mars just regular mesa that normal people earth only looks like face because there are certain shadows that can trick into thinking that facial features were intentionally added although pretty incredible nothing more than just natural landform unfortunate that was just false alarm according scientists but time face the facts,3

the author said that worthy pursuit despite the danger presents paragraph stares that each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hour that paragraph sates that most important that reseachers can take sample rocks gas anything else from distance that scientists are trying seek something that would get close and personal despite the risk paragraph also states that many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus also paragraph its states that comparison systems that use mechanical parts can made more resistant pressure heat and other forces conclusion that passable studying venus use technology that can stand venus risk and there are way for scientists get close venus use types machine,2
dear state senator disagree with the electoral college and believe the voters should sourly responsible for determining our president the electoral college not fair the citizens our state when vote for something want our vote determine our president not determine who our electors will vote for when member their party votes they may not always vote for that particular party candidate for instance the democratic elect for had aspect planned bring washington that member the democratic party didn agree with they should able vote for whoever they please same goes for the electors who may swing the opposite party that particular year the case tie however agree that should then state senators take into consideration both candidates and over their key aspects then they can choice what will most beneficial our country and what will the long run help our great state and country well not think their should swing states think that the exact votes the citizens should counted and only that should not matter the state region the voter instead voters submitting ballot the local voting site think the voter should able vote online local voting center the past voting has got miss counted and think that more accurate means voting would online that way papers can not get lost and computer can count vote human error does not occur also highly agree with the statement from paragraph that states can argued that the electoral college method selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has hope carrying their state this true with states particularly the north who are made mostly democratic and the south being mainly republican after the decisions made the current president obama think many democratics will want try something different after seeing all that has not been accomplished under obama hope senator you will take into consideration statement best regards hannah strickland,3
the article driverless cars are coming the author presents many positive aspects driverless cars that should noticed the pros greatly otway the cons the argument whether driverless cars are beneficial not every con that was mentioned the article was over the topics laws liability and how driverless the cars really were these arguments are extremely miniscule when placed next the big picture throughout the article the author points out the most important fact driverless cars they are safer option driving world where accidents happen all the time our job lessen the frequency these accidents paragraph the author expresses that cars that were developed google were able drive for more than half million miles without crash which groundbreaking this innovation makes that people are just slightly more safe and protected then should used businesses and companies have already been putting time and money into these feats automation there harm them finishing their work paragraph said that many companies have already predicted when they will able distribute driverless cars let promote these companies and their word there are consequences developing these technologies only consequences not doing anything would shame see something that could benefit every single person and their safety waste not sought out anyone that cares about the safety themsleves and others should want this innovation implemented into society there nothing the world that should more important good parent than the safety their child,3

driverless cars are theory good idea but when put the test with real humans inside them they are far too dangerous and not practical with one driving the car only relying seniors there way too many possiblities injury wether the riders pedestrians the smart cars would too expensive for the average american and just not realistic the article driverless cars are coming states that google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since what are the specific conditions certainly not hard rain heavy snowfall real life situations one watching the road huge risk anything could happen that senor could not detect people should not trust senor carry their family their destination wether ten mintues away hour who would fault accident driverless car hit another cart that did have driver with driverless car the driver would get bored doze off spend time his her cell phone with distracted driver the likelihood accident increases dramatically the driver presuming that accidents will occur would look away from the road but when car pulls out unexpectedly infront whose fault would the manufacturer the driver the driverless car the driver car puting ones self ones family that kinda danger really testing their luck smart cars that can drive themselves would extremly expensive brands like mercedes benz audi and nissan are already the hundred thousand dollar range car like not practical the everyday person those who ride driverless car are put more danger than those who ride along with driver driverless cars are likely cause more accident especially because the car not seeing what going infront the car will not able notice black ice heavily trafficked area road construction know exactly when use the brake accident were occur infront these types cars are way too expensive not realistic and not safe they seem,3
gerald was one the scientists that led the investigation the face had been college already has been very experienced with these types scenarios used nasa viking and saw object that appeared face got closer look later his career and was not actual face this was later taken surprise the general public and they still thought that had real sign life mars because this research believe that the face just natural landform three reasons why believe this true are that nasa research has proven this photographs taken nasa have shown that this true and comparisons landforms earth have shown the public that this the truth first reason for stating opinion would that nasa research has proven that the face landform example this from the text would that nasa has published many photos the face show the public that was just landform further explain this you look close enough the pictures this passage then you can see landform may look like face from far distance but evidence given nasa has shown that this not the case second reason for this the fact that nasa has taken many photographs this landform prove true here quote from the text that shows this and april when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos later this paragraph states that the picture has proven that there was not alien monument secondly people stated was cloudy day mars they were not satisfied with the picture april cloudless summer day cydonia mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look later the paragraph garvin expert that works with nasa says this malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution even though wasn cloudy the team nasa got the same result just landform last reason would that comparisons landforms earth have proven that this true garvin says paragraph twelve that reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars what this saying that there have been similar landforms earth that are mars scientists can use this data compare different pieces landforms different planets using this they can figure out what the face actually and other mysteries that they come against some people may have used say that the picture was too blurry make out what the face actually was however nasa has taken many clear photos the face and they have proven several times that not alien artifact and that only landform the surface the planet what you think now you still believe that the face ancient artifact well you should not anymore after reading this the evidence given here this essay clearly shows that the face just landform scientists like gerald and garvin have shown this repeated amount times conclusion believe that the face just natural landform and not proof life mars,5
can you imagine time the future where driverless cars exist such cars could fundamentally change the world from position don really think that they are good idea even though they can fascinating most states illegal test computer driven cars could dangerous and something could wrong not everybody approves driverless cars traffic laws would have change lot people would not happy traffic laws were changed just other people could have driverless cars there could alot accidents the traffic laws change the technology fails and someone injured whose fault the driver the manufacturer the manufacturers were blamed they could sewed and they could loose alot money the other hand the driver could get blamed without fault and that would not fair them you would not know who blame even though driverless cars can fascinating people they might not the greatest idea,2
google has had cars that can drive independently under specific conditions since google cofounder sergey brin envisions future with public transportation system where fleets driverless cars form public transport taxi system believe this would efficient use driverless cars and would large improvement our transportation system today driverless cars still need drivers managers control the car which would provide more jobs large cities driverless cars would able use half the fuel todays taxis while offering far more flexibility with carpooling bmw announced the development traffic jam assistant the car can handles driving functions speeds mph while touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel case complex driving issues collision near collision none the cars developed today are completely driverless they can basic driving functions such steering accelerating amd braking themselves but are designed notify the driver when she should take the wheel this means the human driver must remain alert case she should have take over could have large amounts cars cities like this would provide jobs for the managers the cars while amounting less accidents the road all the smart cars could interact and communicate each other alert managers accidents traffic problems ahead this technology could also used prevent more collisions google has had cars that can drive independently under specific conditions since google cofounder sergey brin envisions future with public transportation system where fleets driverless cars form public transport taxi system believe this would efficient use driverless cars and would large improvement our transportation system today driverless cars still need drivers managers control the car which would provide more jobs large cities driverless cars would able use half the fuel todays taxis while offering far more flexibility with carpooling,3

driverless cars have been imagined for many years they come close building but fails officialy called driverless cars google has tred but have only made where the car alerts driver close object theirs been other ways trying make driverless car but come out fails expansive like the smart road that has been tested and has had positive records but that would mean would have change all the roads and make knew ones that would take for ever and the money would spend that would leave our economy more dete then are the article said driverless cars were created the future how would that impact lifes and country well let tell you more saftey laws would have made like how would accounted for some one gets hurt because frailer the system would the owner the car the companys fault for the frailer their technology the article said that could cause major problems with what just mentioned that brings second question what something the car fails would that impact the inter car and cubase break down the artifical mentions the people trying creat the driverless car have been testing int with lot different technology said the artifical they been using sensors cameras and gps the cars but what one the cameras the sensors would fail their job while driving highway main road that would cubase worse accident then with someone driving conclusion would prefer driving have more liability know where going and know that the one driving ask you would you rather lay your life and family friends computer know that you can drive that option driverless cars,2

the face mars was not created aliens simply natural land form you can find similar land forms earth also why would nasa even want hide the existence aliens simply illogical think that was made aliens the face mars may look like mask face but that doesn prove that was made aliens there are many landforms here earth that look like faces animals nasa has taken photos and clearly just mesa why would nasa hide the existence aliens from anyways considering that has become pop icon and has starred hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for years wouldn nasa benefit from the existence aliens nasa has not covered the existence aliens the face mars just naturally occuring landform that happens look like face fun think about what would happen was actual face created aliens but was not made aliens anyways nasa would trying prove that there were are aliens there was actually made aliens they would benefit greatly aliens made the face,3

the article talked about trying travel venus would say best opinion one day will have the technology travel venus and stay their for then couple weeks and able learn more about earth sister planet what like lot about this article that makes sure talk about lot similarities has earth and well lot differences has earth well what found the most crazy about this was that robot anything sent venus could survive the harsh conditions for more then few hours when comes down the author you can tell heavily supports the thought traveling venus support also because never hurts learn new things about someone something but think the thing that stopping the cost that takes send something there and there point just send someone there die what like about this article that talks about lot things venus has common with earth and lot thing earth and venus have thats different then each other somethings earth and venus have common together they are both reflectivity the same and they are really close each other distance but some differences are earth ble top have life and venus not because the heat pressure and the chemicals the air inspite the want travel venus and figure out seems highly unlikely because how dangerous the planet actually while traveling venus sounds like really cool sometime down the future right now and know don have the money support trip that far away even its supposed close one the main reasons think scientists want travel venus bad because they always trying learn new things and you can punish anyone for wanting expand there knowledge the end traveling there right now seems impossible because the air pressure and heat would kill any human very shortly afore setting foot the planet but beleive that one day will diffidently there one day the future,2
car emmons have been real problem since the automobile industry has gone during the year car use the united states was all time high there are plethora problems with how much and how often people use their cars for example with the use all those cars the air pollution levels denly populated areas are dangerously high due all the cars that are present the air pollution causing acid rain than can very harmful people and even stripping paint from cars times car accidents due the large number cars killing thousands people each year and most all the environment causing some some habitats animals now unlivable for some animals some these problems coulby solved the community starts limit car usage and starts what they are told are pollution has started become giant problem among the entire world causing people inhale fumes from cars unintentionally and after while can cause many problems your body such cancer tuberculosis and among many others complications that can occur air pollution can also cubase places that are very nice start looking bit gloomy because all the bad cloud cover acid rain can cause massive destruction mass scale depending the level pollution the rain right now its not high but more and more cars are being produced and driven more and more pollution being emitted from the cars that are driven community help limit the use cars can help the amount acid the rain down and therefor helping out the earth not just our community,2

believe that the use driverless cars decent idea although does have downsides the idea drivers and passengers not having drive themselves would provide luxury feel most participants the driverless car movement this could also help with very common safety issues texting while driving intoxicated while driving just flat out not paying attention paragraph see that not only the driverless car and idea happening these manufacturers are still running track then should start see the sprout driverless cars this year this imply that people need start thinking and making decisions whether they want sit back and let computer the work not while can see the problem boredom stated paragraph think that this would empower the driver more she would able kick and and enjoy the ride without paying percent their undivided attention the road long trips and vacations would made much easier with this even for truck drivers who drive late night the united states has been exposed large amount deaths from texting while driving this could the end that while they would still need pay slight attention the warning signals given that they need grab the wheel the driver picked his her phone while computer drove them around wouldn too bad another issue imposed drivers being intoxicated and driving this would also solved with driverless car the driver wouldn pose danger themselves the passengers the vehicle being almost chauffered around this however could still issue the car needed the driver take control believe that driverless car would most definitely benefit drivers everywhere could solve many issues that stand due full attention driving and would cut the death rate from car accidents large chunk,3
when think about owning car that can drive itself blows mind never million years would think that lifetime this could possible many people believe that driverless cars are wonderful innovative idea the other side some people believe that driverless cars could dangerous favor driverless cars most aspects but would foolish think one sided there are many benefits driverless cars for specifically sometimes find hard get rides places with driverless car could anywhere anytime family are very busy sometimes different places the same time sometimes have rehearsal and brother has wrestling practice while parents are both work lot carpooling with driverless cars would lot easier there are some benefits but there are also some negatives driverless cars even though the companies manufacturing these called driverless cars have made sure they have every safety measure place there are still somethings even they can control weather can sometimes play big role how car drives wind and rain can effect your driving and sometimes even earthquakes and tornadoes strike when you are driving eventually they may produce tool that could combat this but right now don know how can get over this obstacle machines may react faster and smarter than humans but there will always small fraction accidents caused animals pedestrians the road don think should take for granted this improvement though look like this machines may not perfect but they are certainly better than humans humans don react quickly think about drunk drivers the amount accidents caused drunk would most likely exponentially decreased with driverless cars think our roads would significantly safer although driverless cars are still work progress think have made huge improvement our safety this goes through the next stage wouldn suprised saw less death due car accidents that position driverless cars,3

against the development driverless cars risky driving regular cars today you have lot careless drivers then there are still accident going currently also there could problems with the driverless car might not know about there are lot careless drives out the road wouldn such good idea put careless driver driverless car could cause danger for that person and those around them lots people would take advantage driverless car and wouldn aware the dangers that follow before anyone gets into driverless car need smart drivers there are still many car crashes today before begin make cars that can drive itself need figure out how stop car crashes now the article says that the car danger coming across contruction zone whatever the case may would alert the driver take the wheel but shouldn the other way around some drives might panic won know what since smart car should able handle situations like that driving very easy anyone can wouldn consider car being smart because can drive own different just not smart smart car will keep you out danger any comes your way would make sure you are safe the article says that the cars are computer driven cars computers freeze glitch slow down and much more since these cars are computer driven wouldn safe glitches happen may put your life danger and those around you computers still have problem and computer driven car would just add the problems against the idea driverless cars very risky thing the future have careless drivers car crashes glitches and other things that need solved before have computer driven car driving our roads may interesting idea but want safety for our people driverless cars really something think about,3
the face mars was not created aliens just natural landform you think that the face was created aliens sure have reasons but bet can make you change your mind the face mars there are multiple reasons why the face mars landform one reason why the face mars was not created aliens because garvin said that the face reminds him the middle butte the snake river plain idaho another reason why the face mars was not created aliens because when picture the face first appeared jpl web site said revealing natural landform also said there was alien monument after all also another reason why the face mars was not created aliens would that there was alien markings nasa even checked again for alien markings make sure that thre were none hidden behind haze and they still did not find any alien markings the last reason why the face mars was not created aliens because nasa took great clear pictures three times bigger then pixel size and found sign alien markings hope have changed you mind about thinking that aliens made the face mars these reasons that wrote about are all reasons why the face mars was not created aliens this why the face mars natural landform,2
believe that driverless cars are going very important nesset the development and transition transportation technology transportation will change from getting places using your own brain getting places without having really think about what you are doing while you are going somewhere feel that driverless cars will not only help with safety people while they are the road but also benefit people being able get places faster and get more things done the day while driving destination first off driverless cars will the safest way travel from place place this becuase all the safety features that are equiped driverless cars they contain numerous amount sensors and alert systems there was something that would harm you while the driverless car the car would either able get out the situation more effectively than experienced driver would able alert the driver take over and the driver would manually get out the situation the passage says that the google driverless cars contain many sensors some those sensors include the sensor the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps recieve and inertial motion sensor this shows first hand how safe the driverless cars are the driverless cars have many built sensors that even the most dangerous situation can avoided while driverless car next everyone owns uses driverless car get the places needs then the car can program itself get the place that needs efficiently and the best route possible this that the passengers and driver can get the destination quickly possible some point the only cars that are used are driverless cars and laws all states not just california nevada florida and washington have caught with the driverless cars then the cars will able move quicker and safer the destinations that are programed into the car the more driverless cars the road the faster the destination can acheived lastly you use driverless car the places you need the day you will able get multitude things done that you were not able get done before car companies like bmv are trying come with things that they can add the car have things while driving specific location you have emails that need sent presentation that needs made you can easily accomplish those tasks while driving the driverless car any point time the car will give you notification that you need take over driving for period time then all you have stop your work for short period time manually drive the car after that then you can get back what you were working before this will allow you get more things done the day that were not possible before conclusion think that driverless cars are the milestone the future and that they are going help expand the horizons multitasking safety and speed destinations driverless cars are the gateway the future and will really help the world whole keep moving and bring more great things like the driverless car the future who knows after the driverless car next could the flying car maybe even teleportation,4

there are three key reasons that nasa would not want hidden the evidence wouldn want ancient civilization one reason that having ancient civilization would key thing research another one would make the popularity and profits for nasa the third reason that the face two miles wide and resembles butte from the camera quality they wouldn want hide this civilization because they would have reasearch and more popularity nasa defenders say they wish there was civilization the article stated this about the nasa budget meanwhile defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars they want there one but that isn what nasa would get more donations and profit this was true this means nasa wouldn want deny even was true the reasoning the conspiracy theorists are wrong saying that they want hide this evidence because they don this would enable them accomplish farther space study and more information about extra territorial civilization the camera they used compared had way better camera also they stated the article april cloudless summer day cydonia mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look this takes out the reasoning the conspiracy theorists that their were clouds and shadows blocking the camera that made appear butte compared when looked like face nasa has done extensive research this topic and wished was true the facts prove not real and how would help nasa was the cameras have gotten better and people have reasoned better proves the mars face was natural mishap from shadows the two mile wide butte,3
driverless cars are something that google has been working for years some the biggest car manufacturers todays market are planning having autonomous cars production the year there still lot planning and designing before will able drive these cars but they will our future making driverless cars great idea and for most states have driving laws that make illegal drive even test these electronically driven cars manufacturers are getting hopeful that when these cars are ready safe and fully advanced the laws will changing first todays traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe cars has human driver control all times which means that the manufacturers must make car tahta keeps the driver passenger and any pedestrians safe manufacturers believe that once these cars prove more reliably safe that more states will grow onto the idea driverless cars having driverless cars good idea because they also will only use around half the fuel used todays average taxi far google has had these cars drive half million miles without single crash conclusion autonomous cars should part our future these cars have been test driven around miles without single crash driverless cars use sensors keep full picture detecting all the things surrounding the car even though there still some planning that needs done believe the world should give these new cars chance when the time right,2
think cars should still famous the future could make new cars such cars floating the air cars that can drive there own and drive anywhere want cars that could call wouldn use our sell phones all the time cars like the bmw could upgraded for the future and cars that have special senser the human driver can remain alert and cars that can drive its own and warn were going have accidents and google cars that can have fast wifi and people wont get boarded then one day they could come out with cars that can always gibe you heads and always tell you about the weather and hiw nice outside then one the drivers ask about the nearest place they could out eat park they could have reunion just chill then they could have cars that could drive you efferent states like nevada california florida district columbia and when something wrong with the car could worn the driver that its low gas something next the car could have anti lock breaks when ever the owner gets the car the car going stolen the car could shut down warn the spranger get out the car next the car could have any station like country rap hip hop just any kind music people like next they event new bmw that could speed mph and then when you wake the morning the car could already have your coffee for you the morning just case you might forget then they could come out with nother car called the hyper bmw wich the greatest car that has ever been anointed and they would have cars that would have been hovering around and taking every where finely when they make the car they could test out the cars using laser beams test drive the cars that drive there own and then when the car ready could sollied,2

claim that should study venus despite the dangers because the authors points nasa has solutions the hostile conditions researchers are working innovations for machines venus may well have been the most earth like planet first nasa has figured solutions the hostile conditions venus nasa have been working way survive thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide that blankets venus there also average temperature degrees fahrenheit and times greater atmospheric pressure than what are used people ask how will they overcome these extreme conditions and they have found one solution paragraph says imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the landscape this would solve the ground conditions would still hot around degrees fahrenheit the writer says and the air pressure would close that sea level not the best conditions but survivable for next that researchers are working innovations for machines make easier study venus the blimp like vehicle good but peering from miles above venus isnt that useful for studying that why nasa thinking about using some simplified electronics that are made silicon carbide nasa has tested this with simulation venus harmful conditions this way they could last weeks with the planets condition paragraph the writer wrote another project looking back old technology called mechanical computers they were first thought the and then played huge role during wwii systems that use mechanical parts can made resist the conditions venus the final statement that venus could have been earths most looked like planet paragraph the writer states that astronomers have thought that long ago venus was probably coveted largely with oceans and could have supported varios forms life like earth venus has rocky sediment surface and has familiar features lieko valleys mountains and craters venus also almost the same size earth conclusion nasa has solutions the hostile conditions researchers are working innovations for machines venus may well have been the most earth like planet maybe will finally get venus and see what the planet has offer,4

the author believe that studding venus could bring good things regardless its dangers life another planet sounds crazy but venus once many years ago had earth like features that could maybe prove that venus actually worth studding the real question can research done another planet with such high temperatures believe the risk isn worth the struggle but finding put more about venus could bring many benefits author claims yes could done with the right equipment but worth the risk could people live another planet with such high temperatures well the author claims the article venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the challenge this shows that life possibly existed venus many years ago and could maybe the future carry human life these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth such environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquefy many metals the challenge with the right equipment living venus could happen the long future but would people really what live robots soutter space avoiding the risks life different planet could bring benefits the long future the author brought many good reasons why his idea studding venus worthy trying despite the dangers with the right techology maybe the authors claim can proven and considered another planet for life,2
some know think venus not planet some know venus planet but all can agree that very interesting but why would use resources get venus here are some reasons why and not allow show you worth venus not the farthest planet actually not too far makes viable option the only thing that have not been able examine venus with amount distance between earth and venus which doesn give lot options but here what know first all venus known earths twin and not called earths twin for reason venus the same size and density which would make more accustomed our way livening sometimes venus actually even the closest planet timed right would make less the journey the only things not single unmanned ship has not survived for more than few hours when sent venus basically this tells the moment that mars more viable option because have actually landed unmanned ships collect data this why many people talk about mars instead venus some problems that get our way the air venus has thick atmosphere percent carbon dioxide not only that but venus atmosphere has highly corrosive acid the enviroment much more harsh than earth this means that will long time before get venus are bodies have adapted earth over the years but took over years for adapt this level can wait that long our savior nasa actually coming with ideas get there the moment they have been thinking making blimp like vehicle which will hover and fly high avoid storms and what not though would still hot but the air pressure close enough sea level what expect from nasa the future blimp that might make able get more data from venus maybe one day will able inhabit venus with the ideas they are coming with the fact the matter that going long time until get their seems mars the better option for now,3
the logical explication for the face being the moon the meteors had hit the planet mars and they all had landed together make face like object this planets crust make look like this well because this article says paragraph was huge rocks formation also another logical explication would was really hot one day and big fire had started mounting where there was lots dried out land and big fire started and when the fire stated there was big spot and the fire had reached and then was the particular shape face stood out onto the earths crust also says paragraph that lava dome this big landmark could also made big canion mountain that direct shape face just bunch trees could gathered together have perfect form shape face paragraph also talks about plain which open area with alot mountains anyways this all has explications other than aliens doing also like there could have been massive sand storm and the wind picked really heavy and was throwing rocks and blew alot sand and rocks and could have created face like object that you see when you look through telescope mars also say huge rock formation paragraph,2
the passage the challenge exploring venus the author supports the idea exploring venus despite the dangers there can the author describes exploring venus having value this means something that worth alot important find useful venus can another earth and maybe that way people can find many resources venus first the author despite the dangers that venus can the atmospheric pressure times greater then earth atmospheric pressure not one spaceship has survived the landing more than couple hours even though the dangers this can the author still says theres alot value venus scientist can not take samples rocks stuff that venus has structures nothing the pressure and unsafely land the surface next the author says paragraph that our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangeard and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation this saying the author saying that matter what dangers are they shouldn matter should not stop from earth expanded and growing shouldn stop them from exploring venus the author want know more about venus despite every kind danger and its challenging planet study finally after reading and discussing what the author suggests venus worthy but theurer are many dangers exploring venus dangers landing also dangers the atmospheric pressure the dangers other creatures being there throught all the author will still agree that its valuable and shouldn keep one from studying more,3

enter world where humans want depend technology for everything even the simplest tasks the idea driverless cars introduced what sounds like great idea now doesn have much potential when looked while these driverless cars are envisioned use half the fuel today taxis and offer more flexibility than bus there are still some aspects that don make the cars completely driverless before driverless cars make their huge impact the world some the minor details need further developed how often you hear people calling for transportation services such taxis aubers because they aren state mind and being good enough able operate motorized vehicle taxi systems were replaced with driverless cars who would drive those people home major flaw the driverless cars that they might require human assistance sometime throughout the trip there were spontaneous accident large work zone ahead while the only human the car was intoxicated that would pose lot danger for that driver and every other driver around the safety other drivers the road has taken into consideration making cars driverless means one would completely control the vehicle keeping that mind the case accident who would blame the driver could fault but then how really driver independent are these cars with the possibility that the car will more than likely need human assistance the driver themselves only slightly benefited just because driverless cars are assumed completely driverless actual human capable thinking and doing for the car indeed necessary where sure there are certain groups people that will benefit from being able get from point point without having think anything there still that larger population that will find almost practicality watching their vehicle drive itself when they are capable doing themselves aside from the safety features that comes with car having mind its own almost think better off without this technological advancement,4

the driverless cars seem big topic right now they are yet another example how our world changing years ago didn even have cars and now have cars that almost drive themselves this giant leap for astonishes think that not that long ago people had walk ride horse get somewhere this seems like the best invention ever right like any new invention though the driverless cars have their pros and cons driverless cars could change the world there much having driverless cars could for would allow for lot safer driving conditions majority accidents are said happen because distractions these distractions include things going the car outside the car and inside your head emotions tend have huge influence how drive with driverless cars you eliminate lot the multitasking that goes along with attempting drive and deal with these distractions with driverless cars you would only have grab the wheel and take over complicated situations the car can handle the car would most the driving for you which lessons the likely hood you having accident because the distractions having driverless cars would give just about anyone the ability drive driverless cars would allow for lot easier way for transportation you just hop the car program the gps and hang for the ride with all these pros having driverless cars people might not notice the cons these cars the driverless cars will eliminate lot accidents that occur everyday but could also give rise whole new set issues according the article safety best achieved with alert drivers the article also tells traffic laws were written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times when accident occurs who takes the blame the manufacturer who programmed the car the driver who let the accident happen after considering the pros and cons this car easy for see that this car terrific idea yes are looking lot issues with seeing who fault the result accident however could work out and develop some guidelines for who fault during accident looking one the world greatest inventions conclusion stand behind the driverless cars believe that the pros out weigh the cons this situation just figure out system for deciding who fault accident then have something could change the world transportation,4

this article making mona lisa smile talks about computer technology that can tell your emotions having computer able tell your emotions would pretty interesting right would just creepy fully develop computer programs that can tell our emotions and make something interesting based our emotions like states paragraph the lesson are learning school changed based our emotions you think students would learn more had lessons school based our emotions and how felt about the subject the computer could recognize were into the lesson not could have this technology and our lessons changed way that could make students want learn subject that daily basis made them want fall asleep the class they just could not find way get themselves interested the computer could change that for them this technology could very useful for our upcoming generations people already know that are slowly going become more digital world had these programs set for kids their own pace and learn things that interest them could have shorter school days and more time for children kids and have fun their life there large population students who choose not come school every day because school makes them unhappy they just hate some their classes because they know the job they want when they are older not everything they are learning going needed the outside world this technology could help show what emotions had towards different subjects then maybe would help teachers understand how teach their students the information way wont one ear and out the other there are going people who disagree with this new technology becoming part life because they might not want the technology have now there will always someone who not happy with the way life around them going because technology and sometimes technology does fail technology can shut down technology can make things have worked hard for disappear one second and won have all our hard work anymore what was once hard work second can become wasteful material although there are people who are going disagree with this technology and maybe spread rumors that faulty need this technology help better understand the world around say cop was trying figure out murder suicide had the technology figure out what emotions they show could tell they were murdered they commited suicide this technology could really help advance life and learn how understand things from new perspective this technology could believed improve our society and the way learn the way educate our children and the way have output life itself this technology could new meaning for life could make students learn lie school could help understand what going someones life could maybe even help solve crimes course there going people who will fight against this new technology but stick one day the technology can help understand why these people are against,5
people have their own opinions about the electoral college whether should taken away kept they have good reasons but honestly they really need the electors vote for our people the electoral college should abolished why people still defend the electoral college the voters don even vote for president they vote for slate electors why can voters control the electors you not really voting for the president you basically voting for electors who are pledged the specific candidate the electoral college isnt needed let the voters vote for who they want they know what that candidate gon na for their people when they become president don need people who are pledged that candidate keep debating over them states that when you vote for presidential candidate you are actually voting for slate electors the electoral college stays with only keep the voting balance they should just the winner take all everyone despises the electoral college has purpose retained but only keep the voting balanced,2

disagree with driverless cars driverless cars are not very smart idea just becuase google has made driverless cars since they have drove over half million miles without crash but google cars are not driverless they alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveway dealing with something bad happening near them the google driverless cars are not driverless thoughts about the driverless cars what happens the car crashes whos fault the person the car the manufacturer what get driverless cars what going happen insurance for cars insurance people will lose money and the car did crash its more money out your pocket fix winsted the insurance people having deal with some payment car manufactures like bmw audi ext have made more there cars safe for people and not think making them driverless would safe what the car goes nuts and the driver has control feel that get driverless cars more people will lose there life then without them can not always relies driverless cars the technology becuase one day will not have think need just drop the whole driverless cars and work more safety,2

imagine being driverless car and the car turing against you and crashing that the exact reason why aganist driverless cars feel like driverless cars are dangerous unreliable and not affordable this article made feel like even more unsafe than orginally thought feel like unsafe for people car that does not have driver because limited abilities and how little technology there for think that having driverless car dangerous because its limited abilities the article said that driverless cars can not navigate through work zones and around accidents pull and out the driveway the person the driver seat were fall asleep the wheel completely distracted how would vibrating their chair and flashing light get their attention the technology could malfunction and that extremely dangerous imagine being the passenger seat going mph highway and you have gaming device are watching your car and then out where you wrecked into something else you had warning adviser that you were dangerous situation because that technology failed you and just caused crash the only solution that could possibly work for manufactures have cameras the car watching the driver that positive could also negative based off how invasion privacy the smart roads would help these situations but would cost much money practically eliminated having driverless car plain out unreliable everyone has driverless car the roads would filled with computers and technology controlling every move and turn the roads just one thing could wrong and there could several car accident someones life could just have been taken what the steering starts acting and can stay the right lane and another car has driver who isn paying attention then they collide all that happened just because car steering started messing something even worse could happen for example the brakes stop working imagine going the speed limit down the street but someone was speeding and just got accident right front you the seats start vibrating you wake and see the situation time and try hit the brakes and didn work that would caused another accident based off unreliability with its technology the coordination system could mess and you end somewhere completely off target then what you were expecting all the unpredictable factors that make driverless cars unpredictable just overweight the positives car driving you because you don feel like driving could expensive for everyone get self driving car mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have self driving cars the question will able afford the car able pay the insurance most cars are expensive but affordable over course years because you pay monthly payment imagine buying this brand new self driving car and then crashing even though wasn your fault and you already went broke trying pay for how would you even able pay for get fix the thing you would not able too might expensive for the average person think just not smart have self driving cars the roads hazards for people mainly rely off when anything could wrong they are trying make more safe putting cameras vibrating seats and entertainment keep you away that all positive stuff but that doesn mean realistic there promise that any that could what expected think should just stick people driving cars for better and safer driving experience the road dangerous and unreliable and potentially expensive for the average person let let humans the driving and stop having technology run our lifes,5
about twenty five years ago the face was first discovered viking while was circling mars taking pictures nasa got the pictures and released them days after the mysterious rock was found the face settles the region cydonia mars people think that the face created aliens because the rock formation looked like egyptian pharaoh however not arguments about the face have been going since the first picture was released here tell you that the face natural landform when people argue about the miraculous rock formation they say that there was life mars and that the aliens built the face because appears have mouth nose and eyes some questions get lot are how did get there why does have human face and how did naturally get prominent face features human not know how the face got its human feature but through all the tests have done mars there are aliens found and that the face just fantasmic natural made wonder space when get more information about the face will certainly let you know,2

the author supports his idea describing venus very well way the text the author tell about venus and tell about how venus could also says that venus could just like earth venus the most dangerous planet because has very high temperatures the hottest planet but this lanett important the same time because our planet sister what this means that venus and earth look alike but venus more dangerous and has differences too one reason why venus dangerous because the hottest planet the firsts paragraph the author says how bright venus says that bright because closets the sun and that also has nickname the text says venus sometimes called the evening star one the brightest points the night sky this shows that telling how bright venus the author also says that venus actually planet the text says our solar system venus the second planet from our sun this show that venus planet and also how describe venus another reason why how the author describes venus that venus looks just like earth the second paragraph the author says venus often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too this show how the author comparing venus earth and also how describe venus very well way venus danger because the closest planets the sun which means that very hot and can burned and damage person very bad way person could die because how hot venus the text the author says since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours maybe this issue explains why not single spacecraft has touched down venus more than three decades this show that venus hard planet study because how hot the planet conclusion venus has almost percent carbon dioxide and has clouds corrosive acid the atmosphere the text says trick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere this show the danger that venus planet venus was very high temperatures the text says the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times grether than what experience our own planets this show that human wouldn able survive venus because the high temperatures times grether then the temperature experience our planet then can not imagine human would literally kill the person venus has the hottest surface any other planet even tho the closest one the sun mercury venus also our sister planet,3
driverless cars let talk about that year bmw announced the development traffic jam assistant this cars speed goes mph meanwhile cars that can drive over mph this car can also notify the driver when the car needs taken control vibrations are one the notifications the car will give you there seems problem with backing into something the google car can announce itself when the car should taken over flashing lights the windshield another way for notifying the driver all these simple small notification symptoms are meaningless you fall asleep while sitting the car seat while your car driving for you this will all new crashing scale for the records think all the possible ways that this manufacture driving car can cause much harm the casualties would off the charts television shows have displayed driverless car many times the past and people have yet seem realize that those are movies not reality movies are works art created ones mind imagination motive show then there should reason why isn real already not mention the price having driverless car would cost lot money why you ask they new rare and there lot sensors built into the car and gps recieve driverless cars are dangerous because there still lot mindless drivers out there the world and driverless cars can simply comprehend the speed and damage another person can within seconds these types cars and stop there something the way behind the car but what can the cars when there speeding car coming right towards you can drive and spin off somewhere stopping wouldn thing especially you stop light these types cars need whole lot more thinking and technical fixes put into this idea before they can become anything worth wanting,3
cars are life line and much used tool for people day day commutes can live without vauban germany there town that does not own one car how they get around then they city trans and running the reason the cars are spouting out tons green gasses its not only vauban either this trend world wide most suburbs does everyone agree with this car trend after paris received near record pollution they banned driving the city some days the city would allow odd licence plates other days the city would allow even number plates near drivers were given euro fine this cleared the smog over period time what was the effect the city after words smog cleared from the city vassily but citizens were able freely use the transit without cost there were accretions plug cars and vices holding more than three people the other side the world people bogota colombia created and set carfree day this day people hiked biked and took buses destinations this was celent strategy promote alternative transportation and reduced pollution for this large city million people who did not along with the day were fined now more close cities cali and valledupar have joined the event this has been amazing for upcoming local city buisness also reconstruction side walks and parks what about the largest car loving contry america well seems the trend has effected well although there are limits the driving has seemingly cooled over the years this will long term cultural shift with companies like ford and mercedes calling themselves mobility companies when someone does drop the habit hard pick again even driving young people has dropped these changes have changed the pollution rate and many more car related problems there mabey time where traffic jams longer exist,3
driverless cars used seem like impossible idea but now these dreams are becoming reality driverless cars are innovative technology and should developed because how helpful they are the article says that driverless cars are forseen use half the fuel today taxis world where everyone clamoring find alternative fuel sources driverless cars would help tremendously cutting back using nonrenewable resources would both cost effective and environmentally friendly even though may cost more money develop these new cars using less fuel one easy way make for that cost using autonomous cars takes out the factor human error driving with driverless cars there would such thing drunk driving texting and driving you would not hear about devastating accidents because someone was distracted while driving while completely driverless cars are close possibility there will large debate over their development and fortunately there time for that however driverless cars are beneficial the environment cost effective and even safer with the right technology and therefore should both developed and used,3
the article driverless cars are coming the author presents both positive and negative aspects driverless cars opinion against the development these cars think that this cars are not safe and would expensive firstly the driverless cars opinion are not safe think this because technology can always wrong matter how much time money spent you just never know when can wrong for example the article stated that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safest car has human driver control all times insane that people are trying develop driverless car when the law proven not safe another example the article states that technology fails and someone injured who would the fault lie this shows that with driverless cars technology will fail any time and can cause accident innocent people who the first place where never support driverless cars secondly the driverless cars should not developed because they are expensive not only for individual people but for the country for example the article states that the smarta sytems work surprisingly well but that they require massive upgrades existing roads that was simply expensive practical driverless cars would require the upgrade not only part indians road but the whole and the world which tremendous amount money that would needed upgrade all the roads driverless cars not only need upgrades road safer and work better but the car itself needs alot expensive technology operate correctly and safely for example driverless car needs spinning sensor the roof dubbed lidar uses laser beams form constant updating model the car surroundings and much more needed for the driverless car mimic the skills human the wheel conclusion driverless cars are not and will not any much safer then human the wheel and the cars are expensive and would waste money for the country driverless cars will fail some point because technolgy fails why risk the life innocent people the cars are expensive why waste much money driverless car they are not needed but are only desire human imaginacion inclusive luxury for many,4

guess this paragraph going about technology and stuff which cool after all plan the greatest actor the world someday pretty much have know about technology eventually however right now its kind irrelevant well lets not say that say more the lines confusing speak like first all its painting who cares how she was feeling you know got topic basically the real question the technology used recognize emotions valuable not luckily for you guys have opinion which may may not ignorant not but for your question ill answer about paragraphs but for now before begin will say will certainly change our world know for the better let tell you why now according the paragraph the machine supposed use computer model all facial muscles which called action unit using the classified main emotions which are happiness fear surprise anger discus fear and sadness all which all humans feel regular basis know seems kind weird but you know could actually useful the near future like may able use for interrogation for criminals the other thing could with evolve race could upgrade our technology and able detect moods instead emotions mind blown right think the future will pretty cool the future will cool because were actually pull that off could understand each other better this paragraph about how the facial action coding system can help the future think valuable for crime uses science stuff basically for all professions you could even use for day day life for rehab something definitely think they should make mood changer enhance but for the emotions think its just neat and cool thing like opinion unless you upgrade mood sensor kind useless and boring and basically not valuable but dont listen this coming from foot year old all means dont let discourage you say you want for really dont see the use tin class honest its more like toy than machine guss its cool for museums see paintings but thats just opinion,2

the face mars nothing more than natural landform just like the grand canyon natural landform the area will prove that only just land form first reason being landform the age the picture the first picture taken was back one ixil the picture was meters long the best picture taken the viking but for the picture took each ixil was meters long the picture took back blur compared the picture took second reason conspiracies conspiracies are not backed with confirmed information which makes not believable conspiracies look the picture took which roughly year difference than the picture took but the ixil difference was huge which proves that the picture took the one that looks like face not very accurate since there has not been confirmed ancient life mars would make even harder belive conspiracists are near being anywhere being true come conclusion the information used prove that the face was made aliens inaccurate not only that but also out date and overlapped the new and more accurate picture,2
extensive analysis the text indicates that the use driverless cars will drastically improve the world and the quality living our society new sensor technology today like the dubbed lidar allows for safer smarter and more efficient driverless cars driverless cars are the future todays society and should embraced instead restricted first and foremost reality driverless cars are not truly driverless the car early assists the driver driving make easier and safer for drivers driverless cars utilise board sensor arrays and outside communication effectively make sure the driver and the passengers are safe transit while inside driverless car the driver must stay alert and ready for work zones accidents new iterations the driverless cars are catering the concern that drivers driverless cars could offtake whilst driving which mahorn safety concern they responded allowing the driver heads displays and the ability turn off the autori any time take control the driving the other hand laws many states ban driverless cars because the current driving laws all revolve around the driver controling the car not the other way around also lawmakers argue that cases accident including driverless car would much more complicated because one would know who fault the driver the manufacturer this issue with lawmakers certain states holding back the driverless car industry greatly conclude certain automakers are still evolving and revolutionizing the driverless car industry tesla announced autonomous car and mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have manufactured driverless cars the driverless car industry obviously has many more hoops jump through and has lot potential but still theory and not yet concept although struggling through public and legislative support the driverless car industry still strives and continues make big leaps into the future for mankind,4

the idea driverless cars sounds futuristic but wouldn trust one something can wrong with the car and there wouldn anyone blame not that looking for someone blame but someone could get injured hurt very badly just because car stopped working lot people been car accidents before now imagine how bad would the cars drove themselves would nice not have drive and get drove but how can you trust car accident can happen using the driverless car and what would happen the passengers can blamed the car can and neither can the manufactories lot technology has stopped working can get broken and lot stuff can happen with one simple mistake now imagine that there would only driverless cars how ridiculous does that sound how are the cars even going know the laws most people would say the car would have computer that would know the laws there always new laws and how would the computer know the new ones what the computer gets the laws mixed computer can stop working and you might not even know person mixes the laws they can get ticket even get sent court for not knowing them could keep the roads safer the car messes and what would happen the car gets taken away goes get fixed most driverless cars that have now still need driver how pointless does that sound might well just drive yourself texting and driving big issue the century people will think they can now text with the driverless car and won even notice what happening the road driverless cars aren going make the world better and neither will they stop accidents from happening once driverless car gets into accident one will want one pretty sure will happen someday and would then pointless keep manufacturing them driverless cars are just too much like paying for computer drive you you can trust one they might crash break and even something you didn tell not everyone might agree with but know for sure that one would buy one after accident happens please don risk your life buying driverless car,4

driverless cars should continue develop and made more efficiently these cars will help keep the driver and passengers safe the future the manufacturers continue test and develop these driverless cars also important that the human race continues advance everything can time goes things will change and the human race will eventually forced evolve with driverless cars have been around since according the article google being one the main benefactors has had their cars drive more than half million miles without crash para these cars still have human driver and the car made alert the drive when the car can not function own for example there was accident get around roadwork the car would alert the driver google still trying change their driverless cars and make them even more safe for those who are and around the car safety huge issue with driverless cars and the manufacturers who make them have come make safety one their main priorities google changed toyota prius adding sensors all around the car theses sensors are placed areas where the vehicle should able detect almost anything that goes them between certain range depends how close fairway object for the sensor detect google even added dubbed lidar uses laser beams form constantly updating model the car surroundings para all all the benefits having driverless car our future would neverending there were ways reduce deaths due car accidents texting while driving then should happen safety should key when comes automated vehicles and the next step for safety with vehicles will with using driverless cars driverless cars are the future and they will what our next generation uses,4
there are many positive and negative outcomes that could come from the driverless cars believe driverless cars shouldn created for public use because they waste money and energy they waste money because they aren really needed help society progress they would also waste energy because people are wasting time trying prefect them when don really need them driverless cars would also take alot resouces like metals and cables that could used more important things that could actually benefit from some car manufacturers could cause more harm people rather than helping them because they not fully perfecting the cars and causes more damage than neccessary also believe shouldn have driverless cars because people will spend too much time these cars and changing the driving laws that even they may think the car will know what every moment accident occurs they still won know who hold responsible someone injured the cars were released the public then the time take change the laws would give time for the cars malfunction even more they also waste time and money trying make the roads compatible with the cars using electric wiring instead the basic roads use now finally think shouldn have these cars because even they perfect them then safety will only provided precent the time making the chances accident higher and they would cause more navigational problems,3
what does look look like you the face mars just landform like many other nasa scientist not beleive that was made ancient civilizations aliens the pictures that have taken from the planet mars first indicated type face but now that with our newer technology seen that just mesa butte nasa has even provided real photos taken the mars but still many disagree that simply just landform nasa sending out the viking and bringing back that picture has made big impact nasa alot scientist did not beleive that was face but the face mars has become pop icon this face mars starred hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout linescore years but nasa scientist were still bit doubtfully nasa felt that was important tax payers see the for sure the the face mars was really face all when mars global surveyor mgs flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper that the original viking photos thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform all these people believed that was face but actually turned out from real pictures taken landform but still not everyone was content with that the face mars located degrees north martian latitude where was winter april cloudy time the year the red planet the camera that took the last picture the face mars had peer through wispy clouds see the face april cloudless summer day cydonia mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look and once again the even more advanced picture the face mars looked like mesa butte now some people will say that nasa trying cover something that they are hiding something from the public others say that nasa doesn want people know there are aliens out there but what people lack that accusation the fact that nasa would discovered aliens would one the most popular and profitable organizations earth nasa trying verify spending millions dollars global surveyors take pictures cydonia the face mars really face not them trying hide anything fact its nasa trying satisfy the public best ways they can and people even say that the pictures arent good enough tell for sure nasa surveyor camera pixel had span meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo conclusion even though you dont beleive that its natural landform and understand why facts and real photos beg differ that idea face the mars all the times nasa has sent out surveyors bring pictures the public the public just gave them garbage honestly all can say that all the facts and pictures that nasa has provided with understand the face landform for reason and thats people can see and decide for themselves whether face landform but really scientist and entire corporation inelegant scientist with high degrees say its landform then that they aren going lie entire planet people,5
you think computers being able tell students emotions useful say could useful could tell the student bored which that could help try make the student more interested what about learn this could also tell anyone feeling hurt depressed because something that happened them which could probably help the student with the problem they have could tell the student slacking off the student needs extra help this would useful help students stay active and interested what they are going learn would tell the student bored and that could help find another way make the kid more interested what are learning would also tell the kid was slacking off which kid was slacking off could move him and let him more comfortable where could more interested and pay attention the things about learn would able help out your child many peoples children could help them get track and maybe help them get scholarship and give them better understanding school and education would you want your childs emotions read computer imagine your child was going through something that happened him theses computers could help figure what wrong with your child and maybe that the problem why not paying attention could help many children this could lead and help students success your child failing school might because being bored which these computers would tell and oul find another way help your child wouldn failing need let people know that this could solve many problems your child new something bad was going happen knew student was getting bullied was getting bullied could find that out with the computer and help them out could help kids from harming themself just think about how many kids could save you wish you had these computers when you were younger say yes this ould have helped better school and could have told teachers that needed extra help just think about how many kids could succesful because theses computers think about how could help you out you were able have theses computers when you were school,3

belive that the technology can some what invalided because you cant exactly tell how person thinks feels because they could sad the inside but show numeral face the outside they could crying but while crying but crying tears joy how could computer tell you the way that someone feels they could feel totally different way way person looks the outside may not the way that they are feeling the inside computer not person doesnt have emotions how exactly could tell what the emotions another person how they are feeling the time dont belive that many people can tell the difference fake smile real smile let alone how can computer tell the difference between fake real smile because people think happy alot usally fake smile because sad the inside but look happy the outside with saying that just looking person can deceiving because you never know how the person exactly feels what going there head therefore belive that the facs can not tell persons emotions,2
the author presents postive impact driving because driving will safer with the smart cars driving will much easier with the smart cars and people will have better time driving driving will safer with the smart cars paragraph the author states the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manager alone this statement from the author the article shows that the smart cars sensors detect things faster than human another example states there are sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor after reading that statement makes people feel safe being car that can basically detect everything around them driving will much easier with the smart cars paragraph the writer states all the cars are able steer accelerate and brake themselves this statement big help drivers who get tired steering all the time when driving the writer also states the car can handle driving functions speeds mph this would great for drivers would help them get around town especially for people who live small citys people will have better time driving paragraph states some manufactuers hope bring fun driving bringing entertainment and informational systems this would make driving lot better another example states drivers will ables text now with the smart car while driving the author presents postive impact driving because driving will safer with the smart cars driving will much easier with the smart cars people will have better time driving,3
driverless cars seem like wonderful idea but produce many threats that may not worth opinion driverless cars are mistake even though the idea good not very practical all basically self driving car manufacturers are asking drivers trust our lives sensors and blinking lights self driving cars still rely humans take over when things get too difficult even though google has been testing automated driving systems since they still can use them practically the roads what happens when you sitting down using the heads displays meant keep you busy and you start drift off sure the car has noises and vibrations wake you but some people are heavy sleepers that won woken even all that commotion and even does wake you would have sudden loud noise movement and that can induce panic causing the driver swerve off the road then you have crashes lawsuits and injury even death that another point that must addressed who blame when the inevitable crashes occur the driver fault for trusting the technology the manufacturers fault for producing systems that arent perfect enough trust our lives with and what about drivers who refuse trust the systems the first place how will the cars react against the human element many people are against these self driving cars and will refuse trust their lives robots humans are unpredictable and often times don pay attention the road drive under the influence leaving element surprise that the robots have react split second and middle class family even upper class might reluctant spend the money the cars and systems necessary allow for automated driving self driving cars are not the future automobile deaths are decreasing every year cars get safer and more reliable there reason introduce new problem that will just cause more deaths and inevitably end tragedy humans should not put their lives the hands sensors that just blind stupidity the lawsuits cost and having put full trust into computer should proof enough,4
driverless cars can good thing bad thing depending how their used driverless cars are needed some cases driverless cars could create more accidents and also can creat less problems driverless cars could distraction for the world driverless cars will also cause problems with health because the owner might lazy and become obese driverless cars can good thing bad thing depending how thier used because people always try take advantage things driverless cars would good for people who have disability driverless cars may not good all cases cause the driver would still have the car because they would have drive for themselves navigation through workes and when accidents occur the person behind the wheel might asleep busy doing other things which would cause for another accident happen long driverless cars are used well and not abused because driverless cars could useless driverless cars are needed some cases they would take place taxi people occasionally like out bars clubs events and drink beers and other beverages that can make them under the influence those drivers not need behind wheel operating vehicle they become danger and could injure and sometimes kill people innocence driverless cars would good for people who are disabled because they could help them move around and places which could could help them out driverless cars are needed cases women were pregnant person injured they could get home hospital driverless cars could distraction for the world taxi and cab drivers could lose their jobs which could make the unemployement rate and america cant afford for that happen driverless cars could make people lose their focus and also can harder for people focus till the road people would get the idea that just because they dont have the car even operating the car that they could lose focus driverless cars are really not needed because people need more focused the road and not doing other things limit possible distractions driverless cars could also create health problems the route the person has cleared from accidents and road work sites then they could fine people need moving every muscle their body little things like pushing your foot down the gas pedal the brakes move the muscle your leg driverless cars can good thing bad thing depending how their used driverless cars are needed some cases driverless cars could create less accidents and also create less problems driverless cars could distraction for the world driverless cars will also cause problems with health because the owner might lazy and become obese driverless cars are only needed they could used positive ways,3
you think that having driverless car honestly for safety reasons just for famous and just able say look car can drive itself this artifical the author talks about how can safer how will save money gas millage and some other things option think this horrible idea and going tell you why just pulling facts from this artifical for first reason why dont think this good idea because the artifical states the cars will need whole lot sensors that sounds horrible because what one sensor goes bad and the driver has idea and becomes late find out and next thing you know balaam theres accident that happens second reason why think this isnt good idea they clam that the cars will have antilock brakes and what happens when the brakes dont become antilock anymore wreck and even death happens third arguement this they state that there waiting the law believe that the law thinking correctly why their not sure whether let this okay not let this okay the artifical states new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident was driving car like this and hit someone and killed them just got plan wreck would blame the manufacture ony because when someone buys these driverless cars they are told bunch things and driver would expect belive that this car will all those things whether new laws were passed these things would become legal would still put fight for that would also have the manufactures fault also that right there third reasoning why dont think this good idea these are all three reasons from the artifical why dont think that driverless cars will good impact the world today ever,3
the development driverless cars can dangerous for our society google made car that could drive itself certain conditions these cars have been banned certain states against the law test drive them these states how are supposed know how these cars other conditions states have them banned for their states safety driverless cars can only assist driving not drive the car itself the general motors made car that could drive its own special test track this special test track was embedded with electrical cable that sent radio signals recieve the front end the car driverless cars are coming this track could easily stop the car needed but dont know how would out the real world with other people there are alot sensors the car google modified oyata prius there are sensors the left rear wheel sensor the roof camera ner the rearview mirror automotive radar sensors and gps sure having lot sensors carwood help the car pick motion around but what something happened the car one the sensors broke out the the car wouldn able pick movement around the car bmw car manufactuers developed traffic jam assistant driverless cars are coming the car with traffic jam assistant can handle any driving function mph long the driver keeps their hands the wheel the car can steer itself which isn safe because the car might see the need turn itself one direction and accidently hit car based its sensors need steer left but the sensor can really sensitise any movement the car can accelerate and brake itself also the car alon can faster when doesnt need stop either way can cause accident the driverless cars movement needs slow down and test its self more and more becoming out the real world the car relies much its sensors when feels the need switch back giving the driver control driverless cars might seem pretty cool now but wont when everyone starts get one,3
name profesor yaddo and colleague and were discussing the infamous face mars colleague believes superstition and conspiracies stated that the face mars must extraterrestrial origin said that was preposterous but colleague continued try and convince availed told colleague there are many reasons why the some scientists and people thought the face mars looked like face then proceded tell him reasons first off cameras the time were not advanced they are today the cameras the day would distort the image and would only capture the major features the butte mesa the most recent image taken the face mars looks very different from the original image taken there was actual structure left aliens modern cameras would able see the the more modern cameras today are able see the more defining features object secondly humans are remarkably good seeing faces when there not one there when you look wall socket you can see what resembles face when there not one there the same thing with the face mars with the aid shadows from the sun are ability see faces when none are there and the angle the picture was taken the butte mesa looks remarkably like face some alien made structure response what said colleague had some things say try and disprove due colleague believing superstition and conspiracies believed nasa and the government are hiding the truth from stated they were hiding this from because what happened with wells the war the worlds which caused massive panic the government don want another mass panic they have been keeping away from the truth that aliens exist colleague also stated that possibly alien markings were hidden haze some other theorists thing thought that was preposterous but colleague still believed the theory aliens existing even though hmy colleague still believes the face mars alien made structure still believe only butte mesa with evidence the face mars only looking like face due the techonology the time the shadows the sun the angle the picture was taken and our ability see faces when none are there believe have conclusive evidence that the face mars nothing but butte mesa,4
the worthley studying venus pursuit despite the danger presents studding the venus comes whole bunch pros and cons one the good things are they get explore what they have always wanted they get figure out whole other life different planet and because you study and really get then youll maybe the first few people long time humans numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world each pervious mission was unmanned and for good reasons since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours more people learn about venus and want venus then would have more people surviving and having more spaceships touching venus and maybe life their that why think more people should study the planet venus even though might have some ups and downs but the end the day more people would want get involved with the space things and would have more people traveling their learning all sorts new things and bringing back the earth,2
dear state senator writing this letter talk about how the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational first the electoral college unfair voters second there could tie the electoral vote last the voters are merely voting for the slate electors rather than the president those are points why take away the electoral college start this off the electoral college unfair the voters because the winner take all system each state the candidates don take time other states that they know they will lose they only really focus the swing states for example during the campaign seventeen stateside see the candidates their state all also the largest media markets had not seen single campaign from candidate also unfair because voters don really know who vote for because they see campaign ads and candidates don show their state and tell them what she running for that why the electoral college unfair voters the presidential election second there could tie the electoral vote the case the tie would straight the house representatives where state delegations vote for the president this the house decision where close that the people their state the election mly few swing voters away from catastrophe that why bad the vote ends tie lastly the voters are merely voting for the slate electors rather than the president for instance you lived texas and wanted vote for john kerry you vote for slate democratic electors pledged kerry the worst part that the electors could anyone you don even have hold political position elector they could very biased and narrowminded that why the electoral college unfair conclusion senator the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational because unfair voters there could tie the electoral vote and the voters are merely voting for slate electors and not there president senator would like for you take this into consideration and abolish the electoral college,4
yes the driverless car has its ups and downs but whole tuley belive this car wonderful think great opportunity for people who don always like driving can say for self don always injo driving because sometimes gets confusing makes frustrated think that having driverless car will show weather people are responsible enough for stuff like this obviously driver buys this car just they don have worry about driving they can text and drive you can tell that they aren responsible but there are some people that actually care about rode safty and would treat this car with the same responsiblity the other car there are lot ways that can make sure people are paying attention really like the idea how can put cameras make sure the driver the car staying alert and paying attention the road like the artifical said while the driver watches road the car watches the driver with the cameras can catch people the wrong thing even they don have driverless car the cameras will able see people who look like they are speeding they can see people that text and drive they will also able catch the people that are under the influence drugs and alcohol there are positives the driverless car and making more driver safty the other cars like said the driver still has stay alert the road and one thing that will help that how the seat vibrates when the car danger backing into something this will help person having trouble see behind the car they feel vibration they know take charge the car the artifical asked what the driver wants drive the car and take charge think with the vibrating seats this will helps the driver take charge and what think most imporant who held responsible there car accident and someone gets injured the driver the manufacturers know that car accidents are going happen weather you mean you don even you are driving car that isn driverless you can get accident because there aways going that one person that drinks and drives texting someone accidents happen this question think would both the manufacturers and the drivers fault think this because yeas the drivers should alert everything that going the road even they aren driving and part the manufacturers fault because they are the ones that trust with this type car know that there are people out the would that will take for advantage first when read the title haught driverless car way would never buy one those but now that read this can say that driverless car would great have why don make happen because know one day would definately buy one and will one the people that pay attention thr road and have diver safty,4
the challenge exploring venus the author suggest that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the following topics the author used helped support this idea the challenges dangers and the fascinations with venus needs explored our neighboring twin that can only observe hovering far above hopping get much detail possible creates challenge due how unsafe our scientists have sent numerous spacecrafts venus but each previous mission was unmanned because spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours also due the high pressures and heat this planet there venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land the surface due the challenges makes much more dangerous since venus second our sun and has atmosphere precent carbon dioxide blanket and temperature average over degrees fahrenheit makes really hard for nasa get close look venus unsafe temperatures also venus has atmospheric pressure that times greater than what humans experience our own plant which way more extreme than anything have had encounter plus nasa were able find away float thirty plus miles above the surface would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the bright side would have the air pressure close sea level earth but despite these challenges and dangers there plenty fascinations with this planet astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system also venus still has some features similar earth such valleys mountains and craters making more scientist want explore see was once habitual other creatures further more making then suspect that venus was probably once covered largely with oceans based the author hitting the points that exploring venus can challenging dangerous but yet fascinating helps get across the fact the feels like despite the dangers venus presents still worthy pursuit study,4
venus the nearest planet our earth exploring will important job because people not lot about venus the author support his idea studying venus despite dangers condition such high temperatures atmospheric pressure and each previous mission have fallen venus the nearest planet our planet have very high temperatures high temperature makes hard for astronomers explore venus but the author still want learn more about the article state astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system that quot show how much the aeronautic and apace administration wanted explore our nearest planet and because people know little about venus the nasa want know about the author still show that want explore venus despite atmospheric pressure the atmospheric pressure about times greater than what people experience here earth the author state that recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel the quot shows that wanted explore venus long time long and doing what can now able venus still have faith that one day will venus despite many challenges some previous mission have fallen because the spacecraft was not good enough but now there working making new spacecraft that will able land for faw days weeks able explore more about venus the article state that some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating that chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditons the quot shows that they are working new electronics help them explore venus and learn more about the author not want let dangers doubts stop the from exploring venus venus the closest planet our planet have lot things that people know about but despite bad condition the author conclude not let thing stop him from exploring venus people knows that exploring venus will hard work accomplish many are hoping that soon they will able accomplish their dream,3
the article making mona lisa smile the author describes how new technology called the facial action coding system enables computers identify human emotions feel this technology can useful but weird because can help popel able want learn but make you like the computer watching example how can help paragraph paragraph gives facts and why should use the computer paragraph says the computer will bring you smile that little werd werd paragraph give steps you should try out paragraph gives examples and says did the computer bring smile your face like its just much their computer that understands you dont that make you fell weird like computer are becoming more human then and that scars more then anything like cant have computer watching but dont get wrong this could great said this can help people who dont like learn want learn better themself like right the middle like its but dont trust one bit all like just makes feel computer watching now test like know technology growing but the technology ias become more human then already,2

with the new facial action coding system facs old boundaries can now broken this new system allows special computers recognize the emotions peston expressing the software advanced that can even depict someone presented emotions are real forced thomas huang who invented facs grudges that this technology would great improvement classrooms and right using facial action coding system would help engage students their academics and allow them reach new level potential the facs was classroom their computers would have the capacity detect when student bored confused frustrated having technology that could read students emotions would allow the computers detect students were bored not challenged struggling which would make the computer then modify the lesson predicts huang more interesting advanced activate helpful tools this would major improvement schools facs was implemented schools students would less likely get bored left behind stressed the facial action coding system when into affect and student longer felt bored stressed left behind think how that would change students potential students would have improved gpas and grades they would less likely fall short classes and therefore take more advanced classes even likely that more students would not drop out high school and more would get into college and with better scholarships most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication states huang “ so computers need understand that too computers high schools were able understand their users feelings the students would have greatly improved learning experiences when there increase educational tools that help students they will more likely succeed students had the opportunity benefit from facs high schools their impact society could much greater,4
nasa has recently been discussing what believed face mars some people think that this some kind alien marking the essay says scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh paragraph this may convince certain people believe that there was once life mars while may true the essay does not say anything about anyone actually getting mars see was really just rock maybe there were bones from human body attached the head also the essay states although few scientists believed the face was alien artifact photographing cydonia became priority for nasa when mars global surveyor arrived the red planet september eighteen long years after the viking missions ended paragraph result the essay also said felt this was important taxpayers explained jim garvin chief scientist for nasa mars exploration program paragraph this statement could implying that they could making stuff just for money they put that the newspaper everyone would want buy which would result making lot money addition the essay says only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh paragraph this evidence from the article supports claim and says shadows made look like something could also have been the way something was reflecting off conclusion believe that this thing was just natural landform many have seen weird shaped rocks sometimes just dont pay attention also just like the sun forms shadows that could have been what happened mars make people believe they were seeing human face,3
the use this technology read students emotional expressions good idea think this good idea because say student was having bad day school the computer can tell you are having bad day and the teacher wouldnt ask any questions try make you stand infront the class reading book doing math problem the board this technology will help both the student and the teacher have better and more understanding relationship this article making mona lisa smile shows many examples evidence that support claim like the facial expressions for each emotion are universal observes huang even though individuals often show varying degrees expression like not smiling broadly using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements real face the painted face the mona lisa another example supporting claim classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this great and fun way use technology will help teachers modify their lessons fit not only the schools need teaching but the students way learning the students will longer confused about assignment instead they will able learn and grow better than they was regular classroom this why think should have facial action coding system our classrooms,3

against the development driverless cars don think they should develope theses cars becasue they still need driver they cause issue with the law and they are inconvenient the driverless cars this passage referring still require the drivers full attraction and dence the passages states they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill such navigating through work zones and around accidents from this statement see that the car needs human difficult task that teh drivers are trying avoid the smart cars are new the world there are not many laws about them creating unsafe enviroment the artifical states result many states illegal even test computer driven cars there are four states including the distric columbia that allow smart cars the text also states the technology fails and someone gets hurt who faul teh driver the manufacturer this brings new problem there will endless amounts cases having with wrecks today with human driven cars the driver blame for accident that leads the injury someone eles there confusions the matter the text states wouldn drivers get bored waiting there turn drive the driver just having wait for something happen they take over they will loose concertation people loose track what techy are doing while driving making where they dont have not such good idea the text also states the car can handel driving functions speeds mph but speciale touch sensors make sure teh driver keeps hold teh wheel the driver must keep hold the wheel the whole time would like they are driving the car themselves giving reason for the car ran computer dont think they should contine with the development the smart cars they still need driver they cause issues with the law and they are inconvenient,3
dear state senator know you have been thinking about should still use electoral collage changing election popular vote for the president the united states here inform you that believe that keeping the electoral college may still help having electoral college you can swing states and biggers states begin with keeping the electoral college may good idea when having you could swing states the passage defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president the passage states that the winner take all method awarding electoral votes induces the candidates paragraph the moute explaining that having candidates from toss states the voters would help the elections the voters would actually interested the election and pay attention what happening having voters from toss states may help decide the election second keeping electoral college may benefit many ways keep electoral college than would bring bigger states the passage its states that the electoral college restores some the weight the political balance that large states population lose virtue the mal apportionment the senate decreed the constitution paragraph the quote explain that when there bigger state involved then the larger states would get the most attention from any presidential candidates being larger states give people more advantage example they gave the paragraph big states explains that the popular vote was very close florida nevertheless obama who won that vote got electoral votes the example was explaining that since florida was bigger got more votes that lead obama winning conclusion thats why believe should keep electoral college electoral collage would swing states and involve big states,3

over many years technology has become more and more advanced some this technology has become far that can now detect human facial expression and determine what emotion they are expressing this technology called facial action coding system facs technology and enables computers identify human emotions this technology can have positive impact school classrooms today facs can help improve the way students learn schools they way teachers teach their students and most importantly help teachers detect when student feeling confused one the main positive impacts facs can have reading emotional expressions students classroom improve the way students learn facs can scan the facial expressions the students the classroom and determined the majority the students are confused the lasson the teacher teaching facs could then modify the lesson way that students can understand and the teacher can then further clarify the lesson the way facs shows stated paragraph six then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this shows how facs can help teachers the way they teach this could also explain teachers how clarify even more the lesson students that may going through hard times another way facs can have great impact schools all around the country improving the way teachers teach their classrooms facs can detect many expressions students classroom can detect whether student perplexed lesson simply just bored facs can detect which students the classroom are bored analyzing their facial expressions stated paragraph six classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored facs can then provide the teacher many ways which they can make the lesson more interesting that students can comprehend better and more fun way the last way which facs can greatly improve the teaching environment schools recognizing when student depressed sad facs can detect facial expressions students faces and determine they may going through trouble are depressed stated paragraph six most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication facs could recognize when student not okay that teachers can the help those students who may need help wether that emotional help help with school work facs could even help save lifes getting help students who may contemplating suicide conclusion the facial action coding system can extremely valuable schools all around the world this computer system can help teachers improve the way they teach their classrooms analyzing students emotional expressions towards certain lesson can help teachers modifying their lessons sich way that students are not bored confused lastly can help teachers know which students may going through hard times and help those who need help,5
the electoral college outdated system voting there are few weak reasons why should carried out the nations voting process the united states america should change election popular vote for the presidency admittedly the winner take all system fair way dividing the votes the first article what the electoral college the office the federal register the author asserts most states have winner take all system that awards all the electors the winning presidential candidate presidential candidate spends alot time effort and money campaign for swing state should awarded all the votes for winning that state high risk but high reward spend all that time and money only earn sixty percent the votes that why winner take all crucial add the author the first article mentions each candidate running for president your state has his her own group electors the electors are generally chosen the candidate political party but state laws vary how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are this saying that candidate chooses his her electors and you vote for the electors then choose the candidate you voted for however the people should have the right directly choose the candidate his her choice therefore the electoral college outdated and must eliminated start off bradford plumer the author the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong states under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president every vote counts but why make vote more powerful than another citizens shouldn given special vote just because they were chosen the candidates party additionally plumer explains you lived texas for instance and wanted vote for john kerry you vote for slate democratic electors pledged kerry why should kerry earn electoral votes should earn the amount voters that state persuaded vote for him should not earn the electoral votes all the people that did not think was the best presidential candidate every vote should count and that why the electoral college should eliminated secondly plumer claims perhaps most worrying the prospect tie the electoral vote that case the election would thrown the house representatives where state delegations vote the president the senate would choose the vice president because each state casts only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing voters would have much say the representatives from california who represent million voters this method ridiculous state with one representative should not have the equal amount power state with popular vote made the way electing then the odds tie would nearly impossible also plumer adds gore thanks the quirks the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency this means more people thought was better suited the president the united states but bush won because the quirks the electoral college all all the electoral college unfair and creates more problems then popular vote the united states america should change from the electoral college popular vote the outcome would better for the country and fairer the candidates that why the electoral college should eliminated,5
have you ever thought about what life would like didn have drive wouldbe pretty surprising right people all around the world wouldn have waste time learning how drive because the cars would already know how the drive themselves this would amazing how would you feel about car driving you everywhere the future will truly special someday there are many discoveries driverless cars that have been made throughout history for instants google discovered cars that could drive themselves under certain circumstances since the cofounder google named sergey brin believes that the cars would fundamentally change the world many ways even though the cars aren all the way driverless they can still help actual drivers when they are the car alerting them issues when driving there has also there had been smart road that have worked amazingly well who say the driverless cars won google had even modified different cars where there are sensors video camera the rearview mirror gps receivers motion sensors and many different other things help the driverless cars mimic the skills actual human wheel the different sensors have progressed time they can detect and react the dangerous skids and rollovers that can happen while the road the sensors can also inform drivers when they need use the brakes making safer for people and other drivers around them although you may think the cars are all driverless they still need the help human drivers drivers can help navigate through varies work zones and avoid accidents around them this requires that pople must albret when they are the car all times there are also vibrators the seat that alert the drivers they are too close another car when they are backing too the manufactures are also looking into different types camera that help the car watch the driver even the driver watching the road that great these driverless cars are really amazing there are different things that help them makes the roads and human drivers drive safely the idea having car that can drive self wonderful this can truly help the world better place the future that yet come,4
students can dificult understand some times and you may not know how they are feeling weather thats happy sad angry confused now there techonology called facial action coding system that enables computers indentify human emotions and can used for many different purposes one way that has been introduces use letting teachers use read students emotions think used class room settings schools and for students would very valuable their education for instance say student not under standing the concept the lesson the teacher teaching the facial action coding system will able detect that the student confused and the teacher can see that and back and explain again they can work one one with the student another way could helpful student isn being their usual self and isn focusing their work the facial action coding system can tell you they are feeling sad angry and the teacher can confront the student about and maybe help them with that problem they can get back being focused class the facial action coding system can also tell emotions are being faked they are real can this using little bit anatomy looking which muscles are being used the persons face real smile the muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palabras make crow feet around your eyes but fake smile the mouth stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and the pistorius this can seen sometimes without facs facial action coding system that can used situations like for say student seems like they are doing fine with the material being taught class just seems happy but the teacher can tell they can use the facial action coding system technology determine whether they should confront the student about not teacher understands what their students are feeling they can change their teaching methods needed help their students succeed class some times the student may just bored the subject and may because the way the teacher teaching but the teacher knows that they can spice bit make the material more enjoyable for that student learn think the use the facial action coding system would very valuable class rooms not for just the teacher but also for the students because the teacher will able curve the way they things for the better the students education this will also help the teacher build healthy relationship between their students because they will able better understand them the more the teacher better understands their students the more they can help them recieve great education,4
the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit because venus interesting helpful and safe the passage tells about how the planet venus can improve and useful venus could dangerous but there are many more reasons that venus good opportunity research there are many new discoveries not yet found there are many interesting things about venus first all venus the second planet from our sun paragraph states venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too second all venus atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the conditions are far more extreme than what human encountered third all venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system there might additional volcanoes and powerful earthquakes last all venus called the evening star venus helpful planet because its characteristics first all often venus refered earths twin stating that its saying that the planet venus just like the planet earth second all venus the same earth then would possible for people visit and see the place paragraph states that thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus third all has higher carbon dioxide helpful for last all venus might useful someday the future the planet venus safe place because all the facts that stated the passage first all earth safe place for then venus would too even the astronomers are fascinated how much both the planets are alike second all venus could someday our second home place where can visit the passage states furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel third all venus safe because the nasa has been doing experiments and testing stuffs nasa has been experimenting with inventions last all scientists even seek conduct thorough mission about venus doing that scientists can understand more about the planet conclusion venus interesting helpful amd safe venus has been tested out and has been experimented the experiments people can tell whether its safe not after finishing the passage venus environment which everyone would enjoy,3
recently many countries around the world there have been actions made towards the reduction complete banishment most automobiles order help advance society paris there was law enacted forcing drivers leave their cars home every other day majority the reasoning behind such ban was the pollution that were constantly emitted into the atmosphere this not only accepted the general public but some even say that their stress was much lower than with automobiles daily life the people who give their vehicles live vauban germany report having less estess than when they did use cars daily transportation stated heidrun walter media trainer who lives vauban when had car was always tense much happier this way this experimental surburban community places park car are forbidden most areas they far rid all driveways and parking lots the community this cerastes more spaces businesses operate causing all stores built closer households this turn makes getting and from places faster and safer the people paris also prefer the decreased amount vehicles during rush hour which alleviates their stress tremendously when navigating the city this has affected less major cities also such bogota their annual car free day has lead the construction over miles bicycle paths which the longest amount any latin country not only that but other recreational activity centers have also emerged throughout the city according the mayor bogota pollution has had large impact large car intensified cities like paris which was some points comparable places with the most pollution the smog eventually resided but some aspects the ban still remained the cars there typically use diesel over gasoline due tax policies that prefer specifically thus about two thirds the vehicles france prefer diesel engines which are blame for the smog that engulfed paris according the new york times passenger cars europe are responsible for twelve percent the total greenhouse emissions the percentage the united states over four times that some congested areas the cities paris vauban and bogota are few the many global areas that have taken the challenge removing cars from their daily lives which has benefited both their health and their environment this part the long term shift our societies way commuting from one place another the amount people going get driver licenses has been decline since the united states and projected the continue that path for long time fact there was twenty three percent decrease young poeple driving form people are leading seeing the benefits decreasing the use cars and the amount traffic only going keep decreasing local businessman bogota said good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution,4
position that self driving cars should manufactured and eventually should sold the general public the cars wouldn fix all the problems that come along with cas accidents and problems but can help reduce them the reason why self driving cars should manufactured because can stop help prevent less accidents from happening theres less people the car then there are less people get hurt and the car driving going safe have the car drive its self because its programed make the best decision keep the passenger others safe bmw making car with car safety feature reduce the use cellphones being used while behind the wheel california nevada florida and the district columbia have all allowed limited use semi autonomous cars companies and people wouldn want make buy the cars they weren proven safe possible also said paragraph that they have cars that auto lock the breaks make safer self driving cars could also reduce the percentage dui related car accidents and deaths having the car drive for you instead anyone risking getting put jail getting pulled over paragraph also says that the cars will have lot sensors them detect any obstacles and for the car aware its surroundings all times conclusion think that self driving cars should made because they can help better the world and the future ahead reducing the percentage accidents and problems that human drivers put themselves risk,2
driverless cars are coming the article driverless cars are coming presents both positive and negative aspects these driverless cars think that driverless cars are useless don see whats the point driverless cars the future assume that mostly everyone will driving driverless car because now days people are really lazy the author the reticle said believes such cars would fundamentally change the world believe that well know that giving this world more technology everything going different its not going the same anymore don seem get why even driverless cars are invented driverless cars are for people who are lazy and mostly how the world now mostly some are lazy some people don really care about anything anymore because they are always going think about how there always going something new that invented help them out like for example believe that driverless cars should requested for old people old people want around but some don know how drive and some don even have strength much energy around but see how everyone wants the easy way out now days its just confusing like what has happened our generation all these kids with techonology back when were their age didn even know what was going back then people would invent something very often and now since have technology the inventors want add more and more what are all addicted already therefore driverless cars are useless they are not worth they aren dangerous but they aren that safe either takes its risks because you are letting machine drive for you not you you control the machine you can your ways what you like and more safe because you would have control everything like said back the article presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times agree that the only safe car has human driver control all times don plan buying myself driverless car they ever come out don plan getting one letting anyone family memebers get one just think they are dumb even though haven yet seen one tried out not the type people when they see something knew just people everyone has they want just myself but beleive our world going bad the future like look how are today just imagine the future bet are all going end looking like robots,3
most people can live without there car but vauban germany street parking driveways and home garages are completely car free experts say that tis huge impediment current efforts reduces greenhouse gas emission only transport people have there bikes walking buses they seem like this way better then taking car back and forth thoughtout the day paris has also taking part this after days near pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city people were ordered leave there cars home not will fined congestion went down percent the captial france when people left there cars home exceptions were madd were they allowed people use plug cars and cars carring more passengers eventually the smog cleared out maybe not using your cars all the time might good thing another interesting thing bogota colombia colombians hiked biked skated took buses work during car free day leaving streets eerily devoid traffic jams most colombians said that its good opportunity take adays stress and lower air pollution with people not really using there cars anymore parks and ports centers bloomed and rush our restrictions have dramatically cut traffic america president obama ambitious goals curb the united states greenhouse gas emission studies have shown that fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licences each year goes maybe fiving less and really taking buses taxis walking and riding bikes really good way get around instead driving car all the time buying gas and polluting air maybe better for the world,1
the topic keeping changing the electoral college has beeen around for quite some time some may argue that unfair way vote for presidency although some may think otherwise the electoral college provides different opportunities for other political members well the common people this voting method you are able trust each member running they are for people who wants express himself politically and that balances political weight throughout the electoral college requires candidates that are trustworthy not only others but everyone was said excerpt from slate magazine that each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the party nominee this basically means that get choose which candidate that can trust with more big political problems this shows that will heard through these electors that know can trust although different cases this might become democratic problem from are not able speak personally atleast know how they will manage and work the elections properly different people have different perspectives several things especially when comes politics political places need the different views other people able make non biased decision they want see how others feel and think about different situations keeping the electoral college will able express our different political references the defense the electoral college was stated that voters presidential elections are people who want express political reference defense the electoral college people who were vote are the same people who wants express how they feel about one thing the people who vote might feel strongly about political situation than others stated paragraph fifteen that this may become problem for not democratic way although argue the people living the country city has the equal amount chance hearted and represented talented intelligent and trustworthy people the process the electoral college provides even political balance throughout nation stated posner conducting the process the electoral college will create more homogeneous region throughout the country will get the same equal rights and chances well people across the nation political balance hard keep withing big state although large states can simmered down with electoral college does not only that for large states but also help the even smaller states electoral college has been efficient way that has been around for years select representatives each state that may have bigger chance politics the future the people one country are able get our voices heard thoughtout the world the electoral college contains people who you are able trust the people who can express their political views very clearly and that provides political balance throughout,3
the use technology read emotional expression students classroom not valuable its not valuable read classmates emotions because its pointless plus that were the case should already able read minds the text states cant actually calculate their emotions meaning possible but there purpose for and its weird the creators point vew the technology could give the wrong sign expression the text also states the facial expression for each them are universal meaning that everyone titled their own emotion why would you want tamper with for reason don think would reasonable for anything conclusion the technology read expressions students are not valuable more like pointless useless every person has their own expressions and emotions thats more like invading their privacy you ask you can simply lokmat the person face tell what kind expression emotions she feeling,2
classrooms this time period are filled with high tech computers and new innovations that are useful teachers and students seems like every month something new added classrooms that can help stimulate learning some these new inventions are something that one would ever imagined that what makes them appealing and why people grab them off shelves the first chance they can this technology you can quite grab off the shelves but something that worth installing this new software facial action coding system facs relays facial muscles identify what emotions someone feeling one can only imagine all the different possibilities someone could have with this software but major possibility installing classrooms this technology would useful have classrooms because can advance learning prevent bullying and help identify mental disorders there are countless times when one starts daze and daydream instead paying attention the classroom daydreaming just much better then having teacher talk about spectator ions and how iconic compounds can net not however this new technology facs could very useful the classroom for this reason the reason being that can advance learning like never would thought this computer would have the ability stimulate lessons that would keep kids entertained and focused turn they would more likely learn more and retain the knowledge classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored alto this computer sensed that the child was becoming unfocused could something about unlike teachers who sometimes don always catch when student falling asleep daydreaming however this computer would know and could fix the issue right away the child would learning throughout the day since the computer keeps the child focused and learning for longer amount time the child would have the ability become more intelligent because would spending more time learning this could lead all different sorts opportunities for the child like special education programs scholarships etc bullying serious issue can sometimes hard spot and solve and matter how hard people try never goes away always there the hallways some schools lurking over some and haunting them yet what there was way reduce bullying big way well now there with the help the facs facs could reduce bullying because would able identify for extended period time child was feeling sad and scared then teacher would know something weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions alto since this software can recognize mixed emptions would able tell child was showing the side effects being bullied recognizing that child being bullied would help the child because they could talk adult and hopefully the problem would solved also bullies knew that this software was schools then they would less likely bully because there would greater likeliness them being caught overall lower levels bullying would result higher self esteem and confidence which then can reflected academics everyday kids walk through the halls school and feel like they are totally alone how they feel they feel like they will have live the rest their lives feeling the way they and they become hopeless this effects their academics because they are less focused and might not care how they school however facs was installed schools maybe kids could get the help they need for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply looking her face alto some cases this quote might true however when comes having mental disorder most friends can just guess how their friend feeling this where facs would come into play this system would able know how child feeling and then those emotions are typically out the range what normal teenager might feeling they could sent professional this professional could then diagnose the teenager whose been feeling this way and possibly have therapy overall they would help them they will feel better after all this done and the teenager starts feeling better and being able focus school their academics could skyrocket with all the new inventions and innovations that have been becoming known society throughout the years facs one them that could have postive affect the public and more specifically classrooms this technology would have the ability advance learning sensing when child losing interest and then change the lesson keep them entertained and continue learning could also prevent bullying knowing when child has been feeling certain way for long time and then other measures could taken help the child lastly this technology could help children with mental disorders figure out why they feel the way they and educate them about while also helping them not feel that way anymore overall this technology belongs the classroom because could solve problems that end helping teenagers academics and result opportunities advance the child further,6

why did people think that there was aliens mars there was face mars they think was made aliens and was aliens just landforms there was face mars nasa took some photos the face lot people seem think that aliens that made look like face people knew there most others living mars poeple think made made aliens other knew that was made the first humen and think look like egyptian pharoah why was there and want know who put there and how did get there did people think was aliens humen was aliens just landforms find out that was just landforms some people want aliens first humen some what knew what look like them was middle butte the snake river plain idaho other knew that was landforms what think what buch rocks that stay there for longtime here are reason there was face mars they think was made aliens and was aliens just landforms,2
against the idea driverless cars pretty much any self acting piece technology just don see safe all the concept supposed that sometime the near future there will means transportation that can think their own and travel without human aid far scientists still haven gotten that down yet the cars that are presented this passage all need human assistance because they can make their own decisions once comes the time that the driver needs put their attention the wheel they might oblivious what going the purpose that the driver supposed doing work the purpose for the car dealing with driving and far scientists havent gotten that point also people buy cars because the power luxair the certain type vehicle some people want use their skills the wheel they buy different types vehicles the way described going public means transportation and most people want their own vehicle this stage the driverless cars concept they aren really safe all once there road block construction site the driver must take control the wheel again and during that time the driver could have dazed off isn paying attention then serious accident could occur also states paragraph the vehicle slides icy road whatever the reason slid the car has knowledge how regain its stability only designed from point pint the cars aren designed for random abstraction path another thing that since these cars that still need assistance have vibrating chairs cars that have sounds and flashing lights that can problem mechanically because thats just another thing that can brake the car then others accident like stated paragraph would hard find out who fault the accident was then theres huge insurance dispute the driver liable not all together really dont belive that driverless cars driverless transportation good idea there just still too many flaws with this concept against the driverless car movement,4
from lukes point view saying that wanted people join participate that the begging the story said that luke was working grocery store and bank his friend named don resit invited him europe cattle boat luke said yes because knew was opportunity lifetime world war was over europe and lot countries were left ruins that sentence can tell you that you participated you could help fix countries nations joined together form the united nations relief and rehabilitation august they received their orders report new orleans they arrived there august luke was when arrived greece took about two weeks cross the atlantic ocean when luke was helping out his aunt katies farm had prepared him for hard work luke also found time have fun board especially return trips after the animals had been housed luke did lot things his free time like table tennis tournaments fining boxing reading whittling and games also helped pass the time but being seagoing cowboy was much more than adventure for luke bomberger opened the world him lead his family host number international students and exchanged visitors for many years luke bomberger crossed the atlantic ocean times and the pacific ocean twice help people affected world war think that from lukes point view might have wanted people participate the seagoing cowboys because might nice help our countries and support and also help others around the world who needs help that what think coming from luke bomberger point vew,2
twenty five years ago strange image was projected onto the monitors mission controllers while the viking was taking photos possible landing places for its sister ship viking what looked like alien face had appeared mission controllers back nasa must have been surprised see this but scientists were quick say that was just another martian mesa common around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows make look like egyptian pharaoh soon the pictures were released there were mixed reactions some agreed with the scientists and their research saying that the rock formation was just common mesa but some were skeptical conspiracy theorists believed that this rock was actually artifact saying that nasa was hiding extra infomation about this formation and comparing common mesa the viking photograph does make resemble face but later pictures denote this evidence the shadows are still visible but there concrete proof that this alien artifact the photo taken with camera greater resolution than the and photos further proves point the photo you can faintly see the shadows the face but they are almost nonexistent conclusion scientists research proves that this merely rock formation the photo could only prove that the formation exists and the shadows could because bad quality cameras just luck how the lighting was when the photo was taken the later photos are more accurate because our increase technology therefore being our number one source for finding out the truth aliens not exist far know and scientists continue prove that theory with updated technology,3
the future computers might able respond how you feel thanks new computer software that can now determine your emotions might just happen feel that this software could very useful for students and teachers think that facial action coding systems could useful for students because the computer could read your emotions and make changes just like real teacher for example the passage says classroom computer could recognize when student feeling confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this means that computer lesson could change the computer determined that you were bored could also explain more fully determined you were confused this software could very useful school computers facial action coding systems could also help teachers showing how the kids are feeling the software could alert teachers student was confused upset bored ect the passage says eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness suprise anger disgust fear and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements the facial muscles this means that the software accurate and could help teachers determine how kid feeling this could help teachers because the teacher could then react how the kid feeling kid was sad the teacher could comfort them and the kid was mad the teacher could talk with them this could help teachers out very much and could decrease school violence facial action coding systems could very useful students and teachers could help students that are taking online classes because the computer could respond like actual teacher this software could help teachers showing the kids emotions then the teacher could react how the student feeling for these reasons think facial action coding systems could very useful teachers and students schools,3
there are some undeniable advantages not driving car there the obvious advantage that cuts down gas emmissions that harm the enviroment during time when the enviroment needs all the help can get but there also the advantage getting fresh air and getting excessive which beneficial country like the united staes which leads the world obesity driving less also cuts down money spent gas leaving room for more disposable income also cuts down traffic and could lead peope being less frustrated tired during their day day work week you spend hour less traffic and spend that hour home relaxing you most likely tend less tired the benefits not driving car much are undeniable these benefits have led cities like paris have days that alternate when specified drivers can drive and bogota columbia they have entire day where the captial cities does not drive and one will fined they drive while you may never able replace the convenience cars the alternate forms transportation such biking bus subway have things that personal vehicles simply can not offered,2
the role car plays the life individual has made changes through out the years there never was significant meaning having car just meant having vehicle that can get you from point point the human society continues progress with the creations technology the use cars has diminished greatly different parts the world not being able use car seems like there bright side but there are actually many advantages limiting car usage the united states always had this recognition being one the world prime car cultures the first model cars were born the has also been the place where wilson pickett immortalized mustang sally president barack obama identifies the article the end car culture his dreams for the curb the united state geen house gass emissions will get fortuitous assist from incipient shift american behavior going back the article reference studies show americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses each year goes april the number miles driven per person was nearly percent below the peak there was also drop percent year olds getting license the cause the downfall car usage can pointed towards few factors internet making telecommuting possible the renewal center cities and the rise cellphones and car pooling apps not because society assumes cars are becoming use the role technological improvements are making things lot easier than how things were the the united states has the option using cars not other places like paris the option drive has become choice made out person own power paris france location that anyone dreams visiting the city beautiful but the levels smog have made impossible for people enjoy the views the city according the article paris bans driving due smog has been enforced the citizens partial driving ban order clear the air people were ordered leave their cars home suffer euro fine which the united states the way things are organized paris goes person license plate number correlation the article congestion was down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog however not all the cars used paris france were banned those cars that are plug ins hybrids and cars carrying three more passengers were allowed roam the street paris good majority percent vehicles france are made diesel and that kind fuel were the ones blame since gasoline was not favor city like that one the same way places like bogota colombia had similar situations the peole that live france the country colombia there has been day dedicated doing things with car car free day contrast how banning driving paris bogota colombia has everyone participate this hour event person were violate the rule they are face fines the article car free day spinning into big hit bogota explains that millions colombians hike bike skate take buses work during the car free day just like the goals paris colombia has goals promote alternative transportation and reduce smog businessman carlos arturo plaza explains good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution one would everything that driving stressful going work when put into mind things begin make sense the early mornings road rage people encounter makes their entire day little more stressful than what should driving wonderful advantage but there always more than just car colombia main goal expressed the article promote alternative transportation and reduce smog the end all cars have always been the making trying find new ways improve and modernize although cars may have had significant meanings the older times society continues prosper technological making cars are beginning identified material objects that are not important they are just use for people get from one place the next when other things are not working,5
yes think that using this technology could very useful for almost all grade levels schools get bored zone out and even just stop caring about lesson school simply because just bored this new software does what said can and will the article then this huge technological advancement for our education and learning all kids learn different ways and have different ways that they see things the new software can personalize the learning every student then schools wouldnt have problems with kids because they want learn grades and test scores would and less trouble would happening school huang and his colleagues can develop this emotion software and emotion science even more then the world could have bright future ahead lot smarter generations are coming through but would have mastered first because everyone has different face and everyone reacts differently feel like would quite task get every single emotion down see how particular person feeling,2
the challenge exploring venus about the idea that venus worth studying despite the dangers the planet venus the seconded planet from the son making close earth acording the author venus was often referred earth twins acording the text states venus the closest planet earth terms density and size the author also states that venus has proved very challenging place examine close for many reason like thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide even more challenging reasons clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere and temperatures over degrees fahrenheit are just some the reasons that would hard explore venus the author mainly just states the reasons its hard vitit venus and the author really doesnt state why would worthy and study venus except for samples rocks and gases conclusion wouldnt that worthy visit venus its just risky and waste time instead could study other planets like mars which already know alot about,2

the face was created aliens then their would civilization the planet long before even that could really thrilling that however not true the face that mars mesa because reasearch and pictures where canalized matches our natural landforms and their are multiple cydonia each these prove that not made aliens cool that would more into depth will talk about the pictures and research our landforms and the multiple cydonia first off the face mars mesa thanks the pictures that where canalized could also pose butte like the one snake river plain idaho the text states that what each picture actually shows the martian equivalent mesa buttle just shows how much just one picture can prove second this looks like just another one our landforms like had said before like the middle butte snake river plain the text states that thousands web surfers waiting when the image was revealed the jpl website appearing natural landform thousands people had saw landform appear how you not see that like the ones earth finally cydonia their are already multiple mesas the only difference that this one more face like the article says was just another martian mesa common aronda cydonia only this one had unusual shadows around nasa had done research see about other landforms and they have proven that their are more than one the plane then must true most people say the face bona fide evidence mars evidence that nasa would rather hide however why would nasa want ruin their entire budget saying that their was civilization mars begin with these three points landforms pictures and the multiple mesas should show that the face really not martian creation,4
new type technology was invented called facil action coding system this enables computers identify human emotions have major muscles our face and using computer model will help the computer better see your emotions belived that using computer codes help see emotions can help school could also help with our personal life psychologist paul eckman creator facs had six major emotions movement one more muscles called action unit the six major emotions are happy surprise anger disgust fear and sadnesses when you are feeling sad your face muscles change and when the computer see that change they know are feeling sad when you are the computer and your computer knows that you dont like will change something different classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored this can help the teacher helping students pick the pace students dont get bored confused and most communication non verbal and emotions this technology can also help with our personal life well school can usually see one our friend happy sad this every day why need computer this for well dont know the person mugshot say something wrong and with the help technology can better understand making the little move how you feel can change your emotion the theory emotions states that just smiling makes you happy and changes your whole mood drama coach says had actors reproduce smiling and frowning way cresting these emotions stage emotions have way changing techology helps grow and help,3
the face mars just natural landform was not created aliens was created aliens then the discovery would benefit nasa can help you understand why just landform and not alien artifact the face was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows make look like face eighteen years after the face was discovered sent michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team take picture ten times sharper the face the picture was revealed that was just natural landform there was alien monument after all later there was second picture taken close even more than before there were signs alien existence around the landform after looking all the pictures taken and research found can conclude that there was alien monument begin with like said was just another natural landform has you understanding about the face changed,2

the facs facial action coding system has good and essential uses the facs could used identify what emotion the painting drawing has for example the mona lisa painting could great example why use this system believe that the use this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom could valuable way the students can learning way where the lesson will have their attention interesting them agree that the facs could help classroom with students and maybe even improve their way learning the computer could see what facial expression the student has the computer realizes the student gets bored then might boost itself that the lesson can become interesting the child read the text called making mona lisa smile understood the point the author was making classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts highly think there would change the academic learning environment according the passage most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication meaning that the computers would also have understand what the feeling without actually communicating with the person overall agree with using the facs classroom with students classroom help the students and the learning environment the computer system would read and determine what the emotion detecting how the muscles are behaving meaning that most the muscles are rest then the emotion would most likely resting face the professors are right abot their prediction then would see somewhat change,3
dear state senator very much think that the voting the president should changed popular vote rather than the electoral college there too many things that can wrong with electoral college popular vote taking place solves many problems for example the electoral college does have vote for the president they were chose for and tie could end happening because the votes are even many important people the government have tried abolish the electoral college times including richard nixon jimmy carter and bob dole there many flaws within the electoral college like gore won the popular vote but then lost the electoral vote this government based what the people want then popular vote should far appointed over the electoral college tie could been very possible voters ohio would voted opposite and would voted opposite there would been complete disaster the election people the biggest media states didnt get see any campaign adds also voters states didnt even see the candidates all some people feel that there was popular voting for the president there would many disputes but this democracy and the government ran the people then the popular vote far better than the electoral college all all popular vote just the better way what the people want and there wont any questions asked about the outcome the election,2
the developement driverless cars unrealistic many different ways due the fact that just one car will need incredible amount technology keep the car itself safe possible means that the car will overly priced not only will over priced but the fact that people are going through much money make car that able auto pilot shows laziness brand new average car could cost about dollars when they add technology ensure the saftey the driver and everyone the car the prices cars will become too expensive for most people for starters they need whole lot sensors google modified toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounties near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and intertidal motion sensor people will begin realize that would only availabe wealthier people who can pay for extremly expensive car that will only benefit them one way them being able have transportation their own that they not have control means that they would more than likely not paying attention the road the idea having vehicle that you not have manage while the roads sounds amazing everyone what happens when one two the sensors corrupt and the car steers off into the other lane what the motion sensor malfunctions while backing out driveway and pedestrian taking jog and doesn see the car backing out there way that the driverless car could safe all times dangerous even think about how the car could have mind its own while the highway the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer transporting from place place thought having put your foot the gas making sure you remember put your turning signals sounds like great and easy way places once the driverless car has been out for years and people begin start using them often the community will get lazy and irresponsible one will ever think they will have drive themselves because they think that the cars will last forever and that they will just get better from the start theyre wrong the car could end having difficulties after few years and they will shut down the production the cars and people will too lazy drive themselves around people will end being dependent the cars all the hard work for them essence the developement driverless cars unreliable and should not proceded with the technology will raise the prices the cars and make impossible purchase without problem too much risk for wrecks happen due failing sensors and people will begin rely the car after awhile put end driverless cars and lets just stick with the ones have now,4
professors thomas huang and nicu sebe collaborated develop unique method determining human emotions using computer algorithms after process modelling and calculations muscle movements emotion face can determined with the help vinci depiction the human anatomy used the facs facial action coding system algorithms however the main picture hand whether not this highly sophisticated program necessary all the real world especially school classroom the enabling computers able identify human emotion can fact used classrooms and can great benefit the student and other people the area firstly according huang when classroom computer recognizes their facial expression that student may not very interested the lesson seems utterly confused the computer can modify its lesson and perhaps recommend the student other lessons that may more beneficial this turn can give the student the luxury exiting their state confusion and begin understand lessons and topics that was not well introduced the teacher additionally this could impact the student grade and boost greatly all with the help some complex algorithms addition the aforementioned about lesson modification computers can also detect your emotion and influence different types ads that can pop the screen for example the computer recognizes student has happy face for particular more similar can pop keep your emotion however the computer recognizes that the student emotion sad the next will different potentially more optimistic order influence different emotion the student thirdly just making facial expressions the computer whether real fake can have multiple influences other people the area constantin stanislavsky drama coach had his actors smile and frown certain way create emotion the stage and for the audience relation the facs when student for instance testing their emotions the computer screen person may look and notice his classmate frowning the screen and turn have similar effect them just making simple facial expressions can effect another person and influence their emotional status too conclusion the input emotion recognizing computers throughout school can have multitude effects student and the people around him her these include having very own built instructor the computer which can guide the student through course lessons not effectively explained their teacher advertisements shown the web that can change itself based recognition certain facial expressions and all all influence the emotional status people around the student the input the facs program can have positive impact personal relations with other people and can even help give grade booster,4
the article making mona lisa smile the author describes how new technology called the facial action coding system facs enables computers identify human emotions the paragraph below will explaining why believe the technology presented this article would valuable reading the emotional expressions students classroom first believe that the use this technology valuable used for reading the emotional expressions students classroom because like the article states could used correctly determine when student becoming confused bored this could lead modified lessons that engage and more effectively teach students the material without the need for much individual attention from the teacher also connecting last statement this technology may not only aid the students learning but also provide help teachers this because with technology that can read the students emotions and possibly adapt lessons the individual the teacher the room won have worry about giving all the students their own individual attention help them most effectively learn the same material with only small amount time this technology would almost like having dozen assistant teachers the room leaving more time for the real teacher attend things like making lesson plans and grading last but not least feel that this technology would useful the classroom because child was sad hurting depressed any other negative emotion and the student was hiding all that through smile the technology may able help see behind the smile that teachers therapists can better help students through their problems and understand them better without spending much time reading childs confusing signals conclusion believe that the facial action coding system can valuable tool the classroom for variety reasons including but not limited the reasons described the above paragraphs,3
know that very debatable question but the face wasn made aliens but simply just natural landform you don believe then can give you few facts that should justify answer and these are not just opinions they are indeed facts the first clue why the face just natural landform that april the mars global surveyor flew over mars with micheal malin and his mars orbiter camera line seven states that after the photos were taken and posted online fore people see all the pictures revealed was natural landform with alien markings what ever another reason that april nasa had once again sent their mars global surveyor into space get even closer look the face account many people didn believe that was just natural landform the camera that they used take the pictures with made each pixel the photos span from meters said line ten even after they had taken the photos again witha more advanced camera the images only showed what resembled butte mesa stated line and once again evidence alien markings those are the two reasons why the face only natural landform and not alien monument nasa has taken pictures two times already and even with more upgraded camera they still didn find evidence that aliens ever created,3
driverless cars have been argued and talked about for years there are many aspects that make the driverless car seem irresistable however there are few concerns about driverless cars that are completely understandable driverless cars are positive asset for this country these cars will shape our future and change our world for the better there have been many bumps the road for the developement driverless cars this will not deter the developers though and many people are still working them today not only will they help form our future they will help improve the present currently only few companies are working driverless cars some these companies include general motors google and bmw the birth driverless cars started with special tracks that the cars could drive the late general motors worked car that would run certain road this road sent radio signals the car itself and this how the car would drive this supported the idea that didn need smarter car needed smarted road this system worked incredibly well however this idea was too expensive after the reality special tracks failed engineers started working smarter cars this created problem first because the technology was not yet advanced enough create driverless cars bmw had developed car that could handle driving twenty five miles per hour the driver still had pay attention drive occasionally and the car wasn perfect google had been working car that could drive itself since the reading talks about how the technology create driverless cars was not there sebastian thrun founder the google car project mentions there was way before make something interesting refering the driverless cars the cars made were suprisingly successful however the cars were not one hundred percent driverless the google cars still needed driver that could take over certain conditions this brought the arguement would people want driverless car that they had drive however few years the technology should able make these cars almost completely driverless the argument allowing driverless cars going there are many facts that make using driverless car seem like good idea one the facts that support the driverless car that using driverless cars would use half the fuel today taxi system this means would save more money and save the planet the exact same time the driverless car would have more flexibility than bus well you would call the car your house and then let take you wherever you needed driverless car would allow for shorter travel times because the driver would able take breaks this would result the driver arriving places quicker driverless cars would decrease the amount crashes well these cars would eliminate human error while driving stop lights would not run and police wouldn have chase after cars because they would have the speed limit this would cause the crime rate down well the last thing needed have driverless cars the road making legal more states passage from the reading states california nevada florida and the district colombia have led the country allowing limited use semi autonomous car the cars driven these states have been relatively sucessful the rest the country should use this example and consider allowing driverless cars driverless cars are idea the future however that future closer than many believe these cars will limit gas reduce crime rate and decrease travel time driverless cars are incredibly brilliant idea for america and soon the whole planet the technology will soon allow for completely driverless cars this will improve the world driverless cars are positive asset for this country hopefully driverless cars will incorporated daily life soon conclusion instead stressing out about driving people will able sit back and let the car drive,3

the facial action coding system should not use classroom anywhere not good know how everyone feels about each others because know how feel about each other will all hate each other even for computer not good know how humans feels about the other human only polices should have this device because the polices cough bad guys they will use them according prof thomas huang this device can recognize the subtle facial movements humans use express how humans feel however this device still not trust worthy because this device did not tell the truth every would hate each other computer that knows when you happy sad not good for humans for example this facial action coding system could use humans kids will not have school anymore because they will start doing something else the facial action coding system should not use anywhere,2
now today going disprove your statement that aliens created the face steenson the red planet mars the first thing that you have wrong that the face seen mars alien origin the face that you see the picture just oddly shaped martian mesa fact there are very common that region mars for all know there could very well more oddly shaped mesas that area the fact that you miss read the caption the picture didn even look all you would you should have seen the caption stating that the reason resembles human head because the shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth the only reason the let people see that photo because they wanted more people interested more mars plus april nasa reveled everyone their website the face was early oddly sapped natural landform conclusion there are several ways that could disprove your statement the first being that just mesa which dosen have distinct form which means that another one forms could very well dog cat the second being that you may have just miss read not have read the caption which clearly states that the reason the face looks like that because the shadows and thats why has mouth nose and eyes those are just two major reasons know defiantly natural landform and not alien made face,3
many people think that the face are created aliens myself thinking dont think aliens are real this face from mars natural form from earth still researching the real idea what may have came from the pass years also many says may reflected shadow from something other scientist conclude that may just rocks hug formation which resembles human head formed shadows dust giving illusion eyes nose and mouth they called the face mars most the communication started hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkouts for years think theres just rock with holes the looking like human face but one will never know til someone takes the trip find out many think was aliens creating people just assumed that idea other scientist still today wonder what really how was really created there may have been ancient civilization mars years ago thousands anxious web surfers were waiting for research post better and good viewer the face mars thinking revealing alot research taking pictures and not approving that the face isnt changed the amount days and years that may just natural landform and that theres aliens monument after all there will still other thinking and having their own opinions about the face mars everyone wont just satisfied with one fact option about the face still many and most scientist are till snapping camera shots the face and posting them the web more and more people and scientist will have different thoughts about and the world will never know what going and what really until someone actually observed face face opinion think wasting time doing research something little that have been lasting for years one never had the time really observe the reality about the face doing this research and conclude things will never tell the people answers about what the face,2
welcome name bianca scientist nasa many you may know about the strange face mars and how there are countless rumors about the famous being natural landform bona fide evidence life mars while scientists belive and have configured fact natural landform skeptics just not agree however may when the photo was snapped scientists figured was just another martian mesa since was common around cydonia just this reticular one had unusual shadows that make look like egyptian pharaoh when nasa unveiled the image the caption noted huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving illusion facial features they said reasoned would good way engage the public and attract attention mars fact did meanwhile conspiracy theorists are just glued the fact that they think the face evidence life mars they say its evidence that nasa would rather hide than show but reality nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars although few scientists believed the face was alien artifact conspiracy theorists were driven prove was evidence life and april michael malin and his moc mars orbiter camera snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos when the image first appeared jpl web site revealed natural landform proving there was alien monument after all skeptics were still drilled the idea that bona fide evidence life mars conspiracy theorists said perhaps the alien markings were hidden haze our nasa team april the global surveyor drew close enough for second look malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo finally after all photos were taken and examined the pictured demonstrated that what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west much like most middle butte the snake river plain idaho lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars after all the face mars was actually just natural landform all rumors have cleared the air scientists have configured,4
dear state senator the electoral college has negative impact this country because has unfair voting that can cause massive problems the government electoral college unfair outdated and irrational people should have the right vote which president they think fit run this country people are hardly know which elector they are voting shouldn vote for electors that don know elections should held popular vote because elector colleges have unfair advantage since there vote counts not ours according the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong bradford plumer states faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please the fact that the congress has unfaithful electors that are supposed supporting whomever candidate they choose massive unfair problem popular votes and electors votes are the complete opposite for instance according the article defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president richard posner states happened when gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral voters but that was the first time since this unfair and confusing because the electors shouldn deciding what candidate should win the peoples vote should conclude which candidate going win since the first electoral college was created has been the same severine majorly outdated and has solved now according the article what the electoral college the office the federal register states the founding fathers established the constitution compromise between election the president vote congress and election the president popular vote qualified citizens there suppose vote from the congress and vote from the population think that the congress should part the voting that all the qualified citizens are there shouldn two different parts voting because will confuse who the winner the government should have voting system that both equally fair and decisive because right now everything mixed and will bring great problems the campaigns more and more people will want stop voting because they not trust the electors there decisions this will cause great decrease voters which will impact the populations vote which president the winner according the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong bradford plumer states the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse those electors could always defy the will the people solution must done prevent any more disasters that can there way conclusion electoral colleges have unfair system that could cause negative problems voting and the elections the elections will confusion and unprofessional but the government and the people america can help changing this and will approve fair decisive system were all citizens get choose which president shall win not the type electors sincerely student,4
many people have heard the face mars friend and were arguing about was ancient bona fide evidence life mars natural landform argued bit but finally believed after told him the real facts here evidence the face being natural landform begining with the first image ever uploaded the face many believed the face some sort alien artifact nasa stated was rock formation and this would proved over period years firstly when the picture was taken scientist thought could have been ancient artifact but then found out was just mesa but with unusual shadows give its appearance this stated all paragraph there must have been degree surprise among mission controllers back the propulsion lab when the face appeared their monitors but the sensation was short lived scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh next much better photos were taken almost years after the original image this stated this sentence photographed the face soon could get good shot and april when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera moc team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos finally final picture taken was the key finishing the research and prove was just mesa begining with each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo and also stated there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were nevertheless the controversial photo was disproven this shows how much popular photo can become question science can can not answer finally over and done with the face was actually mesa with shadow taken the perfect time show face,3
opinion dont think they can tell what peoples emotions are looking computers because everyone act different ways for example you can say just person not surprised because they didn raise their eyebrows there one way act for emotion because different people act different way you can look emotions like math homework because you can tell math right wrong but you can that with emptions because not fact for example there are some people who dont show any emption for anything can tell that they are not happy because they dont have smile their face know guy who gos school and never shows any emptions for example when gets good grade his geometry test that doesn mean anger think hard juge peoples feeling their face some people smile all the time that doesn mean they have everything perfects you can juge book cover and the same for emption book can look old and boring but when you read you might like crazy how think technology will know all this things seems technology taking over the world now think can tell are emption just looking picture person what next our life story overall don think you can tell peoples emptions technology,2
making this use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom not valuable because some students like keep their emotions themselves another reason some students have more serious face you can tell their emotions last reason people have mixed emotions some people like keep their emotions their selves because they dont want people know whats going example from the article most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication this means that some human don like communicate especially with their emotions some students have more serious face you cant tell whether their happy sad example from the passage for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face this means that you can tell when person happy sad but some people can have serious face but can really happy the inside some people have mixed emotions which means like mood swings etc example from the passage weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions this means that the person can either sad happy serious mad therefore the use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom not valuable because some students want keep their emotions their selves,3
think about this software actually big help for the schools and such see our friend bad mood then can talk them find out why think this system can actually really help but not only but our teachers well the system digs deep into our muscles and will understand our whole face will indicate actions emotions and feelings that could help our friends they are wondering why are happy mood bad mood our friends are really helpful times our friend feeling down happy about something should have the right know according huang the software can tell many things about persons mood what they are really feeling like knowing person down happy can talk them and ask what going why are you sad why are you happy the computer telling how person feeling will valuable because shows how big our technology getting and knowing that know there going something bigger than that later the future now all would wait for something bigger this software would very helpful fot our own teachers because they could take the computer get our face the computer and indicate aare bored not she does this while she teaching lesson and finds out are confused then she can change her ways teaching that lesson can actually understand and the teacher knows are happy mood then she knows understand the material atleast thats why are happy the facial acting coding system would really good thing for ned get attached our school software all together would help our friends and teachers epically the teachers because they would know what teach better would understand the material that they want learn and the system would genuine thing not only would this help with teaching and understanding but for our friends that have depression would know when there emotions are hurting when they are hurting place and could help them this software being thing people with depression never show and understand that but could atleast something about that and that helping them and being there for them,3
the face mars have you ever seen something crazy something maybe face something that you seen before have you thought about how that face something else has gotten there well for start defiantly wasn aliens just like the face mars people belive that the face was created aliens but that isn true the face mars just and only natural landform that some how was created earth for first reason why the face mars just natural landform because nasa later reveled that the face was not made aliens but shadows few days after that image was found nasa needed take look and figure out what made this incredible and scientific picture unique and why and how was formed later they have came with good explanation about this unique image nasa said this huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth scientifically the face was made from natural cause makes very different natural landform now for second reason why this was not made aliens but just natural landform that there scientific research showing that aliens exist and created this face now know that some people say that they have seen aliens but scientists dont think that one hundred percent true because they don have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real many people belive them but how know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge but now after nasa did some research they found out that even though don have information about them aliens did not create that face was only natural landform for third and final reason why the face was not created aliens and only natural landform because the last paragraph paragraph twelve they talk about how the the picture actually shows that the martian equivalent butte mesa since the landform shows butte mesa that means that the image was major landform that came from the american west garvin says reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho also said that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars this not only natural landform but major natural landform agree little bit about aliens creating the face somewhere space there are aliens that created something else not one day maybe can find something out space that has something with aliens but today just isn the day that but overall would have agree that aliens did not create this but this only natural landform created something other than aliens you can see this creative landform was most defiantly not created from aliens but just nice natural landform scientists now figured out that this face mars from shadows and not from aliens this landform actually butte mesa which very interesting have found out many people did belive that the face mars was created aliens but scientists haven found out there are aliens not shouldn jump into conclusion but overall this face was definately landform and not created aliens,5
has anyone ever thought about driverless cars and have you thought about the good and the bad about them well sure have found out lot about them and know that people have different mind set about these care because how they are set and can tell you agree with how they are set and like and here why the article about driverless cars are coming agree about have them because paragraph seven the text states that these driverless cars are made have the seats vibrate when you car danger when back another object also agree because the text says that the law focus keeping driver passangers safe they have made whole bunch sensors put cars make them safe driverless cars are excellent idea think because the text clearly states everything about the car and tells about and agree with the idea because what the law requires and howey have mad safe for people and there objects for there cars also thought was good idea because the way the they put the sensors the car,2
dear senator feel that should change using the electoral college the popular vote much more effective using the popular vote decide who becomes president would show who the citizens the united states want the popular vote shows what each state has voted for using the electoral college takes the right away for the people being able vote for the president that they favor instead using what the people voted for they come together chose the candidate they predict would the best and the most for the country and that not fair voting important this country then congress should understand that when the poeple vote for something everyone wants their decisions that makes one the two candidates become president not who the electoral college believes would best could overcome the debate between what process works better more people might vote although some citizens believe that the electoral college good idea feel that they compared not having the electoral college and only using the popular vote durning voting periods they would feel they system more effient one example big states could make tremendous impact which canidate wins the election these states have more people with more opinions that should used durning the time the election for the president some the problems with the electoral college not only voters not vote for their president back the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors with new electors who opposed john kennedy that popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone kennedy that same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please that not what are promised country states that the electoral college suppose cast vote what their state wants and what their state has chosen that year the right was taken away voting serious matter popular vote would clarify what each states popular favor who they want and which candidate their vote was casted for hope with all the information that have just provided you with above will help show you that the popular vote isn only what most people want also the better choice,4

studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents facing lot challenging things could difficult tasks complete this situation think studying venus worth our time because nasa and others are trying land the surface least stay longer the atmosphere explore the planet they can just give what they already did there moving back quitting the experiments for researching venus exploring venus could very difficult tasks because many scientists figures that venus has harsh climate and times hotter than our planet surface also the hottest surface temperature any planets our solar system even though mercury the closest the sun this evidences might prove that impossible reach venus surface but this modern date think can accomplish something plan reach venus surface much quicker than previous years because more people are getting smarter these days the venus atmosphere contains highly corrosive acid called sulfuric acid type acid that reacts with other chemicals such sodium need ship that prevents the acid from getting inside that won destroy the plane ship could make jet that passes everything such storms like lightning tornadoes and more paragraph talks about how would helpful were make jet that passes avoid any dangerous conditions the surface venus the temperature would still overheated around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close the sea level earth there would enough solar power and the radiation would not exceed earth level not easy conditions but possible for human survive possible send human venus but don think she will make back unharmed because the temperature high venus paragraph discusses about the environment venus having rocky sediment just like our planet earth not that impossible live venus right think could possible live venus after many centuries decades the planet could possibly decrease cool down the temperature the surface and could reduce acid the atmosphere figure out how destroy the acid reduce the reactants venus have landscapes like mountains craters valleys and etc why not try test observations even explore not easy figure out solve the problem will takes years might not even possible test prototypes land venus need prototype ship that avoids any destruction that doing the jet accomplish one then maybe one day can explore and learn more about venus these are the evidences and supporting details why think venus worthy our time even though dangerous,4

the world today you will see cars just about everywhere whether toyota epirus honda civic car doubly have been one the larges not the greatest inventions this world has ever seen although nowadays when start talk negatively about the car people seem turn their heads away avid the question reducing the use cars the world would massively beneficial the enviroment and not only that everyday life limiting car usage will help reduce pollution into the atmosphere through reducing carbon emmissions will help save money and also will help reduce stress and tense mindsets one the largest benefits reducing car usage the world the reduction greenhouse gases being relased the atmosphere coming out the exhaust pipes cars according german suburb life goes without cars percent greenhouse gas emissions the united states come from cars car congested areas the passage the text explains how social experiment turned into growing trend europe today suburban town vauban many people have ultimately given their cars how this was done you may ask the town driveways are forbidding aswell home garages car ownership isnt forbidden though but own car quite difficult and costly with only two places park the whole town makes ownership very difficult the lifestyle people here without cars ultimately reduced stress and increased health and much happier and healthier lifestyles were made another example will paris france after the city recieved near record breaking pollution the air paris officals took action they banned driving for two days attempt reduce carbon emissions the way they enforced this rule was fines throughout the city for cooperation that monday the first day the ban only fines were given many people were complained inconvenience and companies complained lost revenue although the insolvencies the ban for just one day reduced the smog almost completely and allowed for pairs lift the scheduled ban that tuesday even though some places the reduction car usage may cause inconvenience the reduction carbon emissions cant unnoticed and huge advantage reduction the usage cars will not only reduce greenhouse gases but will also help people conserve and save money and stay stress free limiting car usage will save you money couple ways one which not having fuel your car save money fuel prices are always moving and down but more recently they have been very high for many people they are spending over dollars the pump just dire miles with reduction car usage people wont have spend much money the pump reduction car usage will also help reduce spending money because wont allow buy things certain stores that you have drive too and things like that another advantage the reduction the usage the car the reduce stress for person town vauban heidrun walter said when had car was always tense much happier this way this way mean the way without car,4
even though venus has thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide whist survivable for humans astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like our solar system the author explains that long time ago was covered oceans valleys and mountains venus has really high temperatures such degrees fahrenheit even higher which makes the planet with the hottest surface our solar system but the author says that the nasa possible solution this float above the fray blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the surface venus these would not easy conditions but they would survivable for humans however explains this not the best way venus because could not take samples rock the surface venus study them but the nasa says that could use computers that would probably resist the high temperatures conclusion the author explains the end the last paragraph that human curiosity will help understand how survive extreme conditions other planets matter how dangerous they are,1
think that the author describes how technolgy called facial action coding system enables computer identify human emotions and expressions the students the classroom are valuable for example the begging the line imagine being able detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions catches people attention another example that the author used that was included that was good was paragraph one when states that shes percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry this shows that the author included logos his paragraph another way having valuable short third example has pathos catching peoples feelings making them think being put into someone els shoes hold can actually calculate emotions like math homework and how can computer recognize the subtle facial movements humans use express how feel the author also gave examples looking the mirror think that the author gave details examples for the student having the classroom,1
not agree with technology read students emotional expressions should used because just waste money honestly believe that teachers former students should know when someone upset angry happy mean would irrelevent for school spend thousands dollars know when someone upset teachers should able see their own students would upset schools could spend the money more important things like for textbooks gym equipment sports classrooms even build another part the school not some emotion detector but hey anything could happen paragraph states fact humans perform this same impressive calculation every day for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor how could that even work,2
its just erosion the plant there might ben metier strike those places and just looks like face might ben ator from millions years that eroded the face the plant and made look like had face but think was water mediator strike the plant and not aliens was aliens they would not sending people that plant because they would kill them orand why would aliens want place that has water and nother living things the plant its daoed plant there nothing sides dirt wand gasses and maybe just maybe some plants trees barid the dirt the plant and aliens would made bass the plant and have found nothing that sorts and they would never told uss bout that plant the first place there was aliens,1
hve you ever been argument before well going try and persuade you that the face are natural land form first will talk about the way know that the face are not created aliens something lets get now the paragraph going provide you with facts and details from the reticle why think natural land form first this really face made aliens something where the rest the body also earth nasa says that they have never seen recorded real life alien aliens did make this would the news because come how many aircrafts are sent into space day most likley about one ever day and also have satélite space and bet you countries like russia canada and probably even the british have one space and something like that happened would hope one those satelites would see that happening and for all you and now that are moon has craters right craters happen ever day could something like this happen would think and nasa also said that they did there reseach pictures taken the space shuttles and very accurate drawing the face not done consiste theros conclusion those were some best argument reason why think the face natural land form not face that was made levins thos meare reasonings what you think,2
wouldnt there see its planet would send drone something and study the fed the drone give the only reason ill there they give strong enough suit visit and splays visit the story they say its temperature hot around degrees fahrenheit its not easy condition liv they say the atmospheric pressure times greater than experience these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land its surface thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planets surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit think that person try visit venus without the necessary tools they will die from the atmosphere weather and clouds more importantly researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above fray the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters would bad idea visit the planet say that because all the tuff weather how hot and the lightning they should just leave that planet alone until they have all the tools visit the planet think they visit the planet now they would more likely die from the heat and atmosphere around the panet and the clouds around they would probably last couple hours before they die they should just stick with the research they have now and leave the planet alone,2
cars have made impression human history they have been used get from point for decades they may help but they also can hurt gas emissions are hurting the environment and smog continues grow some governments have already implemented ways reduce these emissions these have helped the problem and may even our advantage many cities have already sought out ways benefit the people that have chosen npt use their cars this limiting car usage has benefited many countries and the trend seems catching the first source elisabeth rosenthal writes that has made peope even happier than they had had car has also helped reduce traffic normally busy streets the most obvious benefit and advantage having limited car usage the fact that the reduced car use has reduced gas emissions these many advantages may make not using your car worth your while limiting car usage can beneficial the environment and can also beneficial you can make for less stressed people source describes how small town germany many people are getting along fine without motor vehicles matter fact some even said that they were happier without car heidrun walter states that when had car was always tense much happier this way may less stressful because the goverment there had designed that town that everything they could need was within walking distance could reached with public transportation many cities have already adopted this idea including new york source has also asked people their opinion and businessman carlos arturo plaza said great opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution carlos had said this while riding two seated bicycle with his wife walking hiking and even bicycling have been generally seen way distress and relax your tensions stepping away from the car and just walking may just the stress reliever you needed usual sight see busy cities and main streets the amount cars that jam the street alway the way during certain hours the day this can become increasingly annoying some people that can their way school job car free day has had very succesful turn out bogota colombia source number described the streets the capital colombia eerily devoid traffic jams that day many people might have participated because violators would fined this car free day was intentionally placed promote alternative transportations such biking public buses and also reduce smog another example type car limiting was seen paris france paris was near record amount smog the air with micrograms particulate matter per cubic meter compared with brussels and london source paris took action try and reduce smog with this simple method leave cars with even numbered license plates home face fine they proceeded the next day with the same concept but this time instead even numbered plates was odd numbered plates this reduced congestion percent the capital france one the more obvious advantages limiting car usage the amount emission that can prevented from not using your car source stated that after days limiting car usage the smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party rescuing the ban for odd numbered plates tuesday after just five days the imposed fines gas emissions into the atmosphere was reduced significantly enough lift the ban five days made such impact can also make huge impact many more people were start limiting their car usage car usage has already been falling the united states source states that new york new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities proliferation car sharing programs across the nation this talking about how all these factors have come reduce car sales and car usage general less cars equals less gas which would then equal less air pollution conclusion there are many advantages limiting your car usages you may not only helping the environment but you may also helping yourself using your car less may even make you less stressed individual has been shown reduce congestions busy streets has also helped reduce gas emission limited car usage has started trend many countries and may even trend here can give these advantages and many more,5
this passage talks about how venus challenging planet study despite its proximity humans also talks about the danger about venus surface has the hottest temperature any other planet here one reason why its dangerous but there also good reasons some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions this good because then scientists can able make those electronics and send them venus without making any those electronics stop working the author gives good reasons the passage for example the passage says scientists seeking conduct through mission understand venus would need get close and personal despite the risks this shows how researchers will work thier machines make them last loner contribute their knowledge venus another thing that the passage says nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray this explains how they will come with something avoid some dangers venus think its good idea too because the end the passage says our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation this makes think back the beginning too because says numeros factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite its proximity this makes think that its not challenging because there could people who knows some things about venus and they could try and help with the whole venus situation the scientist can maybe later then send rocketship venus because shouldn limit dangers and doubts,3
dont think should have driverless cars that haired situations because that type thing the driver not controle what ever the driver has purpose there all and can very dangerous there part because like instead the person controling the car that his life his own hands but say the car controle she will putting there life computers chip they have sure with that order for but bet the people won even care about there own life why you say because they will busy enjoying there new driverless car what perhaps the car has malfunction the passenger and hits person say kills that person what would you blame that the person the car the peron had nothing with why because she was depended their new drive less car you also have think about the legal likeability with this new found car you have have ascertain amount mature level drive regular car but driverless car thats crazy you can fall asleep the wheel kill somebody and say was not your fault you can blame the people that make these cars thats noun sence what would that family think they will still press charges you and the people that make because its they fault for the malfunction but yours fault not paying attention would madness for all plus what human skills would required for this get purchased not any you telling you would fell comfortable with baby the front seat car not surely will not feel safe aswell comfortable conclusion think that driverless cars are azides situations,3
some people think the face was created aliens you really think about just natural landform there are many reasons why just natural landform being scientist nasa important job the people nasa have many reasons why the face not alien artifact first cydonia became priority for nasa when mars global surveyor mgs arrived the red planet sept eighteen long years after the viking missions ended which had impact the face second cheif scientist for nasa mars exploration program said that they felt this was important taxpayers totally agree with him and what said would very important the taxpayers then photographed the face soon could get good shoot many people had play important role tell that nasa wasnt created aliens april when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time man named micheal malin and his mars orbiter camera moc team snapped picture ten times sharper than the orginal viking photos thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl website reveal natural landform there was alien monument after all although many people weren yet quit satisfied the camera board mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face due being winter they started think perhaps said skeptics alien markings were hidden the haze misson controllers began prepare look again not easy target cydonia says garvin fact its hard work many people still began think that the face was created aliens april cloudless day cydonia mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look had roll the spacecraft degrees center the face the field view said garvin malins team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution each pixel the images had spanned meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo the picture showed the maritana equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west many people thought that the face was created aliens but turns out was natural landform the nasa had take mant steps for them able complete this task the nasa had took many important roles find out was natural landform being scientist nasa important job,3
agree that should use the facial action coding system even told mona lisa emotion she was perecent happy perecent disgusted perecent fearful and perecent angry think that could help student beacuse some student are scared ask question and they get confused the system could help with telling our emotion and humans like tell people our emotion and you don know how you like for example sad angry you can the facial action tell you how you feel well work the computer constructs computer model the face all major muscle movement one more muscles called action unit the facial expression for each emotion are universal observes huang even though individuals often show varying degrees expression like not smiling broadly using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements the way did making happy face this experiment also make you feel slight happy according the facial feedback thero emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce,2
opinion driverless cars would extremely dangerous certain situations especially with teenagers drivers this invention could have very bad outcome cars without drivers pointless how will cars know where how get there how will they able detect when there pedestrian trying cross driving should not made easier for our community because part everyday life citizens will only become lazier and have urge motivation not only drive but all other natural things car that drives self will only make our country worse better cool when see cars driving themselves movie and television but really worth there are many pros and cons this particular topic prod are there would lower rate deaths and car related injuries because not many people would driving citizens also have think about the small percent people that could possibly driving what car without driver had malfunction and went out control think the result this situation could far more dangerous than two drivers colliding teenager working get listens and start driving cars that drive themselves are not very smart think driverless cars just another way asking for more conflict and death rates our country believe the industry trying make electronics too much like humans they are trying make these products almost impossible work and the long run lives will lost then question will what should now this was supposed work opinion technology far too advanced now then should can only imagine what will like five ten years just hope driverless cars will not the near future,3

how the nasa can studying venus introduction the challenge exploring venus the article about the venus that venus teh second planet from our sun also the nickname misleading since venus actually planet our solar system and also often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and mars our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun different speeds and also because venus sometimes right around the corner space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped wold first the challenge exploring venus say that planet venus sometimes called the evening star one the brightest points light the night sky making simple for even amateur stargazer spot also the venus have nickname that misleading since venus actually planet our solar system but venus simple see from the distant but safe vantage point earshot has proved very challenging place examine more closely secondly the national aeronautics and space administration nasa they want send humans for studying venus but the nasa say have the solution for studying venus and the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientist float above the fray and the nasa say imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above teh roiling venusian landscape lastly however venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide but because most forms light can not penetrate teh dense atmosphere rendering standard forms photography and videography ineffective but the nasa say they are working other things for studying venus and another project looking back old technology called mechanical computer and this project devices the first envisioned the and the project also going use teh world war conclusion when the nasa see working the send humans venus for studying venus the nasa say have possible solution for studying venus and they working other things for send the humans venus and the nasa working other approaches studying venus and another project looking back old technology calle mechanical computers these divines were first envisioned teh and played important role the and our travels earshot and beton should not limited danger and doubts,1
don think necessary have facial action coding system people can tell from other people some students might uncomfortable showing emotions facial action coding system not that important think that just getting the way and waste money students don need know other students emotions some students can feel really shy and uncomfortable let everyone know would uncomfortable also had through the facial action system would have many emotions really easy tell what kind emotion they have some examples are when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you surprised another example when your orbicularis oris tightens your lips show anger those examples are proving pint you can tell what there emotions are you don need facial action coding system tell you what emotions you are feeling anyone can tell what your emotions are waste money might uncomfortable for some students,2
support the authors details going use details from this passage the author thinks that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers here one detail from the passage that supports this often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size but would very challenging only because the conditions venus are very rough and must elevated off the ground most miles above the ground get good look plus more details from the passage say thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planets surface temperatures average over degrees despite all those dangers think very possible get better look the beautiful planet that live next heres quote show that nasa doesn let little things get the way our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,2
have you ever worner what the face mars really some people say that rock formation that resembles human face some say that was alien artifact think that the face just some kind rock formation the face has anything with alien would suprise and interested all you guys would first all the face relate some kind alien things why you think would keep secret imagine that actually had something with alien and told everyone that would benefit for because more people would interested nasa will make get more money make good profits scientist would actually want see some kind alien artifact too but that not what are finding right now second all the people who said are hiding something don even have any prove jim garvin chief scientist for nasa mars exploration program said that felt this was important taxpayers that shows that are not hiding anything send spacecraft twice after the first picture which was with better calmar really make sure what say true even show the would all the picture the people who said are hiding something have idea what they are talking about conclusion telling you that the face saw mars was nothing but rock formation don believe everything you hear because some them not have prove what they are saying make sure was what think was send mars global surveyor april and send again april find some things that have with alien will tell you guys but for now that not the case lets not think that the face have something with aliens,3

this new technology would good thing use classroom because teacher would able determine students reaction comment made from another student lets say student was getting bullied the teacher then would able tell how the student feeling after what just got called made fun them and would able make the appropriate action against the other student but this technology should used only for certain times classroom the technology would able prevent fights schools before they even happen but the students the classroom don want their emotions read computer new technology they should have the right not have their emotions read without them knowing also this technology would help the subside problem this world would prevent kids that school that get bullied realise what they have instead going home crying their rooms locking the doors from their parents and eventually killing themselves because some student the same school bullying the other student because too selfish and doesn think before they say something bullying big problem and this new technology would very useful schools and across the globe but there pro con new creations that people make everyday and people around the world will continue expose them everyday,3
having technology that allows the ability know persons feelings could help this world have less crime less suicide and know persons true feelings its something doctors could use hospitals know more about there patients this technology accurate could change the world being able calculate persons emotions isnt something everyone thinks about daily bases but having computer that reads all major muscles your face and being able calculate someones feelings could lot good being able know when someone feeling bored class tired could make the teacher activity that requiere movement wake them students wouldnt able home acting sick anymore either making schools not have many absences grades would improve because students wouldnt bored since the teacher could change the learning method they are using there are millions people who suffer from depredation and lot them put fake smile their face people dont know how they really feel specially since they dont talk about their depression doctors had computer know when someone fake smiling because they are hiding their depression they could something prevent that person from taking their own life you cant always know how someone feeling but having check ups calculate they are depressed could start many suicides could stoped this technology this could benefit hospitals allowing them take better look patients feelings know the patient lying about feeling better just home with doctors being able know there patients true feelings they can decide when might right time give them bad news know when will best take them into surgery they wouldnt able smile and say they feel good anymore because the computer would know its fake smile the article says imagin being able detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions this computer would bring good the students and all the other people could help should used help students that way the school would know they are depressed bored tired grades would improve and students would like going school more and learning,3
the reason why the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents because how interesting examing when you are close the planet itself essentially when thinking traveling from and beyond should not limited dangers even the doubts such exploration buy should expand and exceed meet the very edges imagination and innovation that comes from exploring such substances space the true reason for examine venus for the innovation and progress science that comes from and how venus the closet planet have identical features earth even our sister planets are out the question for examination due dangerous conditions astronomers are fascinated venus since has the potential the most earth like planet our entire solar system the text states that the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters this quote indicates that venus has similar features what earth has therefore venus the nearest option when looking planets that are similar earth and also the consideration that have pretty long time frame for space travel there aren many options for safe and scientifically mission this our best option for productive wise for the space enviroment exploring this one solid reason for the author say that the trip venus would worthy pursuit but would have dangers but will able expand our innovation the science world nasa has plan allow scientist venus with blimp like vehicle which hould hover feet above the venusian landscape letting them examine the features venus the quote provides thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth the quote indicates that the scientists may feel toasty with that degrees fahrenheit them but the pressure that subhed the would the equivalent the sea level which earth overall these are not the easiest conditions but survivable for humans live and stay productive the task hand this another solid reason for the scientist travel venus and expand there knowledge and space innovation well even with hazardous conditions that are presented during there examination having the will and courage travel and observe the features this planet which has the potential similar the planet that live earth are able expand our thoughts and innovation space and able progress our space knowledge whole even though there will dangers that are presented during the journey you will protected science itself with its blimps from nasa the will for observation comparing earth and venus features overall worthy pursuit examine and observe the potential the identical planet earth from its features,4
should the electoral college removed thats been the arguments talks and thoughts over many years they ask would absolutely say yes the electoral college should removed but many people ask why simple all the votes that citizens make every four years never really goes directly the runners for presidents they always people who decide weather not they should approved wich obviously the should their whole majority the state voted for him her but thats not what the the feel they feel like they need approve the runners why you ask not sure they need all that why dont the people the house representatives just make their decisions since always come down them then there point the citizens voting for president but then agan feel like why should they choose who the president the whole usa are the one who need worry about the president,2
what the electoral college the electoral college process which consists the selection the electors meeting where they vote for president and the counting the votes the real question the electoral college helping just bringing our government farther towards disaster the electoral college should diminished because unfair direct election and the disaster factor begin keeping the electoral college could avoid run off elections this would help our governmental system because noted richard posner there pressure for run off elections when candidate wins majority the votes cast keeping the electoral college could help resolve run off elections what dont know will permanently work for our governmental system and worth the risk the electors are the ones voting for the president should question whether they should have control help avoid these run off elections the writer notes the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process reduced electoral college posner although that true that only one problem that would resolved the electoral college and olene benefit outnumbered the numerous disadvantages the electoral college moreover the disaster factor has huge impact the electoral collage the writer states the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse plumer this disaster was not the first disaster happen the system according plumer the system has had much more effect and damage the united states and this should not repeated again the writer also says electors have occasionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please plumer this goes show not only the electoral college beneficial but they can sneaky the electoral college should abolished because the atrocious outcomes capable doing our government not only the electoral college capable the disaster factor but also has direct election stated what the electoral college when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate electors office the federal register this means voters have control over whom controls the country that outrageous that the lives these people will affected someone they did not want the overpowering decisions their country writer plumer states the most basic level the electoral college unfair too voters well the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational plumer both these point show that the electoral college lowering our hopes for the government the writer also notes candidates don spend time states they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states plumer this proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead our countries government are going sit here and let them take advantage their power that will lead towards disaster all all the electoral collage should banished from the government who wants our government get weaker and more unfair the citizens taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard working government know can,5

personally think would benefit everyone abolish electrical colledge should change the election most popular voted this would easier and also fair the election should only determine who going our president not the electors this way just creates bid mess for them deal with anyway for example over percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now this year voters can expect another close election which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency the votes should direct determine who will president our country the electoral colledge consists electors thats alot electors why not just make more simple and try avoid voting the electors and lets try just vote directly for the president conclusion would have agree that should abolish electoral colledge should just get right the point lets just and only just vote for who should president don waste your time trying vote for the electors make easy for yourself each candidate running for president your state has his her own group electors why complicated,2

against the value using the facial action coding system because some people may try hide feeling like upset sad because they don know how tell someone why and how they feel just because they are hiding what they feel doesn mean that someone can take new technology and found out what their feeling because they wanted people know how they felt they would the other hand you use the technology you could change lesson student was becoming bored confused help them better school this technology could help more students pass classes they can graduate but some may not like the thought someone being able look computer and finding out what they are feeling they need respect what people feel and not try figure what wrong because they didn want tell they found out they person may get upset and confused what happened using this could cause people disappointed what people are feeling this could cause people get angry others just because the technology exists doesn mean that you have use believe that the facial action coding stem shouldn use this because people may not want others know want they feel they did they would tell them but they just told they wouldn need the facial action coding system some students may struggling with things and may talk but what they are feeling but they are confused they could just ask for help just because students dont show their feelings doesn mean that they won when they are ready you should let people express their feelings their own time not using technology that could tell what someone feeling using this technology would cause frustrated even more because they can tell people what they feel their own because the technology would tell people ins and not when the person ready tell people what they feel,3
exploring venus just important exporting the solar system venus earth twin sister the terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too exploring venus would help better understand more about our solar system and even our galaxy with venus being just like earth terms like density and size would fun explore venus but also venus isnt that far from but better understanding venus would help our space techology improve greatly with better understanding venus will better our knowledge not only our solar system but our galaxy venus has thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide which bad for because carbon dioxide gas element which traps heat that the sun gives all the planet our solar system and with venus atmosphere being mostly carbon most heat trap venus atmosphere with little escaping with all that heat that trap the tempur venus very hot even for our spacecraft but despise this exploring venus still good thing because long ago venus was once earth like planet just like her twin sister earth despite the challenge that venus giving will find way get past the acid clouds and the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere because through out human history have had many challenge species but have proven that are more than combles over coming this types challenges one day will get venus and will learn about her because human curiosity always win matter how challenging will overcome finally understanding venus will species will better our understanding not only our solar system but our galaxy well,3
dear senator believe should change the electoral college opinion the electoral college unfair begin with reduces the amount voters because the voters believe they don have say the election richard ponsero said can argued that the electoral college method selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has hope carrying their state democrats texas republicans california addition not directly vote for the president vote for people who believe will vote for the president also don think fair that candidate gets the majority vote she should recieve all the votes from the state believe should direct voting where the people get directly vote for the president and after the whole nation has voted tally the votes and see who got the most this method would best because people would prefer more and would make people believe they have say who becomes the president addition better than the electoral college because there less room for errors and will not unfair addition will make the candidates work harder get votes and they will try visit more the states because they know that the majority state democratic they believe they will easily win the votes from that state but was direct voting they would these states make sure they can get many votes possible from also another issue with the electoral college the picking the electors the picking the electors could bad because these electors could bad people who get lot votes for one candidate but still pick the other one conclude believe should get rid the electoral college because unfair voting system instead should change direct voting where every vote counts sincerely bobby,3

the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit depite the dangers giving idea what nasa working get around the danger giving reasons why venus sister planet the earth and showing some key items that could research venus the closest planet earth density and size often referred earth twin because this however their are some dangers exploring the planet more depth the author states long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today the author put this piece information show that should more research show that life once existed venus this planet could hold forms life but don have any research prove going venus depite the dangers would give more evidence materials prove that venus even more less similar earth this would also help understand our solar system more whole the author states nasa has one particuarly compelling idea for sending humans study venus nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape the author put this piece infomation prove that nasa trying come with possible solutions explore venus however they arent working out well vehicle like this would prevent them from collecting any rocks gases bring back and research studying venus could lead abundance solar power and the radiation would minimal the vehicle nasa planning will not allow researchers take samples rocks gas anything else that matter the author states peering venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions because most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms photography and videography ineffective more importantly researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance this explain that the dangers going venus far outweigh the saftey there lots research still done venus the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit depite the dangers giving idea what nasa working get around the danger giving reason why venus sister planet the earth and showing some key items that could research the author states our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation the author put that piece information explain that the dangers are worth,5
think there should driverless cars there really reason for them and they put peoples lives danger for reason there reason for driverless cars the purpose the driver have someone take responsability for the actions done involving the car taken with the car the car driving its self the car can not take responsability for the commands was given just like anything that needs the car given instructions from computer that car could hacked and cause accident where they not know who hold responsable for the death someone who chose not get smart car and wants drive their car themselves not only you have worry about the cars but also the people who chose the old fashion way and chose drive their car what the smart car has glitch and that glitch all takes take lives may say that there has not been cadent yet does not maen there can not one all,2

think that driverless cars are definately option for transportation the future for however much would decrease our pollution and fuel consumption would take far too long settle out cases whenever accidents happen think there would more problems than that well with smart cars driving the roads there would most likely need smart roads for the cars drive lastly the cost smart car with all the technology that comes with would far too expensive for the average citizen purchase with new technology comes problems and errors the technology with cars driving public roads highway speeds any problem could result big accident those problems were occur there would piles upon piles settlement cases needing worked out companies manufacturing these cars would losing popularity and money when these accidents occur also the question running through everyone minds will who fault people would raging they had pay the bills accident they were not even driving stated the article driverless cars will most likely need smart roads with built sensors them operate that the case only major interstates and highways will have smartcards unless the country gets enough money make smart cars drive every road america which would probably cost billions and trillions dollars not think country for that matter ready for expense like that for just something can not see happening anytime soon the article driverless cars are coming says that driver will most likely need the drivers seat case emergency however how possible for driver focused what going they are not physically driving the car does say the artifical that manufacturers could include monitors for the drivers watch something while they sit the driver seat but with all this technology how everday working man supposed able afford one these cars would expect one these cars cost twice much brand new car today not think will that popular they are not cheap enough for anyone buy mentioned above there are many problems that could occur these driverless smart cars would put the roads the problem who fault would the biggest for problem for the cities and states the cost the roads would definately hurt them also for the everyday citizen the cost buying one these cars would feat itself think driverless cars are something should reach for but think should wait that until all the the problems that come with are settled,4
wouldn you want control your own saftey would with driverless cars the driver will never charge that they are very dangerous and could cause damage not only the driver but others around them just like all technology could have slip that could cause people their lifes there are many different reasons why the driverless car bad idea mostly has with who has control with technology something could always wrong this case the driver could have control the driver could have control when they were not ready both these issues could cause wreck accursed paragraph talks about ways that the car can tell the driver when needs take over such seats that vibrate tell the driver that she needs take over would this seat wake the driver the driver had fallen asleep vibrating seat would not wake some people also might help some people sleep more this good example paragraph when says wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive while waiting drive many drivers could fall asleep and the car could possibly not wake them possibly costing the driver their life now yes paragraph says that the car could have special touch sensor the steering wheel make sure the driver alert the only problem there what the driver has his hands the wheel but isn alert what the sensor malfunctions and can tell the driver alert both these questions could cause problem for the driver the end think that cars should driven the old passion way where the car controled the driver and nothing else that way there mistake whether accident the driver cars fault,3
the world need the cars not just for hang out with your friends family the are lot people who need car like transportation when they going the work also for emergency that means car they has continue the world people they needed car they are necessary for better style life that way the humanity but aslo how many life are they die driving car something people they don control what they are doing and that kind people put danger other and that way can affected that both people they atre straying use the technology made car more save and inteligente for the humanidad and that way less car crash but the thing most important the life billion people who are driving the world the world need people who invent new thing that work better the car really necessary destroy the cars the world invent new transportation for the humanidad,1
the article making mona lisa smile the author describes how new technology called the facial action coding system enables computers identify human emotions the use this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable believe this technology would great use classroom would really help the teacher with his her lesson huang predicts that classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored simple classroom computer can determine students emotions that would great assistance teacher the teacher would then know should into greater detail should make his lesson plan little more interesting human beings can really good hiding their emotions with the facial action coding system one would able hide their true emotions someone was really depressed but they portray themselves happy this technology could stop that person from hurting themselves others school therapist school social worker had this technology would make their jobs much easier they could sense what the students are really feeling rather than what the students want them think their feeling also the school therapist would know the patient would need prescribed any medicine another reason why the facial action coding system would good idea because stated the article could reveal much about the science emotions the facs facial action coding system could detect false smile you are not feeling genuinely happy you are just putting happy face this technolgy would able see through what your false act this new technology could become the next big thing would able uncover the truth about alot people the last argument going state why the facs would valuable detecting students emotions that the technology could tell whether student telling the truth not the article states paragraph that usually when someone squint their eyes slightly produce wrinkling the corner their eyes usually means that their not being truthful facs uses muscle clues determine whether person being truthful not this would great classroom for example someone being bullied and they tell the teacher but the bully says isn bullying anyone this would great for the teacher the teacher would know which one her students telling the truth conclusion the facial action coding system would superb idea this new technology would not only very interesting but would also save many lives this technology could used many different jobs could also help many people with this technology you would longer have take someones word how their feeling even when you have gut feeling telling you otherwise rather than assuming what someone feeling you could now know for sure with the facial action coding system,5
dear senator florida after reading this article about electoral college believe that should keep electoral college because makes easier count all the votes for the president the united states one main reasons because what get tie the votes there whole rosses that need through just break that tie have electoral college then makes easier because just count the amount electoral votes given each state stated that should keep electoral college because makes earier count the electoral votes for the president the united states said this because source what the electoral college the electoral college consiste electors majority electoral votes required elect the president office the federal register also get tie there whole rosses that through break that tie according source the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defense the system are wrong that case the election would thrown the house representatives where state delegations vote the president plumer other reason for keep the electoral college because makes much easier for them count how many votes get the whole united states just chose out president according the map source defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president showest that depending how popular how big the population the state has more electoral votes this has nothing with how big small the state for example the state alaska the united states biggest state and only has electoral votes but the state california wich very small compared alaska has electoral votes the reasons that they state source defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president are very interesting and can convince you keep electoral college certainty outcome everyone presiden swing states big states and avoid run off elections hopefully got you keep electoral college and forget about the idea changing electing the president popular vote qualified citizens have stated opinion the topic and hopefully you will agree with,3
driverless cars are said safe and reliable the road could imagine future when one buys cars but isn always because the best things thinking about driverless cars that how you know your family truly safe and secure this car when you open the hood car like this pretty much all you are going see wires hard drives and everything you would find computer these driverless cars right now still have have alter driver the car because they aren truly driverless cars yet google driverless car has over half million miles without crash but their are things these cars still cant right now and will always that way google car will alert the driver take over when specific condition such pulling and out driveway dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents google driverless car maybe doing well right now but how many driverless cars they have still going the same when there are more them the roads driverless cars don drive like normal car would has all these wires hard drives and you will also find normal belts pistons and sparks driverless cars are controled completely different way then cars are right now before can even think about having driverless cars the road right now would have put massive amount work the roads bridges highways and interstates already have these smart road systems worked surprisingly well but they required massive upgrades existing roads something that was simple too expensive practical they say the car driverless car but right now there has human alert the car for serious reasons the cars can not called driverless cars the human the car has alert incae the road ahead requires human skill they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents most people know don want drive around that but the driverless cars can not that for themselves with cars that are going driverless you know that they are going have lot distractions them other people that are driving would look over and might see person kick back reading book and might freak out while driving down the road lets say seventy miles per hour that could end badly driverless cars can become hazard other people the roads driverless cars might not have any crashes but could cause many more the future driverless cars are danger people all over the world they may say that much safer than other cars but can just dangerous other car and could cause more distractions the road around other drivers matter what they say about driverless cars they are always going unsafe and expensive drive make and buy,3

according the article driverless cars are coming companies have been working cars that need less human control earning these cars the moniker driverless opinion against the development and distribution these vehicles having driverless cars would promote the lazy characteristics drivers hazardous the roads and expensive produce these cars should not the top companies developmental lists driverless car isn really new the world the article states google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since the idea driverless cars isn scary enough add the equation the idea that under specific conditions when would the ideal time that someone would need switch car autopilot the production these cars will make drivers lazy many car accidents are the fault driver not paying attention and add person behind the wheel smart car car that can drive itself and that number will multiply can let people get comfortable with the idea that car will prevent them from having accidents the production smart cars could also hazardous the roads the article states that the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone these sensors danger detecting devices and other computerized appliances that help these cars function may not always reliable what could happen they weren properly installed and malfunction many cars today that aren smart cars get called back factories for complications adding more fancy attractions lousy idea another reason why the production these cars horrible idea money the very same reason why the production the smart road systems did not work out how much our tax dollars are going into this industry this money that don have wasting advancement that not needed this new breed car going nothing for the economic standing the world companies are producing these cars our expense and then not making them available the average person companies like mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have cars that can drive themselves then who are they going market them the people the upper class will the only ones with smart cars their possession conclusion believe that the production and distribution smart cars awful idea having driverless cars would promote the lazy characteristics drivers hazardous the roads and expensive produce the number accidents would increase technology completely unpredictable and simply not have firm economical standing producing these vehicles believe that should using this money improve other more important things like the educational systems,5
the article driverless cars are coming think its not good have the car because its distraction the driver you have kids they might laughing screaming and doing other stuff that can distract you when driving helpful for the car able drive while the parent taking care there kids okay have google maps and stuff like that help you out sensors are good because they could help you out when your not paying attention when something coming and you dont see coming they can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine which can allow the car slow down quickly bmw announced the development traffic jam assistant the car can handle functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the frier keeps hold the wheel none the cars developed far are completely driverless they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but they are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills some manufactures hope that bringing car entertainment and information systems that use heads displays which can turned off instantly when the driver needs take over this way the car system actually safety feature driving laws are focus keeping the driver passengers and pedestrians safe have this then think that will help out the reason for this because wouldnt focused reading our texts anything like that know that our car can drive its own think would smart have this our car would help out the long run would keep the other drivers safe didnt have worry much about everything,3
driverless cars honesty think driverless cars would dangerous think that because you never know what could happen the car might explode due all the things the car thats making drive its the car might over work its self and maybe cause car crashes well and car crashes are not want need car crashes are big things that don need happen all time well know they happen alot during these days but driverless cars just feel like with driverless cars its going happen whole lot more driverless cars feel like they would cause more car trouble with all the explosions and disfunction and especially all the techniques and material that would inside the car make function its causing explosions because all the material over working that car thats why agree not having driverless cars its unneccessary have driverless cars when people made cars for reason that people can drive the cars not for the cars work ther own what the point having driverless car might well just walk you want have driverless car,2
all our lives many people have talked about how there would flying cars the future you see countless movies and shows the most popular probably being back the future unfortunately the flying car yet made however many companies are working driverless cars cars that you can just get and they will drive you where ever you need amazing and unbelieveable this idea sounds worth the risks able make safe car that runs its own seems very difficult not something that can made overnight fact google has made and still working driverless cars since this idea has been around for long enough but why not see any driverless cars the road today company can seem make car smart enough drive itself bmw annouced years ago the development traffic jam assistant this car can drive speeds miles per hour althought the not driver must keep his her hands the wheel and they are alerted when they must take over driving meaning that they must pay attention all times what the point these called driverless cars they are not completely driverless this idea can totally change the world although should their really driverless cars the roads they are not completely self driven maybe not what someone isn paying attention the road then suddenly the car put situation where doesn know what forcing the driver spring into action this could deadly plus what people forget how properly drive after years car doing for them then when they need take over the driving their driving skills may rusty and they definately won know what advanced situation such the car was skidding and going off the road leading many injury even death with that being said there are still many injury and deaths with people operating cars you may say that the argument invalid although you can teach humans carful car and yes make mistakes but humans unlike computers can adapt complicated situations driverless cars seem very helpful but really worth the risk death would you really put you saftey into the hands computer the negative seems out weigh the positive not saying that impossible idea just very unrealistic maybe they should just start working flying cars instead,2
having different technology helps people people like can helpful many different ways for example person can speak their techonology that helps people that don have have voice with computer techonology useful many different ways the use the technology the article making mona lisa smile nick alto would really valuable the new computer software stores similar anatomical information electronic code imagine computer that knows when you happy sad says the author examples that they use when computer can tell you are happy sad you smile when web appeals your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different that would great because you are watching something and then all sudden comes and you can skip you want entertaining and fun and not boring and dumb would also very helpful you are school classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor that would really helpful for some people just case somone dosen want speak they are confused the computer will know right away there also other examples for this the same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for the videogames which would become more fun for the person playing the videogame video surgery huang also says most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication computers need understand that too would think that the use this technology read the emotional expression students classroom valuable the way works and the way could help many different ways this passage wants understand that new technology could coming soon which could help many different ways,3
humans our minds are bound exploring the unknown order feed our curiosity long the human mind concerned our curious thoughts will always what discoveries does space have store more the planetary side things what great discoveries does the planets the solar system have store out all the planets our solar system venus the most valuable and challenging planet discover since the only planet the solar system closely resemble earth despite dangerous conditions order feed our curiousity venus have pass the dangers the planet presents and explore the landscape the entire planet venus has been given the nickname evening star despite being planet venus has gain more leading nickname for earth twin the reason was given that nickname that venus density and size are closely similar earth also has the closest distance earth due the similarity has earth scientists and astronomers are fascinated venus and what was like the past the article the text states long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth,2
driverless cars are good invention for the future driverless cars can help effect safety traffic and the pollution the air driverless cars could help communities and the economy many ways driverless cars could change the way people commute driverless cars begin come play less people will have drive their own car many people know tons people get into accidents everyday because the people behind the wheel making harmful decisions driverless cars were put out the roads there would less traffic accidents because there would not people behind the wheel who are reckless and causing these accidents occur driverless cars alert the drive when needed when about come into contact with something therefore these cars will help reduce the effects human error and give more reaction time the human the passenger side this could also shorten the amount people taking the bus the places they need which would make the pollution problem way less common thing also lots people with disabilities can not drive with the help driverless car those people could get the places they need instead someone else driving them them not being able all driverless cars would also just provide convince the world lots people dread the drive work everyday long drive disney but with driverless cars they would not have drive there they could sit and relax and not have worry about making traffic accident because them being tired behind the wheel the factories making these cars would need more help thus bringing more jobs for the people and making the economy stronger this could also bring money the people who want these cars because the convince them driverless cars could lead more advancements technology help driving become safer which would bring more money for the economy the invention the driverless car could something that impacts the society and world new and modern way driverless cars could impact our society many ways and boost the economy these cars could change someones life between life and death there would less accidents making the health and living rate higher people with disabilities would now able drive and live their lifes freely like should always been finally will not only help the lifes humans but will help the earth giving off less pollution and people traveling less pollution dense vehicles which would better the world,3
from the article making mona lisa smile the gauthier talks about how there new technology that call facial action coding system facs for short facs enables computers identify human emotions epicures and aslo videos the article making mona lisa smile the author states that the famous mona lisa piute copy leonardo vinci the renaissance painting the painting mona lisa her facial expression was she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry there way that technology can scan painting from the and find the painting facial expression out paragraph the author says the facial expressions for each emotion universal observes huang even though individuals often vary degrees expression huang saying that impossible find out someones emotions photo them paragraph the author says the process begins when the computer constructs computer model the face all major mels the model must move like human muscles the author saying that there possible way that computer can scan persons expression photo because the the camaras frame and the movement the person the photo paragraph the author says your home can handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile the mona lisa painting was the impossible figure out what was her expression the author goes deep into the article tell the reader that technology can identify human emotions paragraph the author says tyche mona lisa demonstration really intended bring smile your face while shows just how much this computer can the author explain how technology syncing into students brain and mind paragraph the author says fact humans perform this same impressive calculation every day for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face the author saying humans have questions about others expressions,1
dear state senator experience strongly believe that you should get rid the electoral college popular vote you that the votes would become fair voters and more voters would actually pay attention the campine the other hand see why you would want keep the electoral college but let explain you two the many reasons why you should get rid first people argue that the electoral college does pay attention some the regiment voters plumer article says thanks the quirks the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over percent voters would prefer direct election the voters who like the electoral college pretty much just want see that they can trust them just for the popular votes succeed but honestly think they still shouldn the ones choose even they may help the popular votes little they aren fair lot ways way more voters are against them than with let explain one reasons believe you should get rid the electoral college because isn fair voters lot the time voters don trust that the electoral college pays attention the votes sent out acording plumer article the indefensible electoral college states the same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please when voters hear that chaos starts they want have say for who the next president will not just the electoral college say there have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based what they believe and not other voters for example hawaii the vice president richard nixon validated his opponents votes voters worry and get angry when there trust broken they want the ones vote because course they trust themselves you get rid the electoral college voters would more satisified and feel that their vote would fair lastly the second reason why believe that getting rid the electoral college that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought who they vote they think that their vote won matter they won care who wins they would most likely jot down random candidate and send the article defense the electoral college posner states republicans california knowing their vote will have effect they have less incentive pay attention the campaign than they would have the president were picked popular vote with that said there support that states people would have beter interest voting they had popular vote and more electoral college believe people would actually spend more their time debating who should deserve president conclude reasons please take them consideration voters would treated much fairly and pay more attention voting than they now believe you should get rid the electoral college there will less arguing sincere proper name,5
leonardo vinci was one the greatest renaissance painters the time his study the human anatomy allowed him create pictures that captured the humana state his most well known paintings the mona lisa the mona lisa women that has sort complacent facial features she doesn really look happy sad this was the popular thought until new technology was created this technology called the facial action coding system this technology able deduce what emotion person feeling able this hathout the person even showing obvious emotion this technology can also implemented many spheres life including the classroom the use this technology read the expressions students learning environnement can help students learn more effectively allowing for immediate feedback from student allowing for the quick shift lesson plan and being able help and support students emotionally this technology can help get immediate feedback from students almost all class rooms nation wide there similar routine learn something practice for homework and then see student understanding taking quiz over while this may effective can improved ten fold with the facial action coding system the technology could understand emotion students present time teacher wouldn have wait give out quiz see students were having issues they could teach the subject and then immediatly know students are having difficulty understanding huang the creator facs states that classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored teachers are able recieve this information their teaching would become more effective teachers could change lesson plans order fit the needs the students and give extra support and help those children that are still struggling facs can also help excite students about learning this important because matter how much teacher trys help student the student will not implore anything thet not want learn computers are able read students are excited bored lesson teachers would add visuals and what not make more interesting student this would make them want learn not them being required learn totality the ability able perceive students emotions would help students academically allowing teachers change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand classrooms continue the facs technology would help students more emotionally stable while school valuable place learn new information and facts really place for children grow and become more independent and better human beings while grades matter the emotional and pyschological health student far more valuable the facs technology could act army school counselors high school and middle school students tend not share their emotions even with their parents facs could identify students that are emotionally troubled have depression contemplate self harm even have mental illness once students like these are identified then counselors and social workers could step allowing for students helped right now students that struggle with these issues not share their feelings they not get help and carry like they are fine while many may turn out okay even one taking their own life somebody else too much while facs may not able help eliminate all signs emotional distress can surely make difference another benefit using facs that reads emotions silently students don have portray certain emotion for the technology understand what they are really feeling student asked how they are they probably give surface level fine answer the technology reads through that completely eliminating awkward one one conversations with counselors and allowing for all students reached while there are many positives this technology some might argue that computers can not actually calculate human emotion they argue that human emotion not soechting that can should understood because would ruin the entirety feeling certain ways however while some arguments may warranted many are based off falsehoods begin emotion can understood scientific level emotion the brain not the heart the way the facs understands emotion simple maps out model the face looks the shape and positon all the muscles then associates the different facial movements with different emotion for example your orbicularis oris muscles around your mouth tighten your lips show when you are angry even works when person trying mask emotions during fake smile the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sideways while real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners the mouth these examples can show how science able understand emoting probably better than most humans arguments that use that falsehood that science unable understand emotion completely false conclusion the ability read the actual emotion and reactions students class rooms extremely valuable because allows for greater understanding and excitment subject along with the ability help students emotionally stable this technology implemented into schools students will overall better feel better and make brighter world for tomorrow facs something revolutionary that hopefully all can learn something from,6
did you know that nasa viking spacecraft was the first spacecraft any sort see the mysterious face mars this mysterious face was first discovered scientist from nasa that has been researching this unusual shadowy likeness human face since about twenty five years ago name ellie get all sorts questions and opinions asked about the human face some people say that they not think that real and that nasa just making get more people notice well that would wrong considering that have pictures prove know that the face just natural landform because the pictures show almost equivalent mesa butte and looks identical the middle butte idaho know that the shadowy likeness human face just natural landform because looks almost equivalent mesa butte have many questions asking things like how you know that aliens didn form and how know that this picture not photoshopped get nasa more commercial business the answer don know exactly what formed but our research shows that natural landform first all pictures not lie especially that camera that took with took the picture with using camera absolute maximum resolution this camera each pixel the images spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo know from our research also the mysterious landform that captured looked like mesa butte landforms that are common around the american midwest add that the face takes the same shape lava dome and the same height not only does the face look almost equivalent mesa butte but also looks almost identical most the middle butte the snake river plain idaho another resona that know that the face just natural landform because looks almost identical landform idaho people send nasa emails and letters asking questions one our most states opinions just because looks like landform earth doesn mean anything things might different there and there could aliens there yes that could true but our research and pictures also prove wrong the first snapshot the face was captured was long time ago since then our camera and photo quality has improved today now have way better pictures the face than did over twenty five years ago that means that can see the landform better and look the different characteristics the landform then after looked the characteristics found that the face had almost the exact same size shape quality landform idaho united states also one our researches stated the definition the middle butte stated that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars thousands web surfers had been anxiously waiting for images for nasa revealed until one day released the pictures knew already web surfers found that there was alien monument after all know from our research also released how took the picture had picture taken camera board mgs but had peer through clouds then people started saying statements like perhaps alien markings were hidden haze once again that can not true because the characteristics and qualities the face look exactly like part the middle butte the snake river plain idaho now you have been proved wrong and hope all your questions were answered about the face least the questions that were stated the article have done lot research this mysterious human face and found that was not created aliens know that landform because looks like mesa butte and looks almost identical the middle butte the snake river plain idaho therefore this face just landform,4
venus the second planet our solar system and despite how close earth largely unexplored the reason why its been untouched for around years that venus too hot and has too much atmospheric pressure which would crush and melt any spacecraft its surface another reason that there are clouds corrosive sulfuric acid however nasa working ways study venus more safely the passage the author talks about why astronomers are fascinated with venus they talk about how how the astronomers think that venus used more earth like than today with its valleys mountains and craters paragraph though paragraph the challenges presented trying study venus more crosley have more negatives than positives one the biggest problems that venus has the hottest surface temperature the planets the solar system despite that mercury closer the sun than venus another problem being faced the immense atmospheric pressure which around times greater than earth the author also talks about how nasa trying find ways counteract these problems one example that they give paragraph that simple electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber that crosley emulates the surface conditions venus nasa has found that the technology lasted three weeks under those conditions another way that nasa trying solve the problems venu surface using old mechanical computers which don use the same kind technology regular modern computers but gears and levers instead conclusion putting spacecraft the surface venus may possibility the future may never find way keep spacecraft the surface for more than few weeks time which cost ineffective but the author says paragraph our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,3
while you may believe that this the work advanced and unknown species then you wrong but let look the details and evidence have make final determination let use the information provided nasa clarify this arguement there evidence life mars there isn even water oxygen without water oxygen the planet can not sustain such life furthermore natural land formations earth exist like this paragraph garvin says reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho goes furthermore clarifying information about the phenomenon saing that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa around the same height the face mars garvin goes with the rule thumb stating you can discern things digitial image times bigger than the pixel size even there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were the photo taken the face shows that really spans meters not meters this also clarifies that aliens didn create this object because measurements are closet that natural formations found earth looking the evidence provided can discern friend that this isn the work aliens the research provided nasa has record file any extra terrestrial lifeforms also the research indicates that this natural because the formation measurements are closer proximity earth landforms also conspiracy theorist lack validity and credibility well research evidence conclusion provided this can determine that this just natural formation,3
scientist nasa their best figure the right information they have about the unmasking the face mars was actually better idea keep the face mars secret just between the nasa team then nothing was bad news could have been told after getting all the right information the possiblities knowing what this and letting everyone know was very hard been there since and last some resolute the face mars nasa very important and they know that better not tell anyone about this think the people should respect their decison because they found most importantly not letting people make big deal out this because they don know what could yet sometime can say somethings the most part because better not let anyone know before people crazy and around asking bunch questions the face mars was discovered and the time that has passed easier see how actually looks but courcey you can just send someone out space and actually see what going not that easy just that there could some species that are out there somewhere and don even know about period time believed might have been alien artifact but doesn look like alien face which something could for sure about that seeing the picture that the moc team revealing the photo the face people weren satisfied they thought the people must thinking there something space should clam should best worried that what might have happens when people don listen what say best and what they think right but the end all this story and this wait actually that turns out that actually martian equivalent butte the mesa common landforms around american west and the lava dome that formed isolated mesa which the same height the face mars everything perfectly fine and everyone can clam since found out the actual and correct information and not just some random answers that people were going around and saying about this,3
you agree disagree having technology read students emotional expressions imagine being able detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions new software has been developed that improves accuracy perceiving the emotions others this new software the facial action coding system has promising applications for variety industries personality will like have technology read emotional expressions would fun have that school shows just how much this computer can imagine computer that knows when your happy sad the same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games video surgery said huang huang and his colleague experts are developing better ways for humans and computer communicate the process begins when the computer constructs computer model the face all major muscles the model must move like human muscles haves six basic emotions happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements the facial muscles this how works all about those muscular action units they even indicate the difference between genuine smylie and forced one the real smile the zygomatic major muscles taht begin your cheek bones lift the corner your mouth that our instruction muscles are called orbicularis oculi pars palabras make crow feet around your eyes that instruction agree that students should have this facial action coding system schools not only well help reading emotions but may also help for students that want actors and people that like doing art and like painting faces huang and his colleague are very smart for making the facial action coding system for school,3
first the author begin talking about venus the things should know but the challenge place examine more closely also the author says that referred earth twin and very similar size and dogaru planetary neighbor the thick atmosphere the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system our sister planet inhospitable then the author talks about the thick atmosphere and that more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere also talks about our planet surface and atmospheric savarese over degrees fahrenheit faintly they says that these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth says that are not easy conditions but the nasa working other approaches studying venus and also many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus last the author ending with reflection they says that challenge venus and how this option value and also says how human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors last how our imagination and innovation are doing exploring the earth and the moon striving meet the challege presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,1

believe that driverless car would beneficial the sense that you can not afford fly airplane for long distance travel then you could use the driverless car the only way you would have take over for the car the situation occurs like accident heavy road construction you are driving california florida for example would alot more comfortable then having drive all those long hours you might also have stop for gas every once while but that acceptable the benefits the driverless car are endless certain car company puts television into the center dashboard then the driver could move his her seat back and relax and watch they could also just sit back and enjoy the ride much better then having drive long distance thus running the risk falling asleep getting distracted phone something like that need the car shuts off the automatically and moves the seat back the set position and the driver takes over the sensors would able sense something far down the road give the driver enough heads able take control the car time luxury car company like cadillac audi could also make the interior the car more comfortable and more enjoyable make the long distance drive more worth while then flying and going through airport security and all those lines when you could hop driverless car and jump the highway and let the car take over the car company would also have make the car more safe accident were occur would much rather ride drive driverless car then having risk falling asleep the wheel all know how dangerous that thats big problem for the and the solution the driverless car this think would great idea for car companys and would make them alot money they could make these cars affordable there are few draw backs this car but think its great idea,4

the article driverless cars are coming the author makes great points for and against driverless cars some his augments for driverless are very interesting and definitely out weighs the cons driverless cars threes three main points that made for driverless cars and how fast coming closer having them everywhere with driverless cars you can have you car drive mph brake when you close another car and they can also notify the driver she isn paying attention the road everyday getting close and closer having complete driverless cars bmw made car that can handle speeds mph and they also added really inviting feature the car has special touch sensors that alert you anytime you take your had off the wheel there many benefits this let say someone speeding four times over the speed limit and you have move out the way before they can hit you with your hands being the wheel and the car driving you can move out the way and take complete control the car another example you were driving your son daughter their friend house and you had look for which house you can sit the car the driving while you looking for the house and that alone can help may reduces finder benders neighborhoods because the car can break when its getting close another car all its own notifications some car companies have been trying make cars that have hands flashing light the windshield when you take your hands off the when aren paying attention the road this idea can help perent many accidents and help improve driving skills conclusion all these ideas and all this new techonology cars will help stop and lower the percentage accidents dramatically anywhere from having the car break its own driving certain speed limit while you look for your childs friend house can help stop many accidents are getting closer and closer safer driving age each and everyday,3
what lies ahead will scary day when driverless cars become the new normal imagine roads filled with cars but the drivers are like nalbert zombies sure having cars that drive themselves sounds splendid but would the benefits really outweigh the cons for many people learning drive and getting their license huge milestone like one step closer becoming independant adult can imagine teens growing and never learning drive that would like not learning swim driving skill that people need aquire even driverless cars become popular because machines fail you can always depend machines accurate all the time you might thinking that machines don make mistakes often humans but humans are the ones that make the machines what happens you are riding driverless car and just stops working will you just sit there and wait die the passage says that most driverless cars aren actually driverless they need assistance from humans the fact that the car does most tasks like steering accelerating and braking makes easy for humans get distracted most people get distracted their cellphones alone they thought they could totally rely the car what they needed they would probably totally unaware their surroundings there reason that only few states allow the use semi autonomous cars the laws are written for cars that are controlled humans the laws place currently would not sufficient for self driving cars sure the laws could changed but who gets decide what the guides self driving cars should human brains are easily adaptable but machines need programmed what happens when car faces situation that isn ready for also what happens someone hacks into the car system and makes malfunction there could computer virus that would cause all the cars the world crash although think there are lots cons driverless cars acknowledge the benefits early versions semi driverless cars have been somewhat successful driving half million miles without crash however that doesn mean that totally autonomous cars will successful think certain features cars like cruise control are huge benefit but don know willing trust machines take the steering wheel yet who knows maybe fifteen years from now will own own driverless car but there are some huge advances that need made first,4
human emotions allows see and know lot about one person looking someones facial expression usually easy tell whether they are happy sad angry everyday will make facial expression even when don know really are the facial action coding system can allow keep students classrooms entertained while learning lesson just seeing there facial expressions this great idea and can truly work will keep students focused and allow them pay more attention class room setting this can help lot because students will more entertained and will pay attention class millions students school every single day dreading what they will learn next half the time when you class you will look over and see one person sleeping however the facial action coding system put classrooms this could give students chance more alive during lesson since able read our facial expressions can see when students are becoming bored irritated the lesson and switch little bit fact could possibly make learning fun again students will longer dread going class all the time and can finally something look forward too installing the facial action coding system into classrooms teachers would able understand their students emotions more and know what people are becoming distracted classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored teachers would able know they need switch the lesson and make more entertaining this could cause less problems students failing school and really change everything fact more teachers make classroom learning fun more students will less likely fail now students pay attention classrooms but having this new system could benefit the teachers and the students students could finally see the fun learning and teachers would know that students are bored the facial action coding system great idea and could help out lot classrooms learning can finally fun again,3
venus very interesting planet who wouldn want discover more about studying venus the author said good idea because allows people discover something new that could possibly become the second home humans expand people imagination and finding new innovations for new planet new earth for humans the passage said paragraph numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite its proximity meaning that its going challenging discover and examine venus these scientists will everything possible learn its weaknesses and strengths even takes decades make possible the passage also said paragraph why are scientists even discussing further visits its surface astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system meaning that astronomers are doing everything possible examine venus and possible that these humans are able exist this planet futher more centuries many people may not notice but venus has many things that not many know are aware for example paragraph says thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth meaning that these conditions that venus has may very extreme and humans must cautious when entering this planet the passage also says that venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land its surface meaning that venus also comparable earth although they have their differences venus not only allowing people make new innovations but expanding their imagination and allowing them challenge themselves and keep pushing themselves until they feel satisfied for how much they have discovered the passage stated the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans study venus showing that they will keep inventing and creating new ideas until they are able discover enough information allow any human being into this planet lastly these creative scientists have created new innovations and materials allowing them enter this dangerous planet called venus paragraph said nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray showing that these scientists are working from their failures and improving from them also paragraph said therefore scientists seeking conduct thorough mission understand venus would need get close and personal despite the risks many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus showing that these scientists are doing everything they can and examining what they are able create despite their failures and trying contribute the planet paragraph also says our ravelston earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation showing that people will expand more their ideas and push more their imagination allowing them create and discover new things and materials for this planet venus conclusion the author should able study about venus and attract many people attention showing them new discoveries and new innovations will show these human beings that they will able live upon another earth and allow them face new challenges this planet called venus,3

innovation for the future that what occuring right now you read this driving your own car thing the past with the new and coming invention driverless cars new ideas are sprouting how make the semi autonomous vehicle into fully autonomous vehicle wasting your time driving will thing the past driverless cars would excellent invention due the increased safety measures that will enable safer road conditions google cars are semi autonomous and have driven more than half million miles without crash which shows how safe they are this due the increased safety measures that still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents this shows how the google cars are able drive the easy everyday road trips work school home which what the majority one car used for yet when the car encounters circumstance that more complicated will not try navigate through the complicated circumstance but instead alert the driver take over this shows how safe the car because able notice when situation too complicated for handle and then alert the driver the impending situtation therefore google cars would increase the safety road conditions bmw huber has researched ways that will sustain the driver awareness autonomous car even though the driver not actually driving bmw has stated that they will bring heads displays that can turned off instantly when the driver needs take overstretching not available drivers trying text with cell phone this way the car system actually safety feature and safety big concern this shows how the driverless cars inventors are thinking every aspect these new driverless cars not only the manufacturing aspect but also the psychological aspects the displays will sustain the driver attention even while they are not actually driving but will turn off the instant the driver needs take over this much safer than what have today because these displays are not something available the majority people who text and drive therefore the new driverless cars will increase safety due their innovative way sustaining the driver attention also the sensors today car have increased safety which shows how sensors the upcoming cars will only increase safety even more some vehicles have sensors and the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone the anti lock brake system has created safer road cognitions due the fact that the sensors the work the driver does not have the driver brakes the information from the sensors alerts the car how much pressure apply and forth thus enabling the car come quicker stop which increases the safety roads this shows how the driverless cars would able all the work for the driver which increases the safety all all driverless cars would make the roads safer place due technological innovation the many positive aspects that the driverless cars would provide would make the world much safer place the next time you don feel like driving think the and coming driverless cars,5
people would say that teachers are the best way showing students how get better understanding subjects like math science etc every student different because not all students learn the same way there away help every student complete and get better understanding every subject the facial action coding system that can read the students facial emotion when there student that getting bord upset when teacher giving lesson the teacher cant just stop what they are doing see what the student upset bord about schools allow students have this kind technology this may allow students get better understanding the lesson student not understanding the lesson they will most likely lower there eye brows and towards each other this shows they dont understand what going this will allow the computer see why the student not understanding bord about than the computer will see this and modify the lesson that the student will understand what going students learning math there computer and they are having trouble understanding what they are doing the computer will see that they need help and will most likely pull yeasayer way solve the problems having school that will allow students use this kind technology may end making yeasayer for the student understand there classwork even homework this will allow the students get better grades and having better understanding the subject later life,3
the united states democracy advertised method achieving selections though this unfortunately not the case the united states individuals are not permitted fair equal opportunity voting systems vote should popular the will the people the nation though through the electoral college the people denied voting far common sense goes the majority rule the electoral college voting system was established during the creation the constitution order secure qualified vote effort diminish the will the lesser unknowing arguably stated that the most thoughtful voters should the ones decide the election other words the statement can easily translated not wish nation idiotic voters decide our president each individual the nation mindful others and care enough express their opinion known citizens duty vote duty that must followed any effort simplify this voter voter they are all qualified person cares enough about their nation cast ballot without requirement they certainly are qualified now that the qualifications are established the electors within the electoral college are free they wish waving magic wand the support others unimportant now and they pull whatever they desire out the hat written bradford plumer consider that state legislatures are technically responsible picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people what happened majority rule people should have the direct vote presidential candidate however are faced with shocking facts such the house selection rarely displaying the correct majority rule the election only few swing voters away from catastrophe the despicable system was established long ago for extremely specific purpose with specific issues which longer the case today the united states are not democracy are republic ridiculously voters not control the election our republic shared over sixty percent voters would prefer direct election can those expect change ironically the system would most like not allow that and those mindful citizens would need hope for glance serendipity,5

the article driverless cars are coming presents the both positive and negative aspects driverless cars the position driverless cars wait for your turn next the driverless car can turned off instantly when driver needs take over the cars not completely driverless yet but improving the car can handle driving functions the sapped mph but drivers have make sure they keeps hold the wheel because like said the first paragraph the cars are not completely driverless yet even though they can steer accelerate and brakes themselves all are design notify the driver when the road ahead requiems human skills this mean human drivers must remained alert and ready take over when the situation requited you mhigh thinking why driverless car still needs driver well because driving lawa focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe and the lawmakers know safety best acheived when there alert driver what for example the technology fails and someone injuried who fault the driver manufacturer this why important have driver this kind situation don worry though because automakers are continuing their work the problems and soon will solved the road waiting for and grow closer the destination everyday this the development the driverless cars,2
dear state senator many people believe that the electoral college should abolished while others believe that the electoral college should stay however what most people who want keep the electoral college not know that when you vote for presidential candidate you are actually voting for slate electors who turn elect the president which means that the people not get direct vote towards the president therefore can cause disinterest people who are eligible vote that why argue favor changing election popular vote for the president the united states the first reason why favor abolishing the electoral college because you can not always trust the electors shown back segregationists the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john kennedy that popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone kennedy also due the winner take all system candidates not spend time states they know they have chance winning obvious that they just want win and you can not trust those candidates especially the people who promise things they know they can not fulfill the electors that the people vote for not want help their state they not even care for the needs the people they are just there for the money another reason why you can not trust the electors because known that the electors can vote for whomever they choose and forget about the people needs one the main reasons why this causes disinterest potential voters the people vote directly for the president they have better chance speaking and fighting for what they want therefore trusting those are some the rights that are taken away the electoral college and people not even realize another reason why believe the electoral college should abolished because the electoral college unfair voters over percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now that more than half the people the government really cared for what the people want the electoral college would have been abolished now studies have shown that only half the people living the have voted the pasts elections you really want the number voters increase and for citizens the express their political preferences you should actually listen them and abolish the electoral college lastly the electoral college prevents voters from controling who they vote for many voters now days believe that when they vote their one vote decides the election but they are wrong they abolish the electoral college the voters would have better chance having who they want for president the people who vote presidential elections are people who want express political preference have more citizens voting the electoral college abolished how you expect for citizens vote and express themselves they are not heard,4
would awesome identify human emotions and knowing what students feel class can really useful think the new technology that reads emotional expressions people can useful schools the teachers will able know when the students are bored the article said classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored let the teacher know the students emotions that the lesson boring the lesson not understandable for them the new technology can help teachers make their plan lessons more fun and understandable and the schools all around the world uses the new technology would lot easier for the teachers make the students more focus school and the lesson but not only the technology can help schools can also help people with their business but that not the point the point that school should start using the new the technology help students stay school and helped them stay focus but not only helps during class time can also help outside school like the student play sports the coches can know when the student sad tired happy angry think having the new technology school can really helpful and useful for everyone but most likely the teacher,3
twenty five years ago spacecraft was taking photos mars while was circling they caught picture face mars the photo went viral and people had their own explication some people thought was aliens some people thought was natural since there sign life mars had something natural there are things called martian mesa martian mesa very common shadows around cydonia but this shadow happen like like face people started believe that there was life mars but that wasn what was going there was life mars there would signs other than shadow done pictures mars before why would something show now there were aliens life mars nasa took picture the face again with camera that was ten times sharper than the original which reveles that there aliens mars was just natural landform people disagree but cydonia hard target hard work and cydonia very common natural shadowing mars and most likely other places too some people still have their disbelief but research has shown natural landform that very common around cydonia,3
future cars with advantage can you imagine time the future when one buys cars because one needs them anymore course the future cars going way more better than the cars today the cars that sergey brin will makes would use half the fuel today taxis and will far more flexibility than bus even though too expensive worth how much smarter can the cars have postion estimating sensors the left rear wheel video camera near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor but the most important one out all that the spinning senor the roof safe and fun people can use video camera when they trip use gps when they lost needed somewhere that they don know this what call good life why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver because more fun and safer and safety big concern most driving law focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe further improvements sensors and computer hardware and software make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more and more driving tasks their own worry about safety anymore future cars have way more advantage than the cars now not needed much need today flexibility than bus having video camera mounted near the rearview mirror also provides more safety which big concern less accident fun and gps what need more,2
personally think that for once lifetime america and when say america mean the people our nation should able elect presidents the united states popular votes know some you questioning yourselves why would say something like that and that reason because know there people arguing here our society about their beliefs why one person should become president and another arguing why one should become president the passage reads under the ammendment the constitution the district columbia allocated electors and treated like state for purposes the electoral college but you ask saying and asking you other words the congress why you guys have through all this just get president election and have president the united states just some things the world have gone though are totally dramatic and this the very first thing person going say the world very corrupt place nowadays but eyes say that the world can become better place the people cooperate togther and stop trying always slice eachother throats about stupid reasoning over dumb presidential election that the house representatives have put togther and now they want act they had par take the action going think the people our own should able vote roure own president and not have congress put there who they think fit for the position being president state this because the one who always look peaches and cream aint always sugar they say things the campaigns get americans either sides but when vote for that one who said going stop this and that and then when get the chair being president they don nothing all say let america vote for own presidency and not the people,1
the article making mona lisa smile the author introduces new form technology the facial action coding system the new technology allows computers identify human emotions the use this technology will not valuable students classroom because will expensive communication skills will lost and technology not always accurate now without this new technology some schools barely have enough money buy basic supplies needed provide proper education for the students the facial action coding system facs added the classrooms will another expense that not neccessary the passage says your home cant handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisas smile this statement imply that order use facs the school will have buy not only the software but also new computers that will support the system that lot money spent unneccessary items when could spent the basic supplies that most schools can barely provide now today world communication skills are bad enough already with the current technology that students are surrounded each day the passage states classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor the new technology added into the classroom and point taking the place teacher communication skills will further taken away teachers teach more than just science math english the students having teacher the classroom also teaches students how communicate properly with adults and how carry mature conversations taking away that human interaction will have negative effect the students technology not always accurate this software makes appearance classrooms and students start using could give false information the paysage states weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions vinci masterpiece each expression compared against neutral face showing emotion each person face compared the exact same neutral face which will not accurate each person has different neutral face order for the information correct will need compared against each person neutral face there are multiple reasons that the new software will not beneficial students the classroom however there are couple reasons that the technology will valuable the passage says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts the computers telling the teacher that the student confused could beneficial because most students will not tell the teacher they are confused which causes them get bad grades they not understand the material the teacher knows that the student confused they can take actions make sure that they help them understand later the passage says empathy feeling someone elses emotional state may happen because unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions the new technology could help students understand and have empathy which will good thing lots people not have lot empathy today world which part the reason why the world very cold place students having empathy could result everyone treating each other better they can try understand the things that their peers are feeling overall facs will cause people more trouble and headaches than anything after considering both sides the argument safe say that the new technology will not beneficial students the classroom because the combination being expensive taking away communication skills and not always being accurate,5

the challenge exploring venus talks about the different aspects and dangers venus tells what have learned and what have been trying accomplish since scientists and nasa from earth first attempted land spacecrafts over three decades ago the question venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the author the challenge exploring venus supports this idea using facts about earth and newly learned facts about venus what have done further investigate this planet according this article the challenge exploring venus have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world the author reports that not one spacecraft lasted more than few hours luckily sent the missions unmanned says this the main reason why one has tried explore further although this setback still continue work towards learning more about venus the evening star coming with different ideas for example from the article could hover over the planet safe distance but still struggle land and bring back samples why venus dangerous well according the author the article the challenge exploring venus paragraph not only covered thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide but the planets surface over degrees fahrenheit which where live can get average degrees fahrenheit from what have experienced that almost nine times hot and would kill most living things that land there you think about that based the authors facts also due atmospheric pressure being high those together mentioned paragraph line crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquefy many metals which makes this planet not only dangerous but inhospitable why are addicted learning and exploring this planet why won leave venus according the author this article often referred earth twin most people who have learned about the solar system would know this neighbor planet the closest planet earth terms density and size the author even says that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth most scientists just want learn more about the planets that surround the world live conclusion venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents according the author the challenge exploring venus supports this idea does this using facts about earth and newly learned facts about venus also stresses the point that shouldn let danger stop saying paragraph our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,4

would you planet just see how works many people may say but some will say yes venus very interesting planet with many extreme cirumstances venus the second closest planet the sun but yet hotter than the first closest planet which mercury the closest the sun would great idea study venus beaus eof these reasons and more staring off the people studying venus must know the dangers the planet itself the passage says the planets surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater that what experience our own planet this explains just two the hazards venus brings the table another thing the carbon dioxide blankets the planet this means that only can oxygen but most likely the percentage lot less although the hazards are high the ways overcome are greater nasa possible plan the hostile conditions venus surface they are planning make blimp like vehicle that hovers miles above the roiling venusian landscape this will keep the men and woan studying high and dry meaning they will out the hazards elements but close enought learn what they need the conditions are survivable but not all that luxurious temperatures would around degrees fahrenheit and the pressure would the same earth sea level furthermore explaining their equipment they are working many things like improving mechanical computers electronics made silicon carbide using the mechanical computer approach the equipment will more durable than regular computer laptop phone the simplified electronics have been tested simulating chamber set like the extremes venus and have lasted three weeks using simulators will make the conditions less foreign and give understanding what the people will endure the study conclusion there are many reasons why safe venus and learn these are just few examples nasa working more thing keep these explorers safe venus does have harsh climate and hazards conditons but the reward will outweigh the risks dayday many things will made help with the safety the exploration ask you this would you for the tasks given the still present risks,3
unmasking the face mars come over here quick told nasa crew members told them that had found something scientist nasa discussing the face that another scientist thinks was created aliens told them they all came and was wondering what needed them for and found clues think found parts the face that not aliens states one the scientist nasa didn find anything unusual except that there may more than one the faces many the scientist are starting wonder this face was created aliens scientists have tooke camera over and there alien monument after all but how you get the others believe thats theres not not everyone was satisfied the face mars located degress north latitude the camera they had been using had peer through wispy clouds see the face they said the aliens marks may have been hidden haze but some didn even think that their were aliens marking and said that just natural landform but then again how could they prove april mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time ever michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper than the orginal photos many anxious web surfers were waiting for the first image appear their screens all they got was natural landform sign alien transformation lastly nasa had many images for web surfer see the caption that they had noted underneath was huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion the eyes nose and mouth the authors reasoned that would good way engage and attract the public attentions mars what the picture was actually showing was the martian equivalent mesa landform which was common around the american west reminds many people the middle butte the snake river plain midohio thats lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same size the face mars,2
this idea could good because students could get there lesson different way that makes them learn better another way could good because the computer would tell the teacher you are confused bored with the lesson they are teaching could also help the teacher and telling you you are happy sad this system could the solution come kids were looking for this would good idea have classrooms because will different way learning paragraph talks about how the computer could modify the lesson will like actual teacher this will good because some people dont learn the way there teicher teaches and they had this will make learning easier for those kids also those kids wont bored the way there teacher teaches the wll more interested there topic they are learning about next another way this will good will tell the teacher you are confused bored with the way she teaching and will modify your lesson will help you learn the best way that for you paragraph says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored this good because the teacher could try and change the way she teaching this will make better for the students because the teacher changes then there attitudes will the student will actually enjoy the lesson and not bored confused another way the system will help will tell you you are happy sad tells the teacher your happy sad then they will know what help you lastly paragraph says imagine computer that knows when you happy sad the system could that then the teacher will know not give you hard time the computer knows that then they will know give you some time cool and gain composure all schools had computers like tihs kids will have better grades and not bored and confused class like kids are now the teachers could use show they are not having good mood they need change the way they teaching there students having computer like this school could good idea because will tell you need learn different way will tell you you are confused bored what the teacher teaching about and will tell the teachers there students are happy sad some people need this they can have better grades and days school,4
autonomous cares have been dreamt for several generations now theyre gone through multiple changes and theories but just now found one solution that may the key the next generations cars tech company google revealed that was working self driven car however despite this being the works for over years still has its faults some are sceptical about its rise being the new standard however see differently many people believe that these autonomous cars are highly dangerous the public this not true the self riven car from google has only witnessed one crash its lifespan that crash was caused another driver given this information true that car should have been able have counter manoeuver this everyone were using car like this the motherland there would need for these types manoeuvers take place now others will think the cars completely impractical todays society but this fact false the autonomous vehicles will only consume roughly half the fuel today meaning will cut back our dependence for fossil fule such gasoline since they dont require driver most situations will allow the driver multitask while the car which will great benefit given todays busy world better still that they come equiped with high grade sensors sense oncoming dangers and can move speed needs without having the attention the person inside for the autonomous cars absolutely with the cut fossil fuels and the safety thats provided when one who would want them stop they will make everyday life more simplistic and much more safe,4
opinion limiting the usage cars would great some people use there vilches for the stupidest reasons when they could walk even ride bike would better for our enviroment and even people some advantages limiting car usage would cleaner air and people would get excercise alright who wants town and smell the nasty fumes car not would love smell the fresh air when you limit the usage cars this could happen not only would you vae clean air but the people around you would satisfied with the results according the article car free day spinning into big hit bogota they claim its good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution with this being said happier people may give people chance get job even have better enviroment around addition people could get excercise from limiting car usage when people get excercise means the obesity levels can down and make the place better for everyone also from people having activity they dint have sit there butt anymore they can actually get and attemps find job benefit their family and the community conclusion people can benefit from this car usage rule from having cleaner and get exercise those all play factor each other,3
many scientists and astronomers might ask exploring venus worth the risk this might question that asked all around the world some people may find visiting venus too dangerous others really don mind the challenge the real question nasa really going conduct this unnecessary experiment the author seems like she for exploring venus paragraph the author gives exceptional reasons why venus worthy pursuit also the narrator seems like she for sending humans explore venus throughout the whole article the author favor this idea well old friend mine always said everything not what seems the author idea visiting venus valued but too risky paragraph states venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit astronomers are fascinated venus because its most earth like planet the solar system paragraph the article says nasa has compelling idea for sending humans study venus additionally all this evidence supports claim the mission venus will most likely very deadly after reading this article nasa supports this idea despite the dangers some scientists need push the idea that everything not meant for exploring stated the article venus has thick atmosphere carbon dioxide and over degrees fahrenheit does that sound safe you,2
since google has been developing driverless cars cofounder google sergey brin believes that with these cars would fundamentally change the world more than million people have roven the cars without any accidents but that driverless car isnt fully driverless still requires the driver take over some points agree that driverless cars are the best new cars the future that should accepted google should work make this car available the public around the world because this new generation depends technology this new technology also makes people feel safer while driving the road the passage says toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the combination all this input necessary for the driverless car mimic the skill human the wheel the cars are programmed human actions which may guarantee fewer accidents and crashes regardless humans should still pay attention because the driverless car cant everything navigating through work zones and around accidents this means the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires driverless cars are still very dependable makes driving alot easier googles new creation driverless cars gold mind great way get consumers attention and more money for the company although the car cant certain things can most things that cars toda cant sebastian thrun founder the google car project believes that technology has finally begun catch the dream the new driverless car may change the future cars,3
you think that the face was created aliens well think the face just land form but thats how feel about don believe that aliens are real the other hand you might think they are real and don blame you because when was little thought they was real all the movies was watching about aliens taking over ect although few scientists believed the face was alien artifact photographing they photographed the face soon they could get good shot april cloudless summer day cydonia mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look when they had did they pixel the image spams meters they image was not face anymore was really maritain equivalent butte masa reminds the middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin finally now you see that there were aliens mars and they aliens are not real was just the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms now with all this information just gave you you should believe now,2
don think need driverless cars just makes humans even more lazy and probably waste resources well time position driverless cars are they are not needed just the fact that one needs have paragraph seven states the car can handle functions speeds twenty five mph but special touch sensors make sure that driver keeps hold the wheel this statement basically states that the car can only twenty five mph but you have holding the wheel for this your basically just sitting there just goes the only thing your not working the gas you would have watch just because you were have work between work zones accidents the most important thing for driver car safely this car pose help that part out using cameras watch the driver and the road they were function break how would you get another one would you able buy them the store pay for them again from the company also the technology the car were fail while the driver distracted worst and someone were get injuried who held charge for will the driver face the charge the manufactures who made not mention doing all this stuff once how much gas can for one mile are trying build cars that can farther and not have that much gas what will the mileage this car that can drive itself will run off batteries fossil fuels something that doesn harm the environment this ends position driverless cars the road think not good idea based off the fact that came this far driving cars without them driving for anything like can without cars driving themselves what need focus can improve how far car goes with just one gallon gas improving their mph this would help people farther without the cost gas would slow down the rate resources going down and help our environment,3

like this feature consider very helpful both computers and robots regarding robots wonder bayman from disney big hero had something like was like robotic nurse explained the main character however wouldn work concrete tunnels regarding computers the feature could have come out bit sooner then nickelodeon could used for non animated show they came out with called frankie still waiting for the show continue one the last two episodes this show one the judges for this competition that was like quiz show said that computers can feel human emotions but girl who was part computer proved her wrong like this show because gives proof how smart computers are conclusion this feature should used all computers like for used robots too that way robots could take the expression and mimic pretty sure the transformers movies have something like too the transformers movies and big hero use then was probably already thought with computers someone could type into the computer how feeling today and the computer could respond with emotion like said computer has esp,2

whoever thought that making faces could reveal much about the science emotions nick alto having the technology read student emotions class not valuable because would cost fortune and would distraction the software detect the emotions students would too expensive and that makes the facial action coding system not valuable your home can handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile nick alto most schools have standard home computers class which means the school will spend fortune replace the old computers with new and more powerful computers after replacing the computers schools will still have buy the facial action coding system which will most like cost alot money that could used for other things another reason the facial action coding system not valuable because would distraction classroom empathy feeling someone else emotional state may happen because unconsciously imitate another person facial expressions nick alto after being told one student emotion the other students that class will unconsciously feel that emotion and distracting them for their lesson the facial action coding system not valuable schools because distraction and would cost fortune install there need for computer tell student emotion class,3
imagine that you are scientist nasa the man that you worked with was photographer mars the man comes trapper keeper walking down towards your office shows you the photographs that took when was outerspace the planet mars noticed something about the picture and tells you look and ask you what you see you tell him that you see figure that looks like face then agrees with you you start jump conclusions and ask made aliens just regular landform few days later nasa unveiled the image for everyone see the note the paper was stated huge rock formation they are passing around the picture for everyone see one the workers had assumed was made formed alien you and couple your workers were talking and assumed that was just regular landform and changed the years went the manager had did little debate they thought was made alien they would have one side and they thought was just natural landform that going change the years they would have the other side the people nasa that thought was alien artifact had explain and describe why one them volunteered and said that they think made alien because there way that just going change through the years you interrupt him and say that possible because many things change over the years policies laws taxes and many more things you explain them that not made alien becuase the photographer viking and viking goes around and takes pictures the planet circles around then they noticed something different about the figure when the picture was shown the people that your side agree with you and say that you are true they ask for more evidence make your statement better than what was you tell them that what the picture really shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west you and the workes take the last look the picture and you are amazed the years goes you see that the face doesnt appear anymore the pictures from the time started the time ends,3
the ways emotions work the way are feeling that exact moment may feel sad depressed angry happy excited just fantastic emotions how express ourselves emotions can with lot things love care affection ect emotions just how people coupe with things like depression things like that facs facial action coding system can tell how people emotions are how they are feeling that moment the system can just look you tell you how you are feeling but percentages can sad depressed hungry thats how their scanners work their technology like best the world klimke very tech this matter for thm see how you are feeling very amazing can magnificent things this world once you learn everything you can about their facial scanners you can turn that frown upside down,1
the author described about the computer system and the author wrote about huang realizes the work psychologist such paul eckman creator facs facial action coding system and paul has classified six basic emotions happiness suprise anger disgust fear and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements the facial muscles the author wrote the fact human for distance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face and huang observes that artists such vinci studied human anatomy thep them paint facial muscles precisely enough convey specific emotions his new computer software stores similiar anatomical information electronic code the mona lisa demonstration really intended bring smile your face while shows just how much this computer can and the author wrote the definition and some examples how imagine computer can describes human feelings the last thing the theory emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them whoever thought that making faces could reveal much about the science emotions,1
the world there are people who believe aliens supernatural beings while some not the face mars example occurance that causes people believe aliens supernatural beings even though this true there are still many people who think the landform natural occurance there are ways prove that this theory for the landform true reasons such the landform being compared natural earth landforms and has similar characteristics earth landforms help prove this true the landform was compared butte messa this means quite similar earthly landforms and may have occured due something that happened mars the face mars compared one main earth landform that was mentioned the landform middle butte which located the snake river plain idaho was lava dome that took the form isolated mesa the face mars had the same look and height earth landform mesa true that there unusual shape the face mars there are similar occurance that happen earth though this happens earth people don say that these earth landforms were made aliens this landform just like other occurance seperate planets that resemble earth landforms even though the landform resembles human face doesn mean the landform alien doing just like landforms earth there are more ways than one prove the reason the starting place landform,3
the effects greenhouse gas emission began take their toll the earth atmosphere simply its own natural output time has gone though and humans and their ways transportation have evolved greenhouse gas emission becoming more problem automobiles mainly cars play huge role the production nasty fumes and gases that become trapped the atmosphere for example europe passenger cars make twelve percent total greenhouse gas emission and heavily congested areas such the united states can skyrocket fifty percent some nations countries are beginning take new approach battle the war greenhouse gases studies have shown that national driving levels and the amount people purchasing cars and earning their licenses are dropping after their peak people are more and more willing put down the car keys and put their running shoes one these places particular the city vauban and located germany middle class upper class community and its citizens can considered pioneers suburbia vauban does not permit driving limits besides the main thoroughfare and few side streets car owners buy space for their car for alongside home while some might argue about the practicality not driving your car you have one shown extremely beneficial not only for the environment but for people well when you outside whether you headed somewhere just casual stroll you may reach nirvana you enjoy the true sounds nature places where cars are permitted drive you might hear the sound birds chirping outside your window the calm rustle leaves rustling the wind but the rumbles roars and honks car are not far behind areas such vauban the beautiful sounds the world won drowned out greasy hunk steel besides feeling peace life without car healthier life now when you want somewhere you must rely your own two feet those two feet bicycle skateboard etc will all you need get where you going unlike many places though everything within walking distance for convenience and encourage you take these steps notice the physical and emotional changes yourself once place with cars you feel more relaxed less rushed and your body will thank you,4
many people have tried predict what are other people feelings with look their face but usually are not always correct can even describe what are feeling well their software that can tell what people feelings are with just look their face which called facial action coding system facs this software can read different kinds faces imagines and real people like students classrooms think worth the value using this technology read students emotional expressions the famous painting mona lisa shows kind actual emotional expression but the software can pick different kinds emotions she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry paragraph all that could not describe without the machine and knowing that the machine works they can use students classrooms teachers don usually know when students are confused bored having other emotions they can use those softwares classrooms classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored paragraph that way teachers know what when students ethier confused bored that new technology will help teachers and students schools usually students don tell the teacher getting confused bored and think that great way use the value that technology students classrooms conclusion the facial action coding system facs would help with teachers and students classrooms work more together think that this new technology worth read students emotional expressions,3
when you look these pictures what you see may face some people and others might just natural landform never really know the truth unless somebody goes there since its been while may not even there anymore you went there would you come back with false true evidence help support what you think may the text say twenty five years ago something funny happened around mars nasa viking spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos possible landing sites for its sister ship viking when spotted the shadowy likeness human face enormous head nearly two miles from end end seemed starring back the cameras from region the red planet called cydonia this shows that this two mile long human face was real this must had been giant living mars the text also says scientist figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh this shows that this helps know that could just been martian mesa since its common around cydonia the image can see where they see the face but then look the picture from just looks like large landform yes could decayed but then the time come should have already been decayed and you would thought that from image from the mesa was human face then wouldn really have all those cracks like the image from has the text says few days later nasa unveiled the image for all see what kind raucous you think this would caused the text says few days later nasa unveiled the image for all see the caption noted huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth this shows that they might added the resembles human face because they can really put was unless somebody actually went mars many people would have had there different opinions were really human face without the resembles human head part not the authors who wrote the story about the resembles human head thought would good way have the public engage attention toward mars did the text says the face mars has since become pop icon has starred hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows this shows that the face mars popular even though couldn real human head,3
agree with the statement saying that should use this technology emotional expressions because could help people with knowing what gong with the person personal life even though kids would not like should brought use because there can anymore repression into kids life first reason why think should use technology like this because says that even though individuals often sho varying degrees expression like not smiling broadly this means that start using this type technology can figure out person good bad another reason why should use this technology because says course most would have trouble actually describing each facial trait taht conveys happy worried etc this could mean that even you might know what they feel you could most possible wrong because they look happy that does not mean they are actually happy they could sad the inside their body then finally last reason they used the mona lisa smile demonstration then said the mona lisa demonstration really intended bring smile your face imagine computer that knows when you happy sad this means this technology can detect you are actually happy sad conclusion agree with this kind technology because can help people understanding other people feelings could also demonstration how fast time going technology also what technology can nowadays,2
have you ever thought was good idea have driverless cars the world think there are positive and negative things about this but agree more the positive side things how would you feel relax while you the road how would you feel was finally legal your phone while you the drivers seat the car think brillant idea having driverless cars like said you could relax while the road you could the phone while the car also think this would great idea for people whos job make deliveries such ups and fedex drivers this also would great idea for people who travel lot and people who travel far distances think more states and car companies should more open about this idea they should open this idea because all the good things that can come out especially idea that already has prototype more states should allow google test their driverless cars also lawmakers have open about this idea because this could possibly our future other companies such bmw nissan tesla audi and mercedes benz should team have meeting and create the first ever street legal driverless car all those companies have great cars also all those companies have something unique about their cars they all work together know they could create safe driverless car then they prove lawmakers that driverless cars could half million miles without crashing maybe lawmakers might make legal and maybe more states would open having them what you think about the safety driverless cars you think driverless cars are too risky dangerous you think that lawmakers need make driverless cars legal you think those certain states are over thinking what could the future think driverless cars would great idea hopefully the future could come agreement about driverless cars,2
our fellow citizens the advantage limiting car usage allows citizens able save money for smart planning for example source states that the united states seperate suburban life from auto use component movement called smart planning smart planning allows citizens able walk the places have there are residents that live within rectangle square mile away from store but instead have those that rather drive car and waste not only there gas but the money they could using for other things the other hand france they use diesel fuel which was making percent their vehicles compared regular gas thats makes percent western europe bogata columbia they took many other ways travel and get the places they wanted which did not cause much traffic jams during that time they made goal the time promote alternative transportation and reduce the smog after bogata columbia started that other places such valledupar and cali joint the even that was taking place other places developed places park the sidewalk you walk were even made smooth traffic was longer contested america the car rates are starting decrease for example souce talks about how obama ambitions curve the greenhouse gas were unveiled since the gas prices has risen high their are fewer people buying cars the driving rate has went back down where use also says that the car rates went down because most people are not able purchase cars some people rather walk around take public transporation car pool with others because the rates gas are getting higher and higher younger people driving has decreased younger people behind the wheel are risk anything could happen improve safety the have created transportation most states you het bus car pool plane and walk just get the places that you need conclusion limiting car usage better way save money and also safer way for you travel,3
all our development since world war has been centered the car and that will have change you know what are some the risks car intensive areas well passenger cars are the responsible for percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states there many ways reduce car pollution for example said source paris bans driving due smog congestion was down percent the capital france paris after days near record pollution because paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city but paris isn the only one who making change shows source car free day spinning into big hit bogota bogota has given new beginning with the implementation program the day without cars which cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for both cities the weather spread out good changes and reduce drastically car pollution but why limited car usage important well there many reasons get benefits beause for instance suburbs are becoming more compact and more accessible public transportation also this new approach stores are placed walk away main streets rather than malls along some distant highway therefore pedestrian bicycle private cars commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety remember driving vanity not priority,2
think having facial action coding system classroom very valuable there are many positive outcomes having the room with the children can help student counselors for school with this technology can help just about all the students school think this would very useful thing for classroom how can help classroom lets say teacher noticed student that was having bad day looked down general the teacher would then send them computer use the facial action coding system help see how the student feeling the teacher can then send the student counselor discuss how the student feeling using the technology the computer paragraph said that the computer could recognize when student bored confused with lesson student the best day the computer would recognize and the student can helped out with his her situation thats when the student would sent talk someone about whats going with them conclusion strongly think that having facial action coding system classroom would very useful can make teacher and student counselors job times easier may cost the school some money for the technology but would totally worth,3
driver feel that transportation very important when getting your destination and feel that can improved but also feel that the driverless car not the way for one the driverless car not even driverless you still need driver and questions the safety the driver and those the car first all the car still requires driver which are talking about driverless car useless the text states that the car will notify the driver when shift gears and take over the navigating when driving through work zones and around accidents doing not actual driverless car still has notify the driver switch gears drive this also leads second point which questions the driver safety said that the car will notify the driver when drive with vibration that being given off his her seat therefore not knowing feeling the vibration alert the driver the are going switch gears drive the car can lead major car accident that being said not the best idea carry out this experiment involving the driverless car since not actually driverless car and questions the safety the people the car,3
dear senator the electoral college very outdated and confusing most american voters believe their votes elect the president even though they really don truth american voters are electing electors that instead the district columbia and vote the new president instead infuriating this sounds seeing most americans want direct vote president elected popular vote not entirely bad but isn the best election system the electoral college system that should stay most americans that are angered and upset when they realize their vote doesn have much say they though are usually the ones who fight abolish the electoral college while this true also accurate most people don even know that they aren even voting for the president and their vote only electing their state electors upsetting that mostly just like choosing new senator representative represent the state this the same idea our state votes for number people vote for win the democratic side democrats will vote for the democrat they rarely betray candidate while the winner takes all system unfair those who not agree with the side the state chose overall provides clear system clearly elect new president candidates always try persuade states softening visiting them sway them vote for electors that will elect them instead looking the results safe say the electoral college upsetting can voting system that should stay until can find better one abolishing the system might make more direct vote but the electoral college organized sincerely student,3
being seagoing cowboy awesome when your over sea you can all kinds stuff you can feed the horses clean the stalls and when all the horses are dropped off you can have some fun basically you can anything you want think you should become seagoing cowboy when the horses are around pretty easy job all you have feed them water them and clean the stalls simple you feed the horses hay and oats give them fresh water and clear their stalls every weeks pretty easy job you grew farm being boat have make stops along the way that when you can sight seeing our last trip were going geese stopped venice italy saw all kinds cool stuff took granola ride down the streets water but when all the work done and are all our way back america that when the fun begins the other cowboys and all kinds stuff play baseball table tennis fencing boxing reading whittling and other games pass time sometimes even play volleyball the empty horse stalls its lot fun being seagoing cowboy with big orders for horses might hard but there are some small orders which are real easy all all fun job sometimes the trip long sometimes the trip short but still the greatest job the world think job could any better you should come and join seagoing cowboy,3
think that was real face why you ask because that could been life form and that could been were fell down where else would face the moon sand like that for reason like contol sanders always says its finger lickin good thats why theres face there the moon ancient tribes could lived there before even discovered the moon orbiting around the planet earth the first place there are many theros about the moon expected think that any reason could legitimist when kernal sanders made kfc didnt suspect thing just made ton chicken with reason stop and think thats just like way inscribing any way possible when you were not alive long ago because you didnt have the technology even try see there were anyone the moon the first place think saying mabe the didnt even breath the oxygen they could just breathe space seems imposible know but mabe the kind life the moon didnt need food water air think that every type answer can judged the way sounds but there many ways could happen like mabe before was the moon was planet with life just like earth with water food and resources stay alive point time long ago but when smashed into earth all its compounds switched impact burning every living thing the moon and making things for the earth reason that god made life but when did made life the moon but eventually died out before our time and leaving soulless moon for the earth smash into billion years ago creating earth and life humanity and the world when the found the face the moon they were just then finding out that the moon may have contained life long ago although might not happened how explained there might been another way life its self the moon think could been rational way but will never know untill the end time there was life created the earth just the same way little time ago when the face showed was unbelievable,1
what time alive have many new inventions that have changed our lifes for the good and for the fun there one new technological advancement that could change our lives entirely the self driving car the self driving car car that well does what sounds like drives its self although there are many positive aspects for this new invention here talk about the bad this new technological advancement should not developed because the driver would still have alert the technology fails who blame and just pricey would suck you were car that can drive itself but you still had there alert the self driving cars requires you there constantly holding the wheel you are the wheel already why shouldn you just drive the car yourself plus the car can only move faster than mph tend faster than that you might well yourself also would like your waiting for your turn drive you would only getting the car drive risky dangerous situations lastly would get boring waiting there your car with your hands the wheel say you got into crash who blame you take your eyes off the road for split seong and bang your self driving car just crashed into another car the fault yours was the cars see make these cars would have make new laws whos blame also wouldnt safe for pedestrians and you the systems fail you could crashing into something someone without warning the best way ensure someones safety with human driver behind the wheel most people wouldnt even able afford self driving car the first place and when these cars come out the average american wouldnt able afford with all that technology and the car would most likely double the price cars not increase drastically also will cost lot money send satellites space map our cities and countries the money send these comes form these are some the reasons why shouldn make self driving cars you would still have there sitting the wheel alert case something happens who fault would you crashed yours the cars lastly the price make sell and send satellites space would much also the best way ensure someones safety with human driver behind the wheel not computers,4
well first off paul eckman created sytem called facs which creates affects and changes human facial expressions for better results this allows new form technology change emotions and more this software can identify emotions just like that opinion think that there need for this system identify facials expressions students because first are young you know when are angry happy sad because tend show like body language older people and even people age know when there something wrong with one another because you can tell how they usally are from how they are that moment don get wrong like what paul came with this type science and technology but dont think neccessary change pictures and add emotions something just think using this technology these students wouldn much but tell you whether not there sad angry happy confused excited and etc however this technology shouldn waste mean you can use this technology other ways like animas you can really tell whether animal happy sad and etc but far like the whole idea just not the type experiment paul trying accomplish his technology that has created outstanding and pretty shore can find something else use for like said you don need computer read humans face body langauge,2
not for against driverless cars driverless cars opinion have impact people are for against them then that cool really don care driverless cars will just add onto the list how lazy for would think pretty cool have driverless cars simply because show how far advanced technology driverless cars could benefit and hazard depending when where they would distributed will probably take another few years before able just sit back and relax our car takes our destination without having pay attention because lot things but the biggest factor would humans will while before technology can react like humans there are bunch carless drivers who have normal cars how would the computers react would they break happy and keep pumping the breaks every other second avoid accident would they just continue and cause accident would driverless cars like requirement every vehicle has have computer can drive itself that would safe would cause less accidents for people who like drink their troubles away and get drunk every other minute would prevent lots problems the road for those who text and drive who just don pay attention know didn write this how was supposed and really don care sorry but education means little nothing least typed that much though right,1
the artifical driverless cars are coming against the development these care the driverless cars wil make everyone lazier and more carefree then what already are this world driers today are already getting into many accidents while driving becasue they are not paying attention what going around them they are intoxicated they get distracted easy all need learn how keep our eyes the road all times chillout depending something someone for believe that should stick the cars already have and just pay more attention whats going around the driverless car not completely driverless now who say will the future the driverless car smart and tells you when you about back into something someone and they also help you know when danger coming the driverless cars not however drive you safely where you need want they still require have teh drivers full attention all times for when there danger ahead work zone they are not completely driverless that was the casse then wouldn have pay attention still what going around and the cars wouldn need warning lights the dashboard vibrating seats any camera senser incat with what going around that very moment honestly best option don think have the best technology yet even begain trying creat driverless cars like see movies have been trying creat the same cars see the movies becasue like the idea about not having physically drive anywhere ourselves and would much rather have machine other factor for since google has been working ideas creat these said driverless cars and have yet fully suceed creating one that doesnt require anyone drive them any point time should just messing around with technology and what think may may not happen the future and focuses what happening right now our lives and what have came across adn discovered right now conclusion everything have said and pointed out everyone entitles their own opinion and what they think true not true and what should happen the near future but should just stick everything that know and what are learning now rather then changing the way things are with todays world and when have far more advanced technology them possible try figure out should have driverless cars what should,4
technology has come long way from when first began not only does have positive outcomes also very helpful this new era technology for example some individuals find very hard express themselves verbally and emotionally today world with new invention that could help one express oneself emotions could become much easier handle teacher may find hard make their students engage learning computer being able read the emotional expressions students one the positive outcomes that could not only help the teachers but the students well student was having trouble expressing and explaining thier feelings they would want some sort way out this mean that such computer was used individual understand what they feel expressing emotions would much easier teachers not only have teach certain subject they also have find way make their students get engaged and make connection with them help them understand paul eckman created facs facial action coding system associating emotions with the characteristic movements the facial muscles this system was used students teacher would have better understanding how students feel during certain subject exercise although others may argue that with this sytem being used one might not feel safe internally mentally because their emotions would constantly tracked computer where anyone can see they must see the positive outcomes that may follow using this procedure for example many people struggle with understanding algebra equations literary questions with the help this new system scientists could decode all emotions that did not even know existed,3
some people think that the face was made aliens well tell you right here right now that the face you are looking not made aliens but just natural cause will giving you many reason why this thing the moon has sign even remotely have anything with aliens one reason that find this face created nature because even the earth has these kind landforms just look some the mountains just really zoomed out there were aliens why wouldn they made more defined mean make something want look real can make and you look closely you can tell that aliens did make why did they make bad like just nature looks beautiful but something such aliens made this sorry but they did very poorly because they can make pyramids look pretty they then think they can manage face some sort place such the moon there also another reason that say there way the aliens made how can the pyramids stay together well they did but the face the moon fell apart with that short time mean look from looks like bomb went off and thats only years what would look like even years besides dont have any hard core evidence that aliens actually exist when they show some hard core hands down evidence that can look and say wow you opened eyes now see what you have been talking about untill then will always believe that the face the moon was just natural cause and that mother nature made that face,2
strongly against the idea driverless cars feel that the generations come grow using driverless cars not only will they not develope the proper driving skills needed the take control ove dangerous situations such heavy traffic and people passing the streets but they wil think its okay leave completely inanimate object control their lives stated paragraph smart cars not completely drive themselves and they require human driver take control the wheel from time time but passengers are long road trip they are stuck traffic for vexatious amounts time they may become tired and think that sleeping okay because the car can drive itself wrong who say the traffic won randomly pick and require assistance from human driver what unexpected pedestrian runs across the street and the smart car doesn sense slow down and the innocent passerby crushed cars should have fully focused driver control all times deadly accidents happen daily basis that include machinery gone wrong program crashing causing equipment fail who say the same thing won happen with smart cars what goif happen manu fracturing company made one small mistake while developing one these smart cars that causes them all crash there answer these horrifying possibilities but there easy solution smart cars should illegal because they endanger the lives our loved ones and create large hazard for every civilian who happens walking anywhere near these smart cars,3
the computer software which has been invented test the emotion people but not really good way test people like that you want understand the people thinking when they have emotion why don you learn ecology the program tested mona lisa smile and the result said percent happy percent disgusted artist painted character which really beautiful but just make that character emotion really happy and wants shows the audience beautiful girls with joyful face when the computer software test the emotions character and shows these results will really disappointed these results way more too accurately can ruined one artist someone else life the computer learned things way more faster than all major muscles the model must move like human muscles from facs the program will detected the six basic motions happiness suprise anger disgust fear and sadness well that not going accurate from the example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you surprised this surprise emotion just opinion the creator paul eckman can tired and showing that emotion too when the computer testing the students the class there are many emotions the class but even they express their emotion still not fair enough prove what thoughts they have classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored this point the computer testing everyone emotion but remember study not fun normally that you will get bored someone have happy face the classroom that means crazy distracted other stuff useless testing the student emotions the class indeed the ecology better than the program can looks through other peoples emotion our eyes and communicate with them you will still understand their emotion because have our brain calculate the article making mona lisa smile mentioned humans perform ths same impressive calculation everyday and than give example inform the human calculation more precisely even though concession still shows not necessary use this kind technology predict people emotions addition the computer which created man still from the human acknowledgement human data base which brain but can limited the testing area like the emotion that predict wrong altough can test through the muscle changing still can not prove the true feeling the human the reason why have ecology this courses because people brain way more better than the computer computer fast but based human knowledge also use there way creat perfect program everyone has different opinion the creator the program not really valuable use this kind technology read student emotional expressions,3
there are some big conversations and conspiracy the face mars one the many conspiracies theories though some say alien landform natural land form either way think natural linformation people many have strong theory but many not always make sence the face mars total natural linformation nasa scientist have not found any signs aliens the planet mars the article states that not many scientists believe that there was alien artifacts mars scientists also say that hard track cydonia and get clear image the face the face has natural linformation because most the wierd landforms earth may look like ancient aliens did but was not scientists have not proved that aliens are real and that all weirdly amazing artifacts are from them aliens are not real although there are shows about them being real but those are all conspiracies the conspiracies may look real and sound real but they are just trying get people attention hear them out and convince them that aliens are real scientists say that our minds are stagnated find faces objects see all kinds shapes the cloudy sky because our minds are trained that the face mars just one the many things that can find face natural linformation the article states that the landforms are also common near the american west earth garvin says reminds moser middle butte the snake river plain idaho that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars conclusion there are big conversations about the face mars some many think ancient alien formation but others say natural linformation scientist have hard time tracking down cydonia and also taking pictures the face aliens have not been proven out outerspace therefore can not alien formation this face mars natural formation because there are similar linformation earth near the american west and also idaho whether alien formation natural one saying that the face mars just another natural fannon,4
there are several reasons for which not belive the process the electoral collage first all the system which the goverment presides internally corrupt under the voters votes not count even the entire state votes for one candidate the person representing the state may choose say that the other candiate won therefore messing the actual count saying that all the people that particular state voted for singular candiate now lets real state going entirely vote for single candidate but lets say that obama count for florida was instead the supposedly was obama would not have won well known fact that not for the electoral collage obama would not have won all same with john kerry who are the locators who voted for him who are the electors all well that something for the state decide the state picks three people the speakers for those states they try find are supposed find non decided not any side representative for that state but that plan has failed the disaster factor the best known argument against the according the indefensible electoral collage bradford plumer richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole and etc all agree abolishing the after gore won the presidental election due the popular vote the people the thing best known the diaster factor came into play the disaster factor fiasco that happens the american goverment this happened because according the law state legislates are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people this happened then vice president also running for the big chair nixon the state corresponds for hawaii overthrew nixons oppens electors votes order for him win cheated win bribed the electors because lets real who gon na turn down dollars its the electors fault that bad leadership comes america the widely regarded anachronism according the article posted richard posner once again yet another reason abolish the being democrat myself the way the electoral collage set absolutely preposterous the third and final reason for the abolishment the simple the votes never count like ever and sick and tired stupid presidents winning like obama the hijo puta single president going everbody president even the greats such george washington john kennedy and abraham lincoln were not everybody presidents not everyone agreed their radical ideas but nobody agrees with obama nobody but because false votes made the electives obama won anyway but there several things would like conclude with look below anyway the should abolished because popovo rule and should not keep the electoral collage because its stoopid the end,2
the challenge exploring venus the author does not support the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers prevalent the planet the author uses poor diction supporting his idea and does not provide enough evidence for why but instead provides numerous examples how humans would study venus firstly the idea rising the challenge explore wondrous planet nice but the actual rationale behind unfortunately does not hold the same wondrous value the author points out paragraph astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system astronomers curiousity planet that could have possibly been similar earth not worth millions billions dollars which could used elsewhere simple fascination and speculation not incentive spend that type money humans should perfect spacecraft that will sent into space before shelling out millions dollars for very little information the answer seems clear the price simply outweighs the ultimate gain exploring venus contrary what would support the authors claim pursue further exploration venus includes various jackdaws exploring the planet the article states thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet hese conditions are far more leterme than enacting humans encounter earshot such environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and wuld liquefy many metals also notable venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer our sun beyond high pressure and heat venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land its surface all that mentioned the paragraph are reasons why humans should not pursue further exploration venus thick atmosphere carbon dioxide and other toxic gases clouds sulfuric acid average temperature over degrees atmospheric pressure strong enough crumple submarine like soda can erupting volcanoes and frequent lightning strikes essence the danger alone should dissuade anyone from even attempting visit venus the author goes after his brief reasoning explore venus give example how one would explore the planet states nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the rolling venusian landscape temperatures would still toasty around degrees farenheit not easy conditions but survivable for humans peering from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions because mos forms sligh can not penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms photography and videography ineffective more importantly researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance therefore scientists seeking conduct thorough mission understand venus would need get close and personal despite the risks presented once again that exploration venus would not only dangerous but will ultimately prove unfulfilling terms gathering information the author uses words such ineffective survivable not easy and limited all which refer the study the planet none his examples show some sort positive aspect exploring venus conclusion while the author idea that exploring venus will give new insight and better our overall ability understand space whole undeniable that exploration the planet simply not worth the risks dangers and costs presented evidence the article,6
dear senator recently there has been much debate about whether the electoral college should retained not after reading the articles very clear that the electoral college has worked efficiently for many years and therefore should kept way voting for our country president first all even though dispute over the outcome electoral college quite possible much less likely than dispute over the popular vote imagine argument broke out about the outcome popular voting there would absolute chaos and too many different opinions even though many voters would argue that they prefer direct voting the product that would only overcomplicated the system and make things run less smoothly secondly the electoral college should kept because restores the weight the political balance that the bigger states lose the virtues the mal apportionment the senate that was decreed the supreme law our country the constitution also makes tie highly unlikely lastly the system the electoral college helps avoid the problem run off elections there lot pressure for elections which candidate gets majority the votes cast were not for the electoral college that pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process the electoral college reduces the risk run off election and produces obvious winner according article three since almost all states award the electoral votes winner takes all basis even the smallest plurality single state can create landslide electoral vote victory that state each party selects slate electors trusted vote for tht party nominee and that trust hardly ever betrayed some people argue that the electoral college unfair because because possible that the winner the electoral vote may not win the national popular vote although that true and possible also incredibly rare happened once the election betweeen bush and gore but that was the first time since all all believe the electoral college has proven consistently successful the history our country after all has given great presidents and hopefully will continue the future elections come,3

the use the facial action coding system classroom feel would very valuable feel that would very beneficial for students and teachers the artifical explains that one facial movement can mean you feeling many different emotions this could helpful classrooms somebody feeling confused the teacher could recognize that and tweak the lesson help the individual could even help show the majority class having trouble with something the lesson subject hand can further explained another way facial coding classrooms could quite helpful for students with special needs for example theres student that confused frustrated with topic but does not know how put that into words the facial action coding system could help tremendously over time feel like this would beneficial tool have classrooms for children and teachers,2
the author supporting his idea starting off with interesting facts drawn the reader then goes into talking about why that planet named venus states that the plant known for having features like earth that means that could possibly live there when you have the reader questioning themselves they get drawn and what learn more thats what makes good artifical then talks the atmosphere venus says that the hard part about living there would just the high levels sulfuric acid that causes the degrees degrees fahrenheit the fact that venus has the hottest surface the hole solar system mercury closer the sun and yet venus gets hotter than that gose saying that scientists are discussing further visit honestly think thats crazy says that astrologers are fascinated venus because how similar earth long ago tried visit but since was far was hard building space ship that will that far nasa working spacecraft that will allow people venus will similar jet since they fly fast thats the plan and know that wont easy the hardest part about will preparing says can our best but since only have limited insight the ground most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere either way that won stop them from exploring more gose talk more about what nasa working and gives you history lesson while hes talks about world war and about how the modern technology let there learning about venus expand more its was powerful flexible and quick what ever they needed thats how they got learn about the atmosphere there around those times people started care about how they got there information and where the last paragraph his conclusion that venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity humans tend always have questions about everything exploring something have been doing since have been born the authors did very good job letting understand more about how our curiosity can lead grater things,3
thinking about future with self driving cars make think about shows and movies would watch growing the fact that driverless car might available the years soon come get really excited for long can remember there has been films out about the future and they always seem have some sort driverless car things similar that since the late people where already starting come with concepts about self driving cars position the whole driverless cars the future that pro self driving cars and here are few reasons why the cars they plan making the future would use half the fuel today cars use using less fuel will put the right path working reduce the use fossil fuels and help cut down pollution whole another reason why pro driverless car because self driving cars have been tested drive more than half million miles without crashing when compared humans driving cars they have also added many saftey feature these type cars like sensors that can help prevent skids and rollovers overall driverless cars while have many many saftey feature create safer roads now like anything else there cons the pro have just mentioned one them being that they will just cost much money wwa more than regular cars like wise some states there are laws put place that will not even allow for such cars like self driving cars even tested another thing that was brought what the driver gets berd having wait for their turn drive meaning that car prototypes have feature that will drive for you but you have have your hands the wheel and the car will switch over the drive incae the event ther road work accident and one the most important things that was mentioned the article what the driver where get accident while self driving car would the car manufactuers fault the person the driverless car cases like this will hard solve due the many factor involved all all there are some negatives aspects the self driving car reflect back everything having self driving driverless car would amazing accomplishment for the human race there are some cons and some pros the whole situation but for pro driverless cars think about all the inventions that could come from the driverless car this will open new doors opportunity for the next generations well this one this could all impact the quality life drastically everything will have impact the future should continue work prototypes make the roads better and safer place,3
the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers has now some may think the author crazy some may thinks the author correct well going find out for sure there claim that supports idea the evidence that numerous factores contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite its proximity meaning that venus can have humans beings now that worthy pursue but can also very dangerous due the scourging hot temperatures there know this because the article states that the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit which means that this risk but its worth finding life are making new earth then worth conclusion believe that author not crazy but has crazy drive find new living planet also that exploring venus worthy pursuit helpful nasa and know have knowledge there another planet can live the author feel correct,2
the author studies venus the way some people study science and how others study math and english the autor studies really hard what wants and needs know some dangers that percents would that not all venus safe and not all space safe either venus worthy planet because does not have all man kind destroying using venus place where some people see outside our world see what space really does look like paragraph talks about about venues sometimes called the evening star and one the most brightest points light the night sky also known earth twin because venus closest planet earth terms density and size says paragraph each pervious mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus conclusion states paragraph striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into mcnay equally intimidating endeavors throes words that came from paragraph would probably some what some danger but nit that much,2

the author has good point venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents venus being the most earth like planet our solar system believe that was covered with large oceans and supported forms life however various spacecrafts only survived several hours when landing venus first off venus still has earth like features the planet has rocky surface and includes valleys mountains and craters however the temperature venus surface averages over degrees fahrenheit and said that the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience here earth why believed that life once existed this planet extremely dangerous send anyone venus because they most likely wouldn make back home let alone survive couple hours the author stated that nasa working other ways study venus without risking the lives others which believe good idea spark more people interest knowing the plants around despite the dangers venus has eventually nasa will find way successfully send spacecraft group people there without doing any harm even though life today can not exist venus because the temperature and air quality worth looking into,3
the facial action coding system invasion privacy and should not used classrooms students students should chose when and who they reveal their emotions and this system deprives them that freedom stated nick alto most human communication not verbal meaning that people express their emotions their looks their actions but they chose when this the facial action coding system takes away this freedom from students they not have the choice when express what they are feeling anyone can just use face scanning system them imagine being able detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions alto this first sentence perfectly shows how takes away peoples freedom when they want express cherian emotions tertian people every human has natural rights and america everyone has the right freedom speech but part that right speech having the choice not speak the facial action coding system would take away people freedom facial expression emotion people should have the right chose who and when they express their emotions and this system takes away these rights,3
the author tells the article venus very dangerous due thick atmosphere about ninety seven percent carbon dioxide that covers venus not only the atmosphere high but the temperature and atmosphere pressure well the temperatures average over eight hundred degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure ninety times more than what humans experience earth although the conditions are extreme the author gives reasons visit and research more about venus stated astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system the author states that they are very amazed how venus could have been the most similar earth the author continues describing venus with similar earth features the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valley mountains ans craters next the author states that nasa already working making spacecraft last long venus said for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions nasa already planning visit venus for research overall the author supported his idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers giving reasons and telling how venus could very similar earth like planet,2

transportation vehicle like car very common these days efficient way travel for the most part and has been used option for traveling since the early although cars have many upsides they also have downsides too limiting car usage more places there could many advantages first could improve safety also will conserve resources and lastly limiting car usage will allow tremendous decrease pollution limiting car usage will improve safety number ways limiting car usage there will most likely decrease deaths since many car accidents result fatality not only cars colliding with other cars that the issue cars having the power destroy most things comes contact with cars are not toys but rather death machines they have the ability cause major damage which why limited usage enforced there will most likely less accidents resulting major minor injuries even death there are many options for getting around besides using car for example there are electric scooters mopeds skateboards rollerskates bicycles and even good old fashioned walking while some these could potentially dangerous they are probably not dangerous driving car another reason limiting car usage could beneficial the conservation resources cars are heavy machinery and need abundance fuel keep them going for years and years what powers most vehicles currently fossil fuel fossil fuel not everlasting resource and will gone someday now there are some cars that run electricity but for the most part cars around the world run fossil fuel considering that there are about one two cars per household nowadays that would mean both cars are probably getting filled with gas even being charged with electricity which could run your electricity bill through the roof since this applies most people around the world think the resources being used daily this usage resources could lessened just limiting the usage cars the last benefit limiting car usage less air pollution cars run fossil fuel stated the previous paragraph when car being driven that fuel exits the car gas state this gas form fuel very harmful the environment with many cars the road today the atmosphere already polluted great deal usually you will see signs that read idling outside store any public area where cars are allowed which means that when you are parked and are going parked for extended period time you should turn your car off that does not let out gas paris partial driving ban was actually enforced that the amount smog the air would decrease that how much the usage cars can affect environment overall setting limitation car usage more places can have benefits could improve safety conserve resources and allow for less pollution the environment with these reasons don see many reasons for people frown upon this idea,4
the author explainers how sees challenge goal reach paragraph states striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors shows how believes that could reach this goal convinced that worthy challenge meet according paragraph spacecraft survived the landing for over couple hours each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the author issues the problem that three decades not one spacecraft has landed venus numeros issues also venus reputation possible mission for human study according the text numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for human study despite its proximity this proves the point why three decades not one spacecraft hasn landed because dangerous around there there high chance that your running into death for study that nobody really sure about stating that there could chance that could somewhat like earth astronomers are trying get venus because they bilevel that venus was once like earth like the factors that earth have they bilevel that venus also have according paragraph astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system that shows how there into studying more into venus and going try complete the mission that nobody has done venus and study and see there life venus factors that relate earth with venus all the features haves according the facts the passage states the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters author states that venus could are options vist furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary vist crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel the author describes how the national aeronautics and space administration has idea creation make the vist venus happened nasa solution idea send humans study venus they manage that goal with there plan that they think that could work such decribed paragraph says nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape explains how they plan send humans venus and study venus that there plan reach that challenge that hasn been done many researchers have the idea work there machines last longer enough put venus and really study from close enough many researchers are working innovation that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus this statement shows that the plan they have travel human and going around isnt enough not good enough get the good studies the planet see the true facts nasa has been working electronics that could used the planet perhaps from projects and experiments putting them into test environment like was venus nasa working other approaches studying venus for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions this shows how they think there could life venus and perhaps step that planet like was earth this shows how nasa science really want meet this challenge and making goal accomplish there convinced that venus somewhat like earth perhaps one has been there for the risk for human there there working make happened with reasearch science new ideas that they put test our travels earth and beyond should not limited danger and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation this what the author strongly describes with back information and details,4
ever since world war our development has been centered the car now people are questioning whether not have gone the correct direction with many people coming realization that private transportation may not the best option for travel hard deny there are already developed places the world experimenting with the absence cars their society vauban germany one those places vauban residents have undertaken the task turning their streets completely car free and working the residents the district even claim enjoy community without automobiles more people claim less tense and happier without owning car percent vauban families not own cars those who live areas dedicated large garages the edge the development that car owners but for along with home while efforts the past making cities denser have given people better reason walk hasn gone away all people are still driving everywhere they the united states car reduced communities are being promoted the environmental protection agency and legislators are starting act this public transport serving suburbs will play much larger role new federal transportation bill being approved this year vauban not the only place with that has experimenting with banning private transportation paris has banned driving due smog after days near record pollution clear the air the city the smog rivaled beijing china one the most polluted cities the world people blamed diesel fuel because french tax policy favors diesel over gasoline diesel makes percent vehicles france paris has more smog than other european capitals many companies complained lost revenue but exceptions were made allow plug cars hybrids and cars carrying three more passengers public transit was also free charge friday monday the smog cleared enough monday for the ban odd numbered plates lifted bogota columbia also doing their part attempting reduce the amount automobiles used society car free day has been effect for three years bogota with large turnout the streets were free traffic jams millions columbians hiked biked skated and took buses work people comment how great opportunity reice stress and air pollution columbia municipal authorities from other countries travel bogota see the event and they believe revolutionary change since the day without cats was implemented into improvement camapign that began the mid miles bicycle path has been constructed columbia the united states are being affected these other countries choices give air pollution for less stressful and tense life recent studies suggest decrease the amount cars being bought americans well the amount people getting licences not buying cars are helping americans with their finances and improving their health sociologists believe that this pattern persists will benefit the american public and environment greatly,3
the facial action coding system unnecessary piece equipment the software that would able detect the emotions individual would have several negative affects society the reading emotions useful tool when detected someone natural instinct but would not helpful only have understanding someone emotions due the results given screen the facial action coding system not valuable students because would decrease the rate which students learn identifying someone emotions will not change how they are feeling and would decrease their motivation for work the future the ability for this device detect the emotions student while they are working would detrimental the health and responsibilty the student the author states that the machines will recognize when the student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective instructor alto this would harmful the students determination learn would also cause several students fall behind their education every student experiences boredom class but the teacher unable change the lesson everytime best fit one individual student because the other children will fall behind students are still capable learning material when they are bored even not effectively when they are interested students need also learn how work through their emotions better their ability improve when these students get into the work field they can not call sick slack off every time they experience negative emotion this device would teaching children that they should only productive they are intrigued their task this would not proper lesson teach growing individuals the technology able identify human true emotions but that will not alter the way that person feels humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them feel better stated the article they even indicate the difference between genuine smile and forced one alto this line states that the lab partner will able tell difference inbetween genuine and meaningful smile from harshly forced smile there difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although happy gesture the machine informing someone that they need smile will not actually change the emotions that person politicians and celebrities are major culprits this action they often smile they are told but they are not always genuine they are typically hiding something from their spectators such when they are not being truthful alto just because famous people smile when talking looking their audience does not change whether not they are happy individuals humans themselves are unable change their emotions when they can detect that something wrong then machines will unable that also although can give people precise measurement their emotions will not change how they feel therefore investing this system would extremely useless and wasteful the technology that recognizes emotions order change the student potential will decrease their motivation the skill compatible working through tough situations essential possess modifying students workload would harm their motivation these students will longer motivation their most effective because they will expect everything life modified their liking unfortunately this not trait that can successfully transferred real world issues therefore these students will less prepared for potential problems they may encounter this system would also decrease the dependence human connection the text states that computers need understand emotional communications because most human connection nonverbal alto although that statement true there little use for computers understanding how humans feel they can not help the individual with their emotions this may cause people reply more the machines which would lessen the amount human connection that exists much like previous technology advances have done human connection essential striving population therefore will have negative affect society the facial action coding sytem would wasteful the society and would cause several negative effects not something worth investing because would harm the developing youth not only these machines prove useless emotions people but will also decrease the motivation students and future employees,6
have you ever thought about what life would like the planet venus over the years scientists and astronomers have been studying venus able sustain life even with the temperatures eight hundred degrees farenheit and with atmospheric pressure that ninety times greater than what experience earth see why the author thinks that pursuing this journey will worth one reason why think the author for pursuing the journey venus because the analogous features that earth and venus share paragraph four the text the author states that the surface contains rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters this crucial the author point because shows how many ways earth and venus are much alike just the author questions our sister planet inhospitable why are scientists even discussion furthur visits its surface one nasa possible solutions another reason why feel the author thinks worth the trip venus this solution described sending spaceship outer space hover about thirty more miles above the surface according the article temperature would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level the article also implies that there would plenty energy through solar power and would survivable but with rough conditions even with the advanced technology that have today scientists are beginning look back and discover that mechanical computers that were used back the and might just the technology that need study venus according the text systems that use mechanical parts can made more resistant pressure heat and other forces the advanced technology that have today not meant used conditions such venus has with this being said these mechanical computers could very important studying our pursuit venus the future conclusion the exploration venus could very dangerous very beneficial the future space exploration though with the similarities between earth and venus the possible approach hovering the planet and using technology that will sustain such conditions all are reasons why this journey could worth the danger one will ever find the answers their questions they choose not explore them,4
have you ever been through major change you probably have and has luke bomberger went from being rootin tootin cowboy seagoing cowboy many people like change some people hate fact feel that change good for helps come miles out our comfort zone were you would take many chances could for one bomberger had blast traveling many different places says paragraph toured excavated castle crete and marveled the panama canal his way china crazy amazing right was admiring one place his way another what lucky guy another thing bomberger got places that many people may never for example had been china eastern coast the and europe way farther out north america then ill ever was probably millions miles away from where his comfort zone his house also just the over all experience you get when you try something new bomberger states paragraph that being seagoing cowboy was much more fun adventure its all about the people you share the moment with also they could make adventurous scary fun sad but you see getting pushed building your comfort zone can fun scary course uncomfortable next time you want say some thing take chances and say yes,3

not think that driverless cars are good idea think that unsafe too expensive for most people afford and there would lot legal issues well first driverless cars would unsafe because lot things could wrong the car could glitch when you are not watching the road and not notify you when pay attention and that could result accident says the passage driverless cars are coming that the car can steer accelerate and brake themselves but not designed not able navigate through situations that need human skills this means that the human driver must remain alert and the car must able quickly get the drivers attention when problem occurs but the car could not get the drivers attention quick enough then that could problem second driverless cars would very expensive and most people would never able afford them although does not state how much the car would actually cost the car does have these thing called automotive radar sensors according sebastian thrun founder google car project radar was device hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars with all these fancy features that these smart cars have could really make that price way finally the driverless car companies would face lot legal action lawmakers know that driving safety best achieved with alert drivers result most states illegal even test computer driven cars which means that would take lot convincing the car companies make these cars legal even the traffic laws changes new laws would still needed order cover liability case accident conclusion think that these cars bad idea too many things could wrong and people could get hurt there nothing wrong with how drive cars nowadays why change thought process,4
there are many advantages limiting car usage the whole world has already figured that out many countries are now starting limit the car usage good idea limit the car usage because they damage our enviroment and cars are not needed for average everyday life first reducing the use cars would make the world much better place terms the enviroment the article paris bans driving due smog written robert duffer explains how the smog caused cars has polluted the air causing paris put partial ban driving diesel fuel was blamed since france has tax policy that factors diesel over gasoline diesels make percent vehicles france this quote robert duffer explains just how bad the air must have been polluted because the cars they blamed the pollution diesel fuel and that was percent the cars france which lot and was bad that they had make partial ban driving can already tell that our enviroment not that good because all the other pollutants that have but reducing the usage cars that can make our enviroment much better because that getting rid one major factor the problem pollution next many people not even use cars that much stated the article the end car culture written elisabeth rosenthal study last year found that driving young people decreased percent between and this quote states that lot new people are not starting drive anymore without new people driving will just loose the amount people driving continuously becasue people dying and people replace them also the article german suburb life goes without cars written also elisabeth rosenthal explains how the people don need cars anymore because they can just walk ride find another way their destination therefore there longer need for cars then can easily limit the use them conclusion there not reason anymore use cars can compact some cities and make everything easy enough access without car then could just get rid them completely cars are only used for transportation otherwise they just cause problems like pollution accidents and being unhealthy would excellent limit car usage help the enviroment and jst get rid them entirely becasue longer need them,4
driverless cars are coming here near the future will having more driverless cars the streets would good idea have them for many reasons driverless car not truly driverless they still alert the driver take over when your complicated traffic misses would keep away from lot wrecks benefit the older people and much more bmw annouced development trafic jam they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requiems human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents other words the driver would have aware taking over the sterling weel when the situation requiems result most states illegal even test computer driven cars california nevada florida and the district columbia have led the coutry allowing limited use semi autonomous cars even trafic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident the technology fails and someone injured who would the blame against the driver the manufacturer this would great change for the world and would save more life they would also have make fun some manufacturers hope that bringing car entertainment systems tat use heads displays such displays can turned off instantly when the driver needs take over something not available drivers trying text ith ell phone this way the car system actually safety feature and safety big conocer,2
when you turn sixteen you filled with anticipation and ansty getting your licence and furthermore car know have certainly been there but what good about getting car well other than the new found sense freedom not much car usage has accelerated since the and starting gradually decline why less stress less pollution and more excercise these things alone may not enough convince you let jump into the facts first off getting rid that car your driveway will greatly lower your stress result percent vauban families not own cars and percent sold car move here when had car was always tense much happier this way when you think about truly makes sense when you have car you have worry about gas prices payments and fixes but when you live car free life none that your concern therefore your stress decreases and your happiness can all time high when you have one less bill each month truly does leave impact secondly have big issue that our hands pollution and smog who fault ours fumes and smoke crowding into our atmosphere with where else our cars are huge part diesel fuel was blamed france for their smog layers cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer air trap car emissions need put stop this destroying our planet will continue destroy until make change and something make this stop our hands and can just let the problem will not just away will not just fix itself when you are living this day age many people have cars they have need out and walk skate bike anywhere because they have more efficient way transportation colombians hiked biked skated took buses work during car free day yesterday this means that people would getting and active get work and other places that they may need helping our environment and themselves furthermore cars are slowly but surely being forgotten people are stopping their use cars and taking alternative transportation but america love affair with its vehicles seems cooling not big deal used not everyone needs wants have car anymore the pattern persists and many sociologists believe will will have beneficial implications for the carbon emmissions and the environment since transportation the second largest source america emissions just behind power plants when you decide that you don want car you benefiting from and the future benefiting from taking the next step seems bit out reach but can make conclusion people see cars something that must have next step their freedom but can change that show the world that more harmful than helpful one small step for man leap for mankind can get there but takes more than one person set down the keys reduce your stress reduce the pollution and increase your happiness all takes one person start movement,4
completely against the idea the development driverless cars laws technical difficulties and liability issues are all factors that make doubt the good driverless cars driverless cars could potentially one the largest safety problems the road say this because there are already laws some states that prevent testing these cars the article says most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety best achieved with alert drivers this means that law made usually advocate safety the prevention testing the cars some states make doubt the safety these cars don think that driverless cars would safe the roads with many variables the environment car malfunctions fails alert the driver oncoming car could potentially fatal both vehicles technical difficulties the car failing recognize danger could easily more unsafe than impaired student driver quote from the article would some manufacturers hope that meaning making driving more fun bringing car entertainment and information systems that use heads displays such displays can turned off instantly when the driver needs take over the car fails alert the driver death could large option consider the car might not react time avoid collision pedestrian nothing this world would rather take chances what could considered dangerous drivers than rely car with emotions there are also liabilities between drivers and the makers the cars that could even larger problem resulting from technical difficulties human error would difficult distinguish between what would the car fault versus what would the driver fault the article discusses while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver possible solve for the liability problems this could major problem due breaches privacy the car were watch the person the data must somewhere and some data should kept private lawsuit could easily erupt from situation such that and will problem for both parties conclusion believe driverless cars are not only safety hazard but privacy problem well the safety technical difficulties laws and liabilities should concern for everyone before driverless cars are completely road legal,4

despite the conditions venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit supports his idea showing the reader how important venus surface also talks about why scientists are still curious about venus and why venus history can important geographically long ago venus was very earth like venus had surface rocky sediment and included familiar features like valleys and mountains the planet was also largely covered with oceans hopes venus returning like its older self scientists are looking into way explore the planet but with its challenging conditions scientists are looking into more options rather than sending humans which could disasterous and wouldnt very safe those unimaginable conditions the author goes depth way scientists are trying find alternative sending humans with ther conditions venus its dificult for scientists find solution although these obstacle the author pushes the idea continue the research venus conclusion the author uses good sources back his idea why scientists should continue their work with venus,2
hello astronomer nasa here discuss that the face discovered mars fake reason that the face discovered mars fake because the area where the face was discovered cydonia has strom their lot and snow there possibility that was huge landform and the weather wore off the the landform the point where was face about month ago have released the picture jpl web site revealing that the face just another landform right now are trying look the face look and conclude another landform and not aliens have also found that the landmass the bottleneck volcano maybe few years will erupt and prove that not face yes have made history taking one little picture that can even look you wan na look the face just look these coordinates degrees north martian latitude maybe you will see landform and not face this the astronomer nasa and this proving that this landform not face thank you for your time reading this and goodbye the way mesa,3

everybody knows the future coming and already happened some driverless cars however not all good idea for the future what ever you can never one hundred percent trust technology matter what the case driverless cars are not fully finished are not truly driverless and are very unsafe driverless cars are not even finished stated the text these smart road systems worked suprisingly well but they required massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply too expensive practical they are very expensive have all this technology put into the cars most all they can actually steer accelerate and brake themselves but only that also states that mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have cars that can drive themselves the year which actually means that are years away from the real thing that unless they release earlier later add the driverless cars are not all truly driverless the car requires humans human skills case the car having difficulty quoted the paragraph they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills the cars were truly driverless then why does require humans work although have agree that humans need all the work any type car matter what the condition driverless cars are very unsafe you can never completely trust technology matter how long you have had been your life many humans the world text and drive now imagine how bad will once driverless cars appear the future the driver texting and the car needs human skills navigate through unknown unfamiliar terrain the driver will have clue because her face will stuck phone some other type handheld device driverless cars are not the brightest idea because they are unsafe not truly driverless and are incomplete everyone needs focus driving and the road and not their cell phones while the road don that person that everyone cautious about because you are unsafe and not cautious safe and don get driverless car get normal car,4
many countries the world starting develop high techonology the use computers very necessary scientists begin working study new techonology help humans lives become more convenience one the new uses techonology that reading and identifying human emotions while highschool students usually have trouble know their friends and classmates opinions about them the new technology called the facial action coding system classroom valuable the use computers read humans emotions expressions helpful because can read emotional expression accurately and people will need especially students highschool students often curious about what people think about them but sometimes they could not know what the emotion exactly means therefore they need techonology that can help them specifically the facial action coding system this techonology allows computers analyze both simple and complex facial expressions order this the computer has built movements facial muscles and all those movements are the same movements the face real life one more way can tell this technology can work well that compares every emotion emotion face because says each expression compared against neutral face showing emotion the text with its characteristics the facial action coding system can help students classes students then can understand their classmates partners easier they would feel more confidence and could focus lessons better the purpose studying techonology help humans lives become better all technologies are really useful and have certain value humans including the use facial action coding system this technology that can help identify correctly people feeling base what they are showing their faces when highschool students often face challenges understand other students facial expressions the use this techonology needed not only because can work well but also help classes more effectively improving students feeling this technology very valuable and every students will need one,3
some people complain that not having car they aren allowed complete certain tasks limits their chances for actually doing better life only those people knew how bad having car could sometimes myself person without car and already stressed out when having car you have deal with the constant prices gas the troubles your car breaks down not and being reliable taxi they like call for those people who are car free believe there should some car limitations enforced you just read that last sentences that paragraph and probably thought man this girl crazy but serious there are actually great amount advantages for limitations car usage for example the constant worrying about gas how much going cost can afford this week will make work with only half tank stated here when had car was always tense much happier this way said heidrun walter from german suburb lies goes without cars think about this way giant weight has just been lifted off your shoulders being without car isn bad may seem there more having deposit your life savings when your car breaks down better yet having constantly think about that nasty smog that comes out the back muffler when you need tune,2
are very close venus and mars and some points are closer venus than mars and vise versa astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system the national aeronautics and space administration has idea that they want send humans venus study this planet but there lot dangers involved they that the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers giving all the reason why humans should bad things that could happen humans landed venus and things they can make this idea work nasa already beleive that there could life mars and that people could living mars couple decades even less why wouldn they want find that out about another planet has already been suggested that there once was life venus paragraph states today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth nasa thinks that being the land would able study better because they don think peering venus from ship orbiting doing enough also giving them challenges that they can work the equipment make last longer article the challenge exploring venus does state the bad outcomes landed venus and what could wrong paragraph talks about the conditions venus for example the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet also states that the condition venus are more extreme than anything humans have encountered earth venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet solar system these things are very dangerous but despite the dangers this article still able support the idea that venus worthy pursuit paragraph they focus things they would have avoid the dangerous conditions for example one thing allowing scientist float above the fray floating over the fray venus would just like our jet airplanes the conditions venus are not easy but they would survivable for humans the only way study venus well being the planet because looking venus far away can only provide limited insight ground conditions scientist want able take samples from the ground and from the rocks venus the dangers going venus should not stop worth face some the dangers make history and discover new things especially another planet the dangers venus will only push scientist harder find way make venus will also push them design new technology that could stand being venus conditions there many evidence prove that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers,4
the challenge exploring venus the author attempts convince the reader that studying venus worth all the dangerous problems one would face trying study the beautiful planet the author starts off his argument stating how challenging examine venus close proximity and provides state all the factors studying venus and explain why dangerous explore this planet the author first states facts about venus that would affect mission the surface these comments are mostly about atmosphere stating that the thick atmosphere almost carbon dioxide and contains high amounts sulfuric acid which result causes the temperature average over degrees fahrenheit and top that off the atmospheric pressure times greater then planet earth suggesting that submarine that was made endure earth deepest parts the ocean would crushed planet venus later the author explains why should even try learn more about this supposedly miss understood planet the author claims that astronomers are fascinated venus because they believe that could have been the planet most like earth the solar system one point the past possessing large oceans and being able support various forms life and that even now venus still has traits that could hint the idea that used lot like earth such having rocky sediment surface along with valleys mountains and craters although the author could have gone more into depth this subject inferring that astronomers should study venus surface because humanity wants know why this change may have happened and could avoid earth following the same path his argument why should study venus surface highly valid and valued strong reason despite the dangers overall the author the passage the challenge exploring venus has strong thought out reason why humanity should explore venus close the years come,4
who knew that planet referred earth twin could possibly provide many unknowns humans venus the second planet our solar system and the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too venus has more harsh environment than earth with surface temperature over degrees and thick atmosphere nearly percent carbon venus not tolerable for humans despite these presented dangers the author the article suggests that studying venus worth the risks the author the article mentions clearly paragraph three the intolerable living conditions the planet venus although the author has knowledge these dangers they claim that studying the earth like planet worth order back their claim the author provides facts the texts convince the reader the following long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth this excerpt for example may cause the reader make inferences about other similarities between earth and venus and would spark more interest learning about venus addition similar physical features the author mentions how venus our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel this very vital fact and significantly backs the authors claim many planets and stars are several hundred light years away making space travel and new discoveries humans difficult the closeness venus would allow humans visit venus there was safe way get there leading off the previous statement the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has been formulating solution the hostile conditions the surface venus imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape this would allow scientist get extremely close the surface venus yet not close enough gather samples from the planet itself the author the article the challenge exploring venus suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the author was able effectively support the idea that studying venus worth the risk the nearest planet visit well the idea blimp like vehicle allowing close access the planet make new scientific discoveries despite the dangerous temperatures and atmosphere composed nearly percent carbon dioxide the author provided many examples why studying venus worth the risk make new discoveries and gather beneficial information about earth called twin,4

think theatr should have good evidence study venus firs that venus the hottest than the solar system venus stopped some the natural damages and venus would allow scientist float above the fray first reason that the venus more hot than our solar system the paragraph say venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer our son this mean that mercury closer our sun than venus but however venus has the high temperature hottest second that venus weather impediment some the bad the natural destroys the paragraph says venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruption volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes this mean that venus have good weather stp those natural destroys that probably could cause big damage our planet and kill many poeple last reason that would allow scientist float above the fray the paragraph says travel higher altitude fly over many storms not easy condition survivable for humans this mean that wanat travel venus you can fly and also you can survive all the dangers that are venus planet conclusion venus the hottest planet than our solar sytem venus stopped some the natural damages for human and venus would allow scientist float above the fray this reasons are why the venus planet worthy,3
the author supports the idea well that venus worthy planet study the way that people can study venus stay above the surface blimp they could build space crafts and rovers out the strongest material earth and they could also make submarine like vehicle that strong enough with stand the heat and the presure the fact that venus planet that close should make easy not easy because the presure and the heat way get around these issues make blimp that will stay above the surface the world then only gets part the presure and heat then they can try get evidence and samples from the surface the planet bring back with them study earth they could get the strongest material earth and use make space crafts and rovers that will with stand the full heat and presure then the rover could collect samples gases and rocks could also get photographs and videos what the surface looks like could then take everything back earth and then humans could study the different samples collected they could make submarine like vehicle that can withstand the presure they that then they can collect the samples and figure out venus had life before they could find out venus could become new home for humans needed then the submarine could send all the evidence back and then can study all the evidence need study learn more about venus conclusion they need make vehicle out the strongest material send down the surface venus and try collect samples then the vehicle will come back earth with the different materials and then humans would get work studying the samples,3
venus interesting planet our solar system this scorching planet can reach extremly high temperatures and conditions this planet are dangerous that being said its hard believe refered earth twin well believe not earth and venus share more similarities than you may think the artifical the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that despite venus conditions should trying explore this planet and more educated the author this artifical did make few valid arguments why should more willing take risks find out more information about this firey hot planet first lets start with run down venus characteristics that mimic earths venus the closest planet earth terms size and density some circumstances venus acutely closest distance too depending their differences speed astronomers are fascinated venus because they think may have been more earth like plante long ago they think venus was probably covered with oceans the planet surface itself has rocky sediment and includes similar features like valleys mountains and craters why havent gone the planet before and the risks for starters venus has thick atmosphere percent carbon dioxide blankets has clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid the temperatures can reach all the way degrees farenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than experience earth venus also has been known have erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes and spacecraft has survived the landing venus for mor than few hours conclusion reading the artifical think should furthering our research venus venus could have supported various life forms before and want know how venus got the way now how could that nasa has idea that could possibly float above venus avoid the hostile conditions but even then would still degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would closer sea levels and the ration wouldnt exceed the earths levels even then there would still limited reasearch the ground conditions because most forms light cant get through the thick atmosphere which means cant use standard forms photography and videography and wouldnt able take samples rock gas anything else nasa however working some simplified electronics made silicon carbine and have been tested chambers simulated venus surface and have lasted three weeks these conditions think could learn more about our twin planet and would nice have the reasearch done and actually educated venus,3
twenty five years ago something funny happened around mars nasa viking spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos possible landing sites for its sister ship viking when spotted the shadowy likeness human face enormous head nearly two miles from end end seemed staring back the cameras from regions red planet called cydonia the face mars all natural landform its huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadow giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth the face mars natural landform there was alien monument after all research shows the face mars natural landform there was alien monument said research what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho thats lava dome that takes the isolated mesa about the same height the face mars rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size there was more than the fact its just the face mars there were objects the picture like airplanes the ground pyramids even small shakes you would able see what they were,2
all around the world car use declining and are witnessing different approaches that reduce pollution and reliance cars vauban germany experimental suburb does not allow any cars and compact that transportation can foot bike paris number days banned the use cars for large part the population due the amount pollution and smog bogota columbia one day year reserved car free day which all cars are prohibited many other cities are joining this holiday obviously the over use cars todays society and the pollution causes large cities problem these societies are taking steps toward making the areas better places live the car free community experiment vauban germany was completed and home people many the residents the community including heidrun walter feel much happier this way opinion car free community which can walk any friends house store sounds exciting and enjoyable also the amount pollution would decrease would outstanding many communities are noticing this trend and are interested how catching paris france ban cars with certain license plates was enforced clear the air the city the ban was enforced after near record breaking pollution the smog created unhealthy atmosphere full congestion after nearly week the smog cleared enough that the ban was rescinded car free day taking hold colombia started bogota which one day year all car use prohibited the citizens are often excited participate and for the last three years the turnout has grown this participation helps the pollution the society and influences other communities the same all these societies are taking different approaches reducing car use but they are all working hopefully limiting car usage will continue grow throughout the world,3

venus the hottest planet our solar system the second planet from the sun the challenge exploring venus the author talks about the dangers exploring venus the author describes the temperature venus the danger its light and the overall danger besides explains what venus planet and not star looks like the author also states that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents venus often referred earth twin both planets are close size and density one difference that venus over times hotter temperature than earth the average temperature venus over degrees fahrenheit that hotter than earth will ever the challenge exploring venus the author states these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth such environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquefy many metals the author also states also notable venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer the sun that example from the story the author trying explain that venus hot that would melt anything less then minute besides being hot venus also very bright venus light brighter than our eyes could ever see bright venus that not even researches can take photo video the planet this must mean that research have keep their distance they get close they will have the risk becoming blind dying from the hot temperature the challenge exploring venus the author states most importantly researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance the author also states many researches are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus the uther trying explain that since researchers have keep their distance they can take sample with them earth samples from venus would help them gain knowledge venus venus has many dangers and risks exploring the planet researches can the planet because hot and the light very bright their machines keep melting from the hot temperature the author the challenge exploring venus explains the dangers but the author also states venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents,4
are driverless cars really necessary most know how drive already why have computer for personally don see need for these kind cars now they still need driver behind the wheel whats the difference main point for not wanting these cars around the fact that they most likely going very expensive there are cars that are labeled luxury that for hundreds thousands dollars and whose say that these cars won there with them all the technology and all the research that goes into these will come with pretty large price tag does have large price tag then will only reach the elite most luxury cars now most americans today don have enough money buy everyday car only the famous wealthy population will get own this car how will this car affect others this car affordable most the population and most people get one will still need drivers education class the answer will yes since these cars are not yet fully able drive themselves you will still have take some kind course learn how drive these cars now the course will change drastically there might even different course made people could take course how manually drive and course learn how drive autonomous car there will most likely new rules how stay safe behind the wheel car that can almost drive its own when and these cars become mass manufactured might for some law changes new laws handling these cars new laws about where and when you can drive and even age limitations think with these cars the government going make get special licence operate these cars would think this licence would available people and over who have had years driving experience and have taken course learn all they can about controlling these cars this way they encounter rough patch where they had take control they would prepared and know how take control lastly are these cars any way better than manually driving car cell phone laws won change what the need have your car drive for you you would still have keep your eyes the road prepared for taking control when needed they are almost synonymous with cruise control you don have keep your foot the gas but when stop light turn some other action arises that you can stay the same speed for you have cancel the cruise control and put your foot back the gas what you just happen not ready take control has created seat the vibrates when drivers need take control think something more alerting would needed people would know emergency and they need pay attention conclusion think these cars are waste time should just stick driving ourselves know whose blame and don have file lengthy lawsuits see the company responsible not would just another unecessary hazard the road that one ready for,4
the idea having new and evolved vehicles might scare some people having driverless cars has positive and negative sides driverless cars are cars that drive themselves and dont need human being behind the wheel the idea for having invented driverless cars that different types peple can multi task while they are the car many people get detracted and need become wear what happening their surroundings while different people think that driverless cars are bad thing there are some positives the idea some the positives are that you wouldnt have worry about texting and driving drinking and driving you would get home safe and you wouldnt even have touch the tearing wheel another positive that has sensors that your about backup into and object gives you signal inform you that you need watch out and the same with when your driving and you get really close getting accident one last positive thing that you you are tired are condition which you can not drive back certain place driverless car can take you there there are negatives having driverless cars aswell not all driverless cars can and will the exact same thing some the negatives having driverless cars that not all the cars will the same another reason that they might not capable its job another reason that many people may not like the idea driverless cars because they are used the idea regular cars and they like control where they are going and how they are driving one last reason why driverless cars are negative thing because the might too expensive that not many people are willing spend much money there are also positives and negatives about regular cars some people might used driving regular cars and dont want change that but because all the technology that has been changing over the years one point driverless cars not become something that everyone has some people might think that are behind our technological advances personalty think that both types cars are great you want driverless car then why shouldn you allowed have one but you dont want driverless car and you like regular cars because the fact that you can control where you are going and how you are driving then that should fine too just need make sure that everyone the rode wether you have driverless car regular one are safe,3
there are many advantages driving car but there are even more reasons limiting usage cars there are driving one most people today drive thier cars get from one location another but most not think about what actually does the environment most cars run form diesel fuel which release carbon emissions and other greenhouse gasses which are harmful towards the environment passenger cars europe are responsible for around the greenhouse gasses there and most car intensive areas the united states greenhouse gas emissions released for day france car usage was banned reduce the amount smog the area after days intensifying smog the amount car traffic was reduced another great reason for reducing the usage cars that causes less stress towards people and yourself and greatly reduces traffic for other cars bogota once year they have day without cars which part improvement campaign that began the mid since then has seen the construction miles bike paths sports centers and multiple parks some people prefer biking than driving which saso good way get fit since there are many bikers there most the uneven sidewalks have been replaced larger and smoother sidewalks the end there are many reasons limit the usage cars but people should consider more for what does for the world,3
life goes without cars german suburb well least thats what sounds like while the residents vauban germany community have given their cars paris also believes banning cars for while would good due the smog shocked because cars are big help you asked why they think cars are not useful anymore the residents vauban germany feel that cars are not really useful them result percent vauban families not own cars and percent sold car move here most the residents say they are much happier without their vehicles and would perfumer that way believe they have adapted not depending cars and they dont mind walking many feel they were tense while having their cars like was burden vauban completed example growing trend europe the united states and elsewhere seperate suburban life from auto use vauban has been successful without cars auto use and their encouraging others the concept their using not bad but feel auto use makes things quicker and easier vauban germany are not the only ones not using cars paris has banned driving due the smog opinion paris has great reason for banning driving and yes because the smog the other hand paris believes the cause the smog because the cars pollution the cars are causing pollution because the gasoline used diesel was blamed diesels make percent vehicles france compared percent average diesel engines the rest western europe according reuters this valuable point that cars are not useful paris well they can find gasoline for their cars that will not cause pollution smog auto use shouldn bad paris all have different feelings about cars and auto use the united states cars are big part transportation for study last year found that driving young people decreased percent between and other countries around the world walking and other ways transportation works for them such vauban germany they enjoy walking and dont need cars and paris cars were banned for causing smog and they are getting around just fine without auto use,3
venus planet that similiar certain ways earth earth and venus both orbit the sun and venus can spotted from earth this story the author supports the idea venus exploration with great ideas and facts support his claims the author says how visiting venus could both good and bad for humans and gives great reasoning both point views the author never gives their opinion the subject but instead gives the reader reasons for both sides the arguement paragraph the author says how venus has very dangerous atmosphere and supports that saying that the clouds the atmosphere are full highly corrosive sulfuric acid says how the planets average temperature over degrees fahrenheit the author uses those facts support the claim that those conditions are far more extreme than any human can withstand paragraph then goes say that long ago venus could have possibly been the closest thing earth being covered with oceans valleys and craters possibly being able support various life forms explains nasa idea bimp like vehicle hovering miles above the planets atmosphere for closer exploration although the temperatures would still very harsh the author ends off the writing daying that humans must meet the challenges venus order conquer space exploration human curiosity could possibly come back araud and hurt the end but must know whats out there case our planet longer inhabitable closes the story saying that our travels earth and beyond should not limited but should exceed them order great,3
not think that there should driverless cars driverless cars still need driver them they also can drive around know road getting fixed the cars could also dangerous these are reason why think should have driverless cars first reason why should have driverless cars because they cars still need have driver them the car should not concerted driverless they still need driver take over just case accident ahead the cars also not have eyes can not see how will work night also during the winter the driverless cars would have lot accidents because snow and ice second reason the cars would not know when there dead end the roads are getting fixed these cars could run off the road bridge was not complete the computer hardware could down the middle driving and people could died these cars are not humans and could kill lots people because simple mistakes final reason these cars can dangerous because how would they know when children are running through the streets these cars would not safe around children elderly people the article its says the technology fails and someone was injured who fault the driver the manufactuers how will the law handle situtation like these who would fault they would not know not think they should driverless cars for many reasons there are also some good reason why could have them couple reason are they dont use much gas they thing that humans can not but these cars can dangerous the community think that there should not driverless cars and cars should say how they are,4
cars are important some people why should taking taken away from you especially you bought with your hard working money some countries are starting take cars away from some people due their laws suburb german david goldberg official transportation for american trying promote new communities that less dependent cars paris they banned driving due smog let not forget about colombia who has banned cars days after days and has force people use buses and taxis most mayors whoever incharge transportion feel like the country needs little adjustments german suburb life goes without cars street parking driveways and home garages are generally forbidden this experimental new district vauban streets are completely car free but some car ownership allowed but there are only two places park large garages car owner can buy space for their home some people enjoy they moment with having cars them feels like less stress and also saving money vauban home residents may the most advanced experiment lowcarb suburban life for the past two decades they have been trying make the city more denser and better for walking though causing less stress some people the other half are missing their cars paris bans driving due mong after days near record pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city some days even numbered license plates were ordered leave their cars home suffer euro fine and the next the day the odd numbered plates the same almost drivers were fined according international news headquartered london diesel fuel was blamed since france has tax policy that favor diesel over gasoline finally the smog cleared enough monday car free day spinning into big hit bogota colombia was seven straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars this capital city million the goal promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators faced fines this was good cause colombia was only protect the people for all fellow citizens new changes are coming your countries weather you like not only for the better some cases the worse well vauban streets german are now being car frees unless you somewhere park home with driveway paris bans driving due smog for safty season and colombia was the same thing with the smog and now with the rain colombia also had protect their people well with paris these advantages limiting cars usage now being taken seriously,2
the article making mona lisa smile the author states how new technology can help students believe this true think true becasue the facial action coding system actually works then can switch the students lesson and help them learn one reason think will work because student personally tend get bored and doze off and get distracted also know this happens other kids because too because when bored look around the room see all the other students who are not paying attention student were tonge mad and the computer sensed this and changed the lesson then that could get the student back into and make them want the work these computers would make the same having perfect teacher there for every student conclusion think that the facial action coding system valuable and every student think they could really help students who struggle with being bored and just not understanding things school the end,2
many people believe the face mars extraterrestrial being although may seem true the face natural landform there are many facts show this natural landform many scientists have seen this face life mars some conspiracy theorists have said there life mars and nasa trying hide from the people mars global surveyor flew over the face but they revealed there was face seen there was only natural landform scientists have began lose hope ever seeing the face again they were ever able find the face again they would have money more investigation although there were extraterrestrial beings people still believed the face would soon appear again scientists are still trying look for ways explain all researchers are still looking for the face mars scientist jim garvin states there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were comparing airplanes pyramids and small shacks the face which longer there this statement proves that the face natural landform many landforms earth form then after years even decades they decay down nothing although landforms are always forming they are also being destroyed without oxygen mars there way the face able survive although the face not real and natural landform researchers will stop nothing prove real conspiracy theorists are still trying find the truth little they know the truth has been revealed the face just natural landform,2
car horns are blasting through the busy streets alongside the yelling and the stress getting work time the fact you have hear the noises while trying get work creates even more stress maybe some anxiety this does not seem like ideal place right well reality this how miami most the time along with the increasing heat from air pollution course but can there way stop some these situations from happening frequently actually there could were limit car usage the united states least miami could help prosper city and people start off with the trend having car license decreasing these days the end car culture says but america love affair with its vehicles seems cooling source why that could because the younger generation not interested getting their license the excerpt from the end car culture states study last year found that driving young people decreased percent beween and source meaning that young adults the united states are not piling into the dmv just get license also this trend not only america other places around the world are also limiting car usage thus showing that this goal that can achieved this day and age addition relieves stress and air pollution for example german suburb life goes without cars heidrun walter who said media trainer and mother two who lives vauban germany says when had car was always tense much happier this way source which shows that some people like the lifestyle limiting car usage also this could used alleviate air pollution which can stress some people out for instance the excerpt from paris bans driving due smog mentions this interesting fact after days near record pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clean the air the global city source which you can imagine would stress people out for the first few weeks but since can adapt new environments can become part our daily life add the excerpt also said congestion car traffic was down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog the smog cleared enough monday source also car free day spinning into big hit bogota says the goal promote alternative transportation and reduce smog source what does that mean means that after limiting car usage also helped clear the smog that surrounded paris and helped bogota well this can actually help achieve our goal trying stop air pollution hence will also help emotionally and globally conclusion limiting car usage would good idea can decrease the numbers air pollution stress and our number young adults geting their licenses have been decreasing the question should asking ourselves why didn this before,3
the electoral college has been used for many years most people think that place and not process well process the electoral college the selection electors for the process they need electors for electoral votes each canidate has their own group the presidential election held every four years elect keep the same president for years think that its the way vote and its worked for many years why fix its hasnt had problem yet the electoral college well known and has always been the way pick our president its non democratic method selecting the president the other side who are for popular vote think that the electoral college unfair and that there not certainty fair outcome say that the outcome isnt fair then how are suppose win president having more votes canidate not fair but thats how you win having more votes opinion that why would losing fair thats the point one canidate wins and one loses couse the other person who lost would have anger and therefore upset and say that the electoral unfair judgement the candiate wins because the majority vote their designated states the other canidate dosen have many states could only win the collected vote within the states that she has popular vote would awful and much harder process that would mean that every one the united states would vote who they want and sent the capital see whos victorious popular vote has process strage base plan vote and what states dont like this idea they revolt against the goverment states might get together with there senate and riot order stop this opinion popular vote messy controversial and just down right uncalled for there plan within the electoral college and think that they should keep was has been working yes are evolving whole but somethings are left the same and not tampered with,3
scientists want study venus for variety reasons seems they have discovered valleys mountains and craters venus surface nasa seems working several ideas for machines down venus surface well nasa working few different projects for going down venus surface one these projects set simplified electronics made coated with silicon carbide this material proven simulation chamber able handle conditions not unlike those the surface venus have able handle acidic rain lightning stikes and extremely high temperatures fact but why would anybody even want study venus brutal over their well scientists think that long ago may have been earth like planet this where the mountains etc come because earth and venus both have these rock formations the atmosphere almost carbon dioxide which could have come from severe global warming which brings the temp slowly heading that way people mars long long time might making these same observations about earth maybe they already did long long time ago either way nasa wants able make closer observations about venus they think hovering miles above its surface would still temperatures around which still pretty warm you want lot but the radiation levels won unlike that earth and the air pressure would about that sea level earth rough living but fairly survivable for humans live again venus tough planet atmosphere absolutely crazy dangerous there lighting earthquakes and freaking volcanoes plus atmospheric pressure times that earths but yeah definitely great get some those rock samples gas samples from venus think definitely planet worth studying,3
the face mars was big controversy throughout the and still popular topic conversation many people believe nasa was trying hide alien artifact saying land form and others believe thats all linformation nasa has been photographing this for years trying figure out exactly what and trying satisfy the conspiracy theorists they were taking photos region planet and discovered this strange formation with the look face nasa continued research and take photos after years photographing and talking they finally figured out nasa discovered that what many people thought was alien artifact was actually just linformation from the beginning the nasa workers had two theories some scientists thought the face was alien artifact and most thought was mesa which natural land formation the second theory was right that all was was strange land formation and bad camera quality there are photos that show the pictures they took the face one was that was time where most people thought was alien artifact because looked most like face because the blurry quality addition the next picture from showed was really was just land formation the third from proved people who thought was from aliens wrong you examine the photos closely you can see that there are cracks the land that angled the right way with clouds the way can show the illusion normal face features like eyes and mouth comparison that the photo taken obvious nothing more then land before the photo people still thought was alien artifact article stating that meanwhile defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars proves point why would nasa not want there aliens other planets when would benefit them positively nasa really thought there were aliens why would they show the photos the whole world when the first photo came out nasa stated huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth they put out the photo attract attention mars with that caption explains what the formation and how may mistaken something other than rocks what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte landforms common around the american west it reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin thats lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars the study was over and they stopped photographing the face once everybody understood what was this paragraph scientist explains the mesa and compares landform earth the end the face ends just being linformation though many people hoped would discovery alien life the photos proved that was nothing more then rock formation nasa researched find the land formation and made clear that they also wanted alien artifact all the conspiracy theorists have been proven wrong and the mystery has been solved,5

twenty five years ago nasa found what looked like human face the planet mars early the discovery scientists figured was just another martian mesa few days later nasa presented the image the public the picture definitely attracted attention mars which what nasa wanted soon after the public was let down being told was just natural landform and that wasn alien landform after all however some people would beg differ there always possibilities about aliens and what they space but this not one them the face nothing but natural landform april mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look the face the text states that malin team captured extraordinary photo with the camera absolute maximum resolution each pixel the image spans meters this proved that all this landform was was something similar butte mesa which common around the american west garvin states reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho overall these two landforms are about the same along with the picture the face anything else was mars would seen them with the high quality image the text stated rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size any sign martians was mars would been able see objects such airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks would have been able identified although martians could still possibly out our universe this face mars will not prove that many would like believe this martian mesa but nothing but natural landform landforms like this can found even places earth the mystery martians still continues but the mystery the face mars has finally been case closed,3
the facs facs got your attenion right yeah the facs facial action coding system the facs can tell the person how the the person feels just looking there face like and example the mona lisa they read irs face withe the facs they said was happy disgusted fearful and angry useful but dont think should used classrooms read students reasons why think thats teh facs should allowed school are sometimes people dont want talk about ther lifes school and another reason that would kids personal lifes and the last reason may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel and will there parents going back the first reason that may sometimes people dont want talk about ther lifes school sometimes people dont want talk about ther lifes school kids may think others kids will make them for being sad fearful example kid being scared what other will think them for being scared super kind are bullies bullies most time become the way they are becaue they feel like others will hate them the way they are hey have been judged becaue there feelings lets get into another reason that the facs would bad thing have schools that would kids personal lifes and most kids dont like talking about they home life you may say would take some presser off the kids they feel bad sad and could talk them but some kids that don want talk about and the kids that feel will feel like the sad kids get more attenion will want sad like when was younger used want atencion kids find key get attenion they will want sad the last reason may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel also may make the kids parents feel weird angry becaue they proby dont want people basically spying there kids were one the kids dad would want the school spying kid allots parents feel that way and which schools the school with the facs will lose lots money reasons why think thats teh facs should allowed school are sometimes people dont want talk about ther lifes school and another reason that would kids personal lifes and the last reason may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel and will there parents that why dont want the facs schools,3

happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness humans use emotions express and describe how they feel and because the muscular actions units you can tell when someone happy someone angry when you are happy your body make your lips raise the corners your mouth but when you are angry your muscles around your mouth tightens but why important know about humans emotions there new software called the facial action coding system and this software makes easy understand the emotions others and this all becuase the innovation from prof thomas huang and prof nicu sebe they have goal make humans and computers communicate better way the proces starts with computer that models the muscles the face they use only the major muscles and the six classified emotions something different happens can also called actio units and when there one more movements your face the facial expressions for each emotion are universal huang and this means that even though everyone different all almost the same emotions when are surprise when are mad and some them are easier recognize and some others not that easy you can tell how your sister feeling just looking her face you want ask for favor the first thing you look their face becuase they show emption being angry better ask another time but some others cases you can not tell how that person feeling just looking her face because some people express their emotions more than others and for this kinfe people the new software really helpfully everyday look other persons emptions every day and maybe sometimes don even realize some cases another persons emotions can change yours for example you are really tired sad and you see one person that super happy can change your mood happy one think that really smart use the techonology for something good and this one them reading students emotional expressions can help teachers better knowing which type lessons are confuse bored and like this teachers can change make better for students sometimes some students are afraid speak say somethin infront the class when they have question they just not understand but with this software teachers can improve and this students can also improve most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication notes from drr huang even try figure out the emotions someone can some them keep them really well inside this software makes easy think they should use every school help students that have stay after school pay tons money for tutoring because maybe not that they not understand that the way some students learn different they not learn the same ways but with this kind information the teachers can make easier for everyone,3
the article the challenge exploring venus article that talks about the idea exploring venus the article mentions plethora challenges that come along with exploring venus the challenges include such things carbon dioxide atmosphere clouds highly corrosive sulphuric acid atmospheric pressure greater than that earth and many other things however the author still thinks great idea explore earth sister planet happen one the few many individuals who think supports his ideas very well although venus not the safest place explore the author points out ways which can done mentions nasa idea allowing humans float above the fray way see what venus when says above the fray saying that could just place blimp like vehicle that hovers about miles above venus treacherous landscape this could work because the author mentions jet airplanes fly higher altitude order avoid dangerous storms storms that could knock them out the sky and send them crashing the ground the author also points out some interesting caveats that might prevent from doing anything scientifically productive they mention how just simply floating above venus only allows see only limited amount stuff the planet this would due the conditions the planet such the atmosphere being too dense allow light penetrate they also mention how researchers would incapable taking samples things like rock gas luckily scientists are working innovations possibly groundbreaking that can help achieve actually productive exploration venus one such innovation simplified electronic that made silicon carbide this put test chamber that simulates the conditions venus the researchers are also looking back old mechanical computers which aren whole lot like the computers have today and are more resistant extreme conditions unlike our computers these computers make calculations using gears and levers conclusion the author supported his claim well that can explore venus despite its dangerous atmosphere they rightfully point out good technologies that can used circumvent the atmosphere and still able have productive exploration example such the old mechanical computer,4
having machine called facial action coding system cool dont get wrong but having classroom full emotional teenagers not very good idea not good idea because for one one wants everyone know how they are actually feeling they want them think they are okay when they really arent secondly their really nothing when teenager out lesson very tired lastly the computus could wrong you cant trust everything computer says you having computer read teenagers emotions pointless are all have mixed emotions you could happy one second and angry the next minute you just cant control your emotions sometimes with the computer reading your emotions some kids might get mad and say thats lie cover how they really feel teenager wants anyone know how they feel unless their best friends would you want everyone see how you actually are and then everyone try and comfort you your more sad than happy know would not like that one would secondly bad reason have computer tell your emotions because nothing going stop you from being tired bored when your out your out out trying make stuff more fun get you awake louder will just annoy the person much teenagers stay late all the time their phone playing video games just hanging out with friends having bright lessons loud lessons can really make teenager angry and they will throw big fit and get kicked out class computer had tell that was tired and bored and now she kicked out class teachers can already see kids are tired everyday and bored but you have teach the lesson even they are passed out bored its part highschool computers changing the lessons could basically mean that they can stop hiring teachers because machine can teach the lesson and make less boring classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could mortify the lesson like effective human instructor you cant just get rid teachers everything online could just make distracted and anything else ive always heard since elementary dont trust everything the internet why should the teenagers trust the computer when gives our percentage happy mad sad the computer could have glitch someone could around you and picks both your emotions and adds them together even though the computer described the mood for mona lisa shes percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry you cant beleive that that was painted long ago you dont know actual emotions its just picture anyone can act how ever they want photo trusting this computer percentage would hard can play mind games you saying your sad then your mind will believe your sad then your sad the rest the day your mind plays tricks you those are the reasons believe having computer describe our emotions pointless for one every teenager has many emotions right now secondly trying make the lesson more bright loud wake kids might make them angry lastly you can not trust everything the internet computer,3
think the facial action coding system valuable classroom because helps the student get better understanding the lesson for example student confused about what the computer will detect this and modify the lesson that the student would more successful opinion think this would help out alot the classroom because many students get confused bored while doing work and most the time its because they not understand with the new technology this would limit confused students and may save the teacher the time having explained the instructions again may also prevent the student from giving recieving bad grade the assignment due poreforming poorly although can determine another human emotions sometimes difficult because person might smile you but may hurt inside you may take this the person the person may also have mixed emotions which gives person different emotion instead the correct emotion how the person really feeling however with the computer you never mistaken and can always find out person real expression regardless they are forcing smile not the article states that when person smiles muscles called the zygomatic major will lift the corner their mouth and when person forcing smile their mouth stretch sideways instead upward but how would teacher know the difference they are not aware this this new technology helps out with that and makes things better not only for the student but for the teacher well,3
the face mars real opinion the face mars real here are reasons why the face mars real because can natural landform mars just like have natural landforms earth now may ask question how can ailes make face mars the picture provided seems the face pops out and there evidence that creature could have made face with flaws the article website states thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform understand that people may have theory about the face but hence the word theory theory just guess with evidence supporting the claim but there enough evidence support the face people from nasa have studied the face since first appeared since then people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving just natural landscape how did the face appear there can many reasons how the face appeared mars there could have been storm mars that caused the ground move upright and form the face the face could have been mars since mars was created and nasa just never payed enough attention until not believe ailene created the face mars the face mars real keep that question your head believe this essay has provided enough evidence proving the fac mars just natural landform that just opinion what your opinion,3

when fossil fuels are burned causes severe harm the atmosphere and hazardous society and everything around there are many disadvantages and advantages for using any type reichle and burning fossil fuels cars can take you wherever you desire faster than any other type land transportation but the process traveling your car your car the action burning fossil fuels that later will turn into harmful gas which hurts the enviroment around recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses each year every year should decrease the amount cars being used because excessive car usage can big hit the atmosphere and your wallet there are more advantages limiting car usage than disadvantages because humans dont really need cars navigate their way life excessive amount car usage can really harmful well the people driving the streets there are likely more accidents the population cars the streets increase because one tiny crash occurs and the streets are over populated that one tiny crash can now become huge crash with the other vehicles around cold nights france and warm days caused the warmer layer air trap car emissions and due this lots smog was created and the roadways were shut down its lack vision this could been provoked diesel fuel was over used france limiting car usage great factor because there happens less car accidents will occur the action global warming will decrease money being spent gas will decrease and our atmosphere would all gassed with burned fossil fuels many people also suggested that everyone should cut down the car usage and all the fossil fuels being burned because causes lots stress heidrun walker mother two and media trainer stated when had car was always tense much happier this way result walkers statement many people agree with her because when you have car you have worry about buying gas and what you dont have money for gas what you dont make time and you need pick your child there are many what and problems when having car when not having car you can save lots money your bank account you can take care the atmosphere not burning and using fossil fuels and you can decrease the percentage you getting into severe car accident limiting car usage brings alot advantages yourself and everyone around you and also some disadvantages many people can benefit from not having limit the car usage because can save you lots money and take care the enviroment your living there are many solutions get somewhere rather than using car that when using fossil fuels harm the atmosphere raise the percentage global warming limiting car usage can help save the planet cause less deaths around the world save money reduce the percentage global warming and allow living things breath oxygen and not harmful gasses that can hurt the respiratory system,3
have you ever wanted much more cooler and not boring teacher the use the facial action coding system read the emotional expressions students very valuable because can helo teachers understand how student feeling and possibly what causes them feel the way they are having facs can also help because student comes class because bad day the teacher can try comfort them student bored this system will also help because maybe then teacher will switch the topic and try make more fun for students second reason why facs also valuable system may also help save marriages and relationships because one someone partners isn being expressive they can easily find out how she feel and find way solve the system might alos help bring more family and friends together one and help each member communicate more better instead arguing being distant keeping quiet about something someone third reagon why facs helpful system human society won have walk around public with fake smile their face try somone they not human society may more understandable other people feelings and think about what the inside person rather then what showing the outside conclusion the facial action coding system valuable system because very helpful when comes emotions and will help others who have trouble expressing themselves someone something this system may help people have better understanding others and why they might acting certain way,3
dear state senator argue the favor keeping the electoral college think that really doesn matter what single person vote can one vote will not make difference the state uses the americans vote see what would peffer every vote important person makes counts that personally think its waist time vote that americans really have say bet that all didn vote this next around would still have president all because what the important people want all electors know who better for the united states america why vote the only thing against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor back segregationist the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors with the new electors who would oppose john kennedy that popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone kennedy the electoral college widely regarded anachronism non democratic method selecting president that ought overruled declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner the advocates this position are correct arguing the the electoral college method not democratic modern sense the electors who elect the president not the people when you cote for presidential candidate you actually voting for slate electors you might well just let the electoral college the job mean you want and vote mor power you but like said its waist time thank you for reading ashlee,2
was nasa scientist discussing the fase with someone who thinks was created aliens would tell them that the face was not mad aliens because could bin made dust and wind deild person from millions years ago also can rock formed face first think that the face could ben made dust and wind along time ago because not know what was mars for long period time untill invented satelites rocket ships and space shuts next say could also ben deild person one the reasons say this because space deild bode can not row reproduces last but not lest rock could den formed medeo crash thes are some the things why think could not aliens,2
think would with the idea developing cars that are driverless because how functions what uses and why use how works that its just normal car but drives all itself think thats good thing because lets say family has huge celebration and they forgot something the store well can let the car get the things that they need without leaving the house miss anything the car uses huge amount battery power and goes get the things from the store the car also uses fuel half the fuel that use today these cars thats going built the future going save alot money and will not effect our ecosystem and not waste anything what uses mainly under alot wires but mainly runs big battery that charges all night and runs all day without having stop gas stations and refuel everytime plus the car has use gps sensor find out its surroundings the car like paragraph states that uses laser beams form constantly updating model the car surroundings which smart idea because there something nearby and sensor and warn the driver the final thing that want talk about the driverless cars why use back then they made special track that only smart car can drive and they wanted put magnets the road the car can track the positive and the negative the car will not get into crash whenever most people are driving their hands start weaken and they get tired whenever that person tired they can rest their seat and let the car the rest but they say that something wrong like construction wreck going then the car warns the driver and the driver has get out the way what going the road conclusion that wanting the driverless cars invented because can cause great effect everybody and the economy there are some flaws about but there are many other things that great about the driverless car that google has made well some other manufactures this can change the economy and the world the future,4
venus also known the earth twin similar earth many ways which why also has benefits despite the dangers they may encounter the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers how the author shows that similar earth and how has improved over the last few years one way that venus worth studying despite the dangers how venus and earth are similar paragraph four shows the like qualities the two planets has for example the text says astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth this shows the similar features that both planet has another example how that they both has similar geological features towards the end paragraph four states the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familar features such valleys mountains and craters the author showing examples how both planets are similar each other another way how venus has improved over the last few years how getting some technology and how some the features had changed the text says paragraph five venus would allow scientists float above the fray imagine bimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape just our jet airplanes travel higher altitude fly over many storms vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way the author showing that will some improvement this planet which why worth visiting also paragraph six towards the ending that researches are working way improve our knowlege venus overall despite the risks and dangers this planet might have still worth studying the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers how the author shows that similar earth and how has improved over the last few years,3
this technology could valuable many areas the world this technology shows emotions and feelings that humans can tell about other people could used someone got trouble and they needed know their emotions understand how the person feeling this new technology could useful many places one them being police work they could use that find out how some suspects victims feel they could use see the suspect lying his face shows worry fear surprise anger discus all those feelings and emotions could helpful and valuable figure out case classroom would lot less useful would cool tool show students and things like that they could learn how use and understand how was put together science class would good for them try new technologies they can learn what scientists are doing the world they can enjoy learning and trying about something cool and interesting although wouldnt that valuable classroom would somewhat valuable the students can learn how works and try out but also wouldnt valuable because would used for learning which good but meant for showing emotion and feelings and the students would only playing with would good for everyone get chance use and learn about for like week but wouldnt valuable have there yearly round,3

feel like the use this technology being able read the emotional expressions students classroom not needed anyway feel this way because the artifical stated that classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor huang that could useful the computer notices that the students are bored and some confused and then changes now the students that were bored and confused now are amused and understand much better but the normal teacher that have already can that example teacher notice when students are bored and then switch little keep things somewhat fresh and when students get confused the teacher will the exact same things switch some the lesson and explain more just like the computer somewhat side note also feels more natural taught human because its someone who thinks the way you understands you better because they have been through everthing school wise you had chose taught computer teacher would pick the teacher because computer might know everything there know but would make feel way safer because would talking human something everyone used doing overall state that not valuable because the teacher can almost the exact same thing the computer yes teachers maybe not able tell that you are bored and confused but really need computer tell this information because feel like would waste money and time its something humans can already and have been doing much longer than any computer has humans are not exact computer but can help out student and recognize that the student confused bored and much more can help the student just like computer,3

sould take the challenge exploring venus venus difficult place explore for few reasons doesnt include the distance around the corner space terms have gone mars making venus isn the hard part the challenges start with its enviroment filled with erupting volcanos frequent lighting storms and powerful earthquakes these combined features make hard even land their let alone get close landing there venus being close the sun isn what makes hot the clouds keeping the heat makes the temperatures average over degrees another challenge venus presents humanity vicious clouds that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid the atmospheric pressure venus times greater than what experience here earth that presents the problem how get there even submarine who accustom going deepest parts the ocean will get crushed the pressure thats when nasa came witha possible solution the problem their solution use blimp like vehicle that would hover miles above the venusian landscape even thought they are above all hostility venus they are too far away any proper research even see through the dense atmosphere venus more importantly researchers can any reasearch rocks gas anything else from distance without any that they can not thorough examination venus and the vist would vain despite the challenges researchers are working innovations allow our machines last long enough agree that the presented challenge exploring venus worthy despite dangers get land venus one day will demonstrate that humans can explore anything they like complete this challenge human curiosity will lead similar endeavors would also show how elite our space program and how once again will blow our minders landing the moon landin rover mars one day hopefully exploring the evening star,3
dear state senator believe that should change election popular vote for the president the united states simply because citizens our parts working our butts off daily doing things help build the community even clean should able have some type power over who will leading down the road for however many years with popular vote would not only fair but justifiable well helping and paying citizens should able feel have voice this goverment and can make what can powerful change this world truly believe that all was based the popular vote the world would piece everyone wouldn feel like the government others discarded their opinions and just did what they wanted instead they feel like they got good try out and was able fight just tad bit for what they believed right instead being knocked down and told their opinions not matter would also give accurate vote the electoral college minimized people being able vote for the president and majority electoral votes are required elect the president giving the candidates less chance win with the popular vote gives them more chance win the election people should feel safe and secure with whom chosen lead and our government with that being said totally agree that should changed election popular vote for the president the united states,3
accoring the paragraph they are talking about venus how danger and how hot the surface and venus also have the hotted surface even thought mercury closer the sun the author should support his idea like saying build spacecraft that can survival for month venus surface might get study more and only sending machine not sending human venus the hotted planet even thought mercury closer sun and venus and mar earth neighbor this two planet are the closet planet earth our solar system venus the first hottest planet our solar system long ago venus use have ocean like our planet earth venus almost like earth have some feature and nasa also think vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape like our jet airplane travel higher altitude fly over many stroem and vehicle hovering over venus would avid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way the miles above the surface the temperature will still around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure will close the sea level earth and nasa also saying sending human into venus,1
nasa viking spacecraft was circling mars when spotted what appeared likeness human face region called cydonia over the years there has been speculation that this face was created aliens but over the years new equipment has revealed the face for what mesa there are three key points evidence that disprove the alien theory the equipment first used photograph the face mars rudimentary compared the equipment used for the image the sky was clear mars when the image was taken and earth has similar landforms its surface for example each pixel the image spams meters compared the meters per pixel the best viking photo technology has advanced much from since and image clear example the image also has another detail that can left out was taken cloudless martian day last piece evidence sure disprove the alien theory the fact that earth has similar landforms its surface the face mars the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west conclude the face mars was not created aliens the image from was photographed with equipment that rudimentary compared the equipment used for the image the martian sky was cloudless when the image was taken and the image proved that the face mars the martian equivalent mesa something commonly found earth,3
driverless cars are the future there are many reasons why driverless cars will normality for the future few examples are that they will take less fuel and that they will more efficient for someone who always pressed for time with technology advancing more and more each day soon many people will own their own driverless car driverless cars will significantly more beneficial than manual cars driverless cars will take lot less fuel with fuel prices fluctuating they buying fuel each week can very inconvenient there are already some solutions this problem but the driverless car just another will take lot less fuel you can quit wasting money and time say you wake late for important meeting and not have enough time eat breakfast you have driverless car will lot easier for you eat the car without having worry about driving all the same time this car will save time for everyone and will make lot safer things like change the radio station check your phone while your driving driverless car will save you time and will allow put focus thing other than the road therefore being safer you might say that driverless car still illegal most states this because still has not been perfected the developers are still working ensure that driverless car safe enough the road all times all situations when states see that the car just safe not safer than manual car the laws will most likely change accomodate driverless car not there will many studies evaluate the saftey the car and statistics will show that there are less collisions the driverless car the states that still haven passed the law will most likely pass this point driverless cars are much safer fuel efficient and time efficient when they are released the public they will the next big thing they will the better option for everyone driverless cars will here soon and the world will much better place,4
despite the dangers the author believes that studying venus worth pursuing because can help understand more and know what the planet venus was like years ago paragraph the article the challenges exploring venus the author states that venus often refered earth twin since the closest aside from mars looking earth when comes density and size the author feels astronomers may find existing life forms since most venus was probably covered large oceans and venus still has some look alike features earth such valleys mountains and craters since venus the nearest planet earth many astronomers also believe venus could our option for planetary visit the planet safe for humans survive anyway paragraph the author states striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet istel but also becuase human curiosity will likely lead into many equally endeavors meaning traveling venus could have some good surprises waiting the author also states that very paragraph our travels earth and beyong should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation meaning all for dangers long able meet the very edges imagination and innovation quotes,2
professor thomas huang the beckman insitute for advanced science the university illinois has been collaboration with professor nicu sebe form the university amsterdam they have changed how art looked and hope expand into everyday life they want for for the connection between humans and technology the use such technology read the emotional expressions students classroom may change how the school curriculum leading missing lessons risk teachers losing thier jobs and how high the price such technology the student does not like the lesson the computer program may inform the teacher this may lead the school board taking out important lessons that will help the student later life but how are they supposed teach the student does not like the lesson per say the student finds nothing the lesson interesting the student will most likely learn nothing that leads the student not being succesful the future merely because they not learn the key lessons due the fact that they thought was boring the computer does end changing the way the student taught then the student will most likely get the idea that life things will altered fit thier ends and desires when unreality that not how life works the student will sugar coated with all these advantages and have change character not only does put the risk the student future risk but also the jobs the teachers the computer alters the teaching done then how will they know when help the student the computer program will eventually become the teacher putting the teacher out job already not have high unemployment rates the article huang predicts that then could mortify the lesson like effective human instructor par huang gives off the idea that the teacher will longer human but rather computer sure may alter the lesson but that teacher put big amount time into that lesson only for change then what the point lastly the whole cost installing face reading technology can come big price many schools not have that kind money thier funding know that school most definitely does not have the money supply all the computers and laptops with this type technology not even students home can handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile but can write down some simple instructions that encode different emotions par basically not only would the school board spen lots money installing the technology but also buy new computers that can handle such algorithms including the student order get taught thier pace and style would have spend lot money this technology conclusion the use the technology read emotional expressions students the classrooms not valuable due the risks and failures that come with such technology can have negative impact students teachers and others also doing would invade individuals privacy,5
the facial coding system new computer that can recognize and calculate your emotions based subtle facial movements the software produced professor huang and professor sebe works constructing model face and classifying based six basic emotions that humans typically express the those emotions are then characterised movements the facial muscles opinion should embrace new technology but the question how will this change schools marketing and everyday life classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored according huang goes say that the software can modify the lesson like effective human instructor imagine being able adjust lesson the liking the majority students being able create interesting and engaging topics for students and teachers enjoy not only that many students will experience depression anxiety during their middle school high school life this computer can help consultors help those students more effectively overall schools could see massive change students moods after introducing this software schools wouldn the only ones take advantage this new technology companys that are trying market and sell their product could calculate what liked and disliked based the emotions analysed after people view their products some people would make the claim that invasion privacy but wouldn want companys sell the things like rather than the things don imagine always having exactly what you like exactly what you need pop suddenly become available the nearest store not only you get what you need companys will able make more money helping the economy grow and hopefully that money makes its way back you someday aside from schools and marketing how can this effect everyday life the articles states that humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday may not able tell the percentage person sadness happiness but can determine when friend excited bored imagine being able calculate your own happiness like weighing your self scale imagine that the software not only measures your happiness but analyses what may causing your stress and how improve person the world may truly becoming better place the facial action coding system seems far from becoming wildy accessible the public but this new computer software will one day change our lives from school companys and our own personal life this technology can one day make life little bit happier,5
dont think the use the technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable because students should least have the right there own personal thoughts students are building all day with other students and teachers that they might not trust like let alone even know students have freedom school teachers make tell students what everything watched students are constantly told what adults that they dont know let alone trust think students should have the right keep there personal thoughts opinions and emotional expressions private they want them unless you know the student danger that students personal thoughts emotional expressions and opinions should kept private they wish until they are ready talk about whatever the situation could have been,2
people should the seagoing cowboys program because just like have been there are lot great things out there the sea started out when graduated high school when friend told wanted trip europe when accepted this trip europe went seagoing cowboy program where got take care animals like young cows horses and mules this helped how take better care for animals besides helping all the animals that could went many trips well one the trips that went was china and also went gondola ride venice italy and city with big streets water even toured excavated castle crete and even marveled the panama canal when was headed trip china when was crossing the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast the united states took two weeks and month get china while was waiting get china got busy because had feed the animals and watered two three times day had check them every hour and report the captain when the animals got unloaded had some time play baseball and volleyball games the empty holds where the animals had lived after last that was happy the trips that went and helped with things will the future,3
believe you should keep electoral collage the reasons you should keep electoral collage because you should let the people who want vote have the right choose who they want another reason some the people think that their votes dont count and the reason that they dont vote because they dont think the precent will move they vote most people dont vote but all they can least try electoral collage also helps you see how many people are actually voting for each person the president you should keep electoral collage because think the people who want vote should have the right vote dont think people could get tell you who you can and cant vote for think you are eight teen years older you should have the right vote and body has the right tell you that you cant vote for certain person just because they dont like that person another reason you should vote because nobody votes they cant elect president the reason why most people dont vote because they think that their votes dont matter they think when the vote when their whole family votes the percent will they just think they are wasting their own time their votes count just because doesnt one percent when they vote doesnt mean that their vote doesnt count final reason why should keep electoral collage because you can see the number electoral votes out each state the people democide not vote for the president they just not care what the world going like when the new president come you like that they just dont vote for reason just because they dont think important for example alot the states only have three votes california has fifty five votes just that one state california has the most votes the whole conclusion think should keep the electoral collage because you should let the people who want the vote have the right because you dont know they change they will still have the rules that they have for the electoral collage another reason you should keep you can show people that their votes actually count and people know which president they should vote for looking the percentage each president going for election the last reason because they can see how many people are voting each state and you can see you are one those people because the state says that there was zero votes ina state and you know that you voted you would able tell your vote counted not most the time does,1
you think that technology read emotions good for teachers and students think that the use this technology would good for teachers use for their students think that had this technology students would not bored disgusted school beacuse boring hard assignments this essay gon na tell you why think that this technology would good use the reason why think that this technology would good use teachers can tell kid happy sad angry suprised disgusted fear and then act how handle them the article the author says that classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor student shy scared ask question the teacher the computer can pick and let the teacher know they could help out the student say that student being bullied but they are too scared ask teacher for help beacuse they think that the bully going bully them more the technology could pick that and alert the teacher the technology could most likely much more than just explained you you didn think that would help out when asked you the first time you think would help out now this essay explained you that human emotions explain and could help out lot the world this concludes essay hope that was able persuade you into thinking that this technology would help out teachers and students both,3
the author said venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers because each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours shows that want more study and get education about venus should upgrade are machines and aircrafts they can survive more time venus and scientist can more and deeply research thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus the venus surface temperature average over degrees fahrenheit venus atmospheric pressure times greater then experience the earth this why can not survive venus too much time not neccessary that venus everything different from earth like the air pressure venus close that sea level earth some things are same between venus and earth but some things are different between earth and venus venus second planet from our sun think this planet can hotter than the earth,2
this article talks about image being able detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions new software been developed that improves accuracy perceiving the emotions others this new software the facial action coding system has promising applications for variety industries this technology can recognize emotions like the leonardo vinci renaissance painting mona lisa she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry the software the latest innovation from professor thomas huang and professor nicu sebe the process beings when the computer constructs computer model the face all major muscles the model must move like human muscles eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements the facial muscles the facial expressions each emption are universal weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions fact humans perform this same impressive calculation every day for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face course most would have trouble actually describing each facial tharit while shows just how much this computer that knows when you are happy sad for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow acording the facial feedback theory emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them conclusion think that this new technology would beneficent for the people because would help know better the people also know about those muscular action units,1
the face mars made naturally did not have the technology that have today the picture then was only fraction pixels that have now this allowed see the picture much more clearer saw that this was just mesa which lava dome mesa are very common the cydonia area side mars which this located plus why would hide this from the public now needs funds that would benefits from this surplus amount money would come would have told the public that this was minded alien monument something and that this was once life cousin mars people would want hear more learn more about this this would indeed reboost space program that was once top the economics suture there respected work april the mars orbiter camera michael malin took picture that they posted jbl website many people where waiting see what would have become the higher solution picture the face many where dissapointed when they found out was just natural landform then april checked the face again many conspires where ranting that there was indeed alien markings the face went the now known mesa they checked every square visible inch and still found sign alien life they said that this very similar the states middle buttes located snakes river plain idaho you now still believe there something out there that built mesa,3
you think going through extreme dangers just study venus worth venus sometimes called the the evening star venus one the brightest points light the sky why would scientist wanted explore and study another planet when they haven even completely explore the planet where they live first all venus the second planet from our son while venus simple see from the distant but safe vantage point earth has proved very challenging place examine closely venus the closest planet earth terms density and size venus has very dangerous atmosphere and surface venus condition are highly dangerous its impossible for human even get close its atmosphere secondly given the facts that venus has such critical living condition considering its surface temperature reach over degrees fahrenheit and has clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid why would scientist still want explore venus our current technology will not let enter venus atmosphere even astronauts manage bypass venus atmosphere how would they even get the ground venus surface temperatures are extremely high impossible for humans get venus surface lastly instead wasting resources exploring new planets and trying get their surface why don scientists waste those resources exploring and discovering more our own planet more than half our planet filled with water and haven explore big part there must lot new materials and resources out there ready explored but scientist are wasting resources trying explore planet why don scientist try solve the problem with global warming those resources scientist are using trying explore new planet cab used solve problems here planet earth conclusion that why don think going through extreme dangers and risk just only study planet where its not posible live worth let use our resources solve problems here planet earth instead using them for trying explore planets,4
the face mars famous landmark you guessed mars many people believe that just natural landform but others believe was created aliens why people believe that created aliens well they believe that the face bona fide proof that there life mars and nasa hiding something from personal opinion believe that just natural landform that just happens look like face think that because think the odds aliens creating face mars out where very illogical this essay going prove you that the face mars actually landform instead actual alien artifact one the main reasons believe that just natural landform because according the article mesas are something that common around region mars called cydonia and since the face was located cydonia wouldn out place for there mesa there the beginning scientists told everyone what really was another martian mesa but was shaped like face but many people noted something that was the article paragraph where said that the mesa had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh explanation for this maybe the mesa was formed certain way that made have these out place shadows because not every mesa alike and some may have different shapes than another also according the article notes that very few scientists believe that alien artifact which means there are someone skeptics among scientists and sure scientists may smarter than the average person but that does not mean they are always correct now move along even more important evidence the pictures the pictures are important because you look the picture the face mars taken you could see that really isn that clear but you can make out face but you look the better pictures and you can see that they whole lot clearer than the ones right now focusing the one taken which according the article was posted jpl website where was revealed natural landform but skeptics again were skeptic always and said that since was taken during the winter which cloudy time mars that the alien markings the face were hidden haze reponse this there were alien markings why couldn you make brief outline them the picture from and how you know for sure that there are any alien markings many questions arose and taken pictures the face became priority years later april another picture the face was taken this one was much clearer than the one due there being clouds according the article the piel size the image was meters and rule thumb there were any alien markings another that sort they would been able seen the picture because the pixels the face mars was got rid its skeptics and now many scientists say the martian equivalent butte mesa according the article garvin says remind him the middle butte the snake river plain idaho because about the same height the face mars conclusion the face mars mesa plain and simple and the main reasons are because the pictures and overall the really big reason many mesas are common around cydonia which where the face located another reason why don think that you should believe that alien artifact there much evidence why isn whenever people just pointed out obvious things the picture like clouds haze covered markings the picture but there weren ever markings the mesa revealed the next picture taken end this essay the face mars mesa not alien artifact many skeptics believe,6
dear senator the electoral college unfair not only the state but everyone the country only few people are allowed vote electoral and then the rest individual whats the point having both does not make sense for the fact that the electoral votes are more imporant then the peoples votes its not fair because maybe the person who received more individual votes would more better president than the person with more electoral votes the electoral college should changed and who ever wins the most popular vote should president because that person may better off start off with the electoral college shoud changed because souare the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defences the system are wrong the author bradford plumer states voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president paragraph what plumer saying that the people who vote dont vote for the president but for the people hawo come with him even though should the president you should voting for does control our country and our future what might happen why should the electoral college voting for the slate electors also source what the electoral college the author state election the president vote congress and election the president popular vote qualified citizens paragraph the author saying that the candidates have electoral votes and individual votes why have both though shouldn citizens vote matter more than electoral because know who might best for the electoral college probably doesnt even listen the canidate only their electors slate which not fair should the canidate who seems best for instead who works best for the president also shouldn the person who wins the most popular vote president source the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong states gore received more individual votes than george bush nationwide but bush won the election receiving electoral votes gore plumber stating the fact that even though gore won buy individual votes bush still became president because his electoral votes this completely unfair though because gore had more the countries attention than bush since won more votes bush only got the attention the electoral college because the elector slate had isnt that wha the electoral college looks the electoral slate how about the public they know what best for their country and the person with the most individual votes then let furthermore source what the electoral college the authored states most states have winner take all system that awards all the electors the winning president paragraph this unfair because the candidates dont actually spend time states they know they wont have chance winning but shouldn all votes count they never know that state wants pick them why not show them who you are the candidates doing the campaign didnt send seventeen states they didnt send rhode island and south carolina including voters the largest media markets didnt get see single campaign now thats not fair because everyone vote should count person doesnt get see then they wont vote but the person with the most votes should win why think that one would vote you never know although these reasons state that switching the electoral college good idea there are some benefits being there source defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president the author richard posner states the electoral college restores some the weight the political balance that large states population lose virtue the mal apportionment the senate decreed the constitution paragraph this states that despite the fact that not lot people like the electoral collage they help balance the votes the states and help continue the rights the constitution this helps with popular vote the states and gets the most attention than smaller states the other hand even though the electoral college evens the votes the obilic what they choose the other candidate then the one that the public chose wouldnt fair not only the state but the other people who choose that candidate and the candidate him herself furthermore the electoral collage should switched that the candidate with the most popular vote wins instead the candidate with the most electoral vote they should win because the person who has the most votes better off with the public sincerely fellow citizen,5

believe that should change the system election popular vote were change the way elect our president sure citizens would more pleased with the over all outcome people vote who they think best fit represent them and give them the best over all outcome when using the electoral college you are not voting for the president but you are voting for state electors would easier simply allow presidents get the popular vote order make the election more fair all around the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system time change our voting methods because the electoral college system outdated irrational and unfair citizens when people place their vote they belive they are putting vote for the president they choose not for slate electors the electoral college very non democratic way selecting your president way the government deceiving their citizens the way our voting method set when people vote they feel sense independence because they are allowed choose who they would like represent them congress but instead once they place their vote goes electors rather than simple vote towards the one they selected you were change the way people votes were counted would easier and faster elect president and get him into office fix world wide problems all three articles least one section has made clear their opinion abolish the electoral college figures such richard nixon jimmy carter and even the chamber commerce have agreed abolishing the electoral college when voting for president you are voting for slate electors but even know who these supposed electors are are votes are being manipulated and are not even aware who doing can not vote for are president without going through electors should able vote for the electors who are voting for are president only fair that have some say everything that going when votes are being placed should informed all that going you were vote for your favorite show but your vote had through twenty different people all with different opinions you would frustrated now imagine that scenario but with something extremely more significant than televison show the president you are trusting possibly the next four years your life with strangers which you have never heard before would only fair could simply change the system popular vote rather than electoral college you switch popular vote more people would more likely vote because they could have more confidence about their vote they would feel free make their own decision and trust would not tampered with stranger people deserve fair vote and with the popular vote that what you are giving them because every living being deserves equality changing the system would not only helpful for citizens but helpful for the congress instead having random members congress choose the president they can work serious issues around the world they can stop worrying about foolishness and their jobs conclusion changing the way people vote easier for everybody saves time for electors and gives people chance see who they are really voting for presidents would have each state and appeal them order get vote belive that what need they would required actually work for position office rather than speaking what they are going and paying someone else elect them should have faith our president and know who are voting for before cast our vote this system seems more fair and more modern the twenty first century this system most americans would agree with end argument simply say think before you act and truly try whats right,4
highly suggested that the electoral college should changed the election popular vote for the president the untied states instead with the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for state electors who turn elect the president the problem with this that when the electors vote for the presient who are the electors they could anybody how would know our president that got choose had fairly well dont instead having the electoral college system should change the popular vote the people doing can know that the president that got choose had fair with all the other presidents that decided run for the position instead when voting being called natural disaster which what known for the electoral college can know voted fair voting with the election popular vote the people the community should have the right this because the fact that each and everyday are going have live the rules the president should have the right vote for the president and the outcome for whoever wins would fair because thats who most the people think should run our country the basic level the electoral college unfair the voters because the winner take all system each state candidates dont spend time states they know they have chance winning only focusing the tight races the swing states official the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational with that being said hope that the decision changing the voting system from the electoral college system the election popular vote and the outcome very positive,3
the idea world where one would buy car because one would need one sounds silly but could very well the way the future new things are developing each day and more people are jumping board with the world technology the idea driverless car forming public transportation system one the biggest ideas the technology industry being able create system transportation that would eliminate the use other cars big step society and the world live today there are many ups and downs this idea driverless car the positive side this idea there would less pollution the air and people who have disabilities could get and from places more easily but with these good things also come some negative aspects the cost transportation would probably even though the car driverless there would still probably fee the transportation just like taxi service even though the car would have been tested make sure can drive with out wrecking there would still the fear the car would wreck for the passengers aboard the car probably wouldnt that great experience also the teenagers the world would giving the freedom they have waited there whole life able the world sourly depended the driverless car and one would buy cars anymore teenagers would not have opportunity drive like they have always wanted even with the new technology this driverless car there would still people who would not board with what about those people would they still able buy themselves new car would manufacturers stop selling them altogether and just start making different models the driverless car for now our world better stick with technology have and wait introduce newer and unfamiliar form technology,3

not single spacecraft has touched down venus more than three decades have you ever wonder why know little about venus and more about mars well one the reasons why not single spacecraft has landed venus because has thick atmosphere almost carbon dioxide blankets venus whic resulted the spacecraft surviving the landing for more than few hours there few scientists and people who believe that the studding venus worthy pursuit depite the kind dangers might cause the athor supports his idea that studding venus worthy when said that striving meet the challenge that presented venus has value not just because the insight gained but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally staten paragraph conclusion should study venus more because will help learn new information also because like earth lot they both have same density and size and also the closest distance earth but most importantly should study because might make discover something new like creature probably and might able discover new rocks scientist decide send spacecraft venus might take decades that find out about venus find way make the landing last longer all all the author has good supporting details about his idea that sure will happen because human beings are alway curious about new things,2

dear senator the electoral college has served for more than century determining our nation new president the electoral college process consists the selection the electors the meeting the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting the electoral votes congress states the article what the electoral college written the office the federal register this means that not vote directly vote for our new president but instead vote for electors that vote for candidate running for office though many individuals are favor keeping the electoral college kept will continue cause problems our nation our presidential campaign will much better change election popular vote for the president the united states begin with the electoral college the cause for many issues our nation presidential campaign first all voters sometimes can not even control whom their electors vote for ergo one may vote for elector our favorite candidate party however don know that elector will back his word and vote for another candidate the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong written bradford plumer states the single best argument against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the sytem allows for much worse consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people this means that the people never know their electors are going back their word and vote for another candidate aside from that their the worrying aspect tie occurring that were happen then the election would thrown the house representatives the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong written bradford plumer states shift just votes would have deadlocked the election tie would have occurred mere votes ohio and votes hawaii had voted the other way this says that those people had just voted for the opposite person then there would have been tie between the two candidates yes those numbers seem large but comparison the number voters that there were those years they small fraction them this shows how close elections are with the electoral college aside from causing issues the united states the electoral college extremely unfair voters the article what the electoral college written the office the federal register states most states have winner take all system that awards all electors the winning presidential candidate that not fair other voters who don vote for the popular candidate their state they don receive any electors additionally most candidates only advertise and visit swing states swing states are the states that usually determine the outcome the election the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong written bradford plumer says during the campaign seventeen states didn see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didn get see single campaign unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors your state you don get watch your candidates campaign previously mentioned each state has different number electoral votes all depends the population for example texas with huge population has electors while maine only has the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid out defenses the system are wrong states beacuse each state casts only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing voters would have much say the representatives from california who represent million voters why some states have more representatives than others just because their population not fair the smaller states true that the bigger states have more people them needing more representation however the smaller states have much say the big ones conclude the electoral college has caused many disastrous factors our presidential campaigns has caused the wrong president elected and doesn give our citizens much voice the election however changing the system popular vote for the president will give people louder voice this nation and will show them that the government cares about their opinion the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid out defenses are wrong written bradford plumer states offical the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments favor are mostly assertions without much basis reality and the arguments against direct elections are spurious best hard say this but bob dole was right abolish the electoral college,5

sometimes having scientist not the best idea scientist discover different things different paces such the ones that these scientists discovered mars this face that the scientists discovered have evidence that just natural landform could also proven that the face that was found mars was not created aliens this face was the face alien and going proven this argumentative essay first off the face that was found has signs being alien because any planet has those wierd funky looking holes right could have been that with the temperature and time those holes could have appeared making look like human face could just simply have been coincidence that happened like that either way could say that maybe was alien just natural landform nobody has been able personally prove because there has not been one astronaut that has went mars and looked with its own eyes the human being has made assumptions about lot different things and the majority the time the human being incorrect because they not have evidence prove that what they said was correct next lets say that maybe the human being correct how could scientists prove that what the human being suspects the article paragraph reads scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had usually shadows that made look like egyptian pharoah this part the reading the author this article are saying that could have just been another martian mesa but that this one had the unusual shadows that make look like egyptian pharoah like says the text could have just been the shadows something that make look like ancient egyptian pharoah could have maybe been that martian that the scientists have said finally this situation scientists might correct again could only natural landform that formed with the weather something different that helps little things like these form there are certain clues evidence that this face could human ancient egyptian pharoah sometimes the human being wants suspect things that are not close correct what specialized scientist can sometimes just probably that the human brain gets carried away what looks sometimes helps pay close attention what are doing looking for the humans good,3

the article the challenge exploring venus the author does not support the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despise the dangers presents states that worthy pursuit study but the beginning starts listing off the reasons why haven done before the text states each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the last trip was more than three decades ago but the landscape itself not safe the temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the pressure times greater than earth put that into respective says that the environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquify many metals that kind environment would extremely hard get especially study the environment dangerous from the pressure temperature and the fact that there are erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes nasa has been developing possible solutions these risks maybe should think them challenges the author wrote one possible solution would allow scientists float above the fray one the problems with this such solution that the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere prevent depth scientific discovery and any sort collection rocks gases this scenario they would have limited vision and temperatures about degrees fahrenheit this not easy conditions but survivable for humans according the author survivable but they have limited vision and can not collect anything study unless they alter their plans and place themselves far more danger nasa working other approaches studying venus such some simplified electronics which when placed conditions simulating venus have lasted for three weeks such conditions they looked older technology well some dating back towards world war the author the article speaks about these things development but gives information how they could used the devices were used like probe getting past the frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land its surface would another added difficulty the challenge exploring venus the article does not support the idea studying venus despite dangers very well talks about the dangers and possible solutions but never what they would able get out those missions study all all the article does not have sufficient data say that the outcome worth the risk,4
good idea explore and worthy pursuit explore the planet venus despite the dangers presents nasa decides explore venus then there could many benefits from one reason why its good explore the planet venus because data explore venus despite the dangers then could bring information about the planet then possibly with that information could bring innovation based what nasa discovered the second reason why its good reason explore venus because the future nasa finds way explore venus because the extremely harsh weather condition then could possibly explore other planets the solotar system without being worried other weather relate obstacles according the cuticle paragraph says that nasa made some simplified electronics made silicon carbide that has lasted venus conditions for weeks even though exploring venus will take long time will worth waiting nasa explores venus and goes succesfully then could cause scientific break through leading science into new world innovation new technology and more sophisticated world all all exploring venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers represent,3
have you ever wondered what would like know exactly what your friend feeling well now you can somewhat omniscient and know exactly what their emotions are isn that neat believe that the use facs facial action coding system woud very helpful and advantageous the classroom setting for instance you were teaching complex calculus lesson wouldn you want know your students were comprehending your lesson huang the university illinois predicts classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this newly developed technology can also applied outside the classroom some examples the numerous applications are internet advertisements and video games the article also states that facs could make computer generated faces more lifelike like video games and video surgery course this technology has its disadvantages for instance some people would argue that this technology fact invasion privacy because one should know what you feeling every single hour the day also this technology new innovation and the article states that your home wouldn able process the complex algorithms facs uses home can handle how know computer school can all all strongly believe the use facs school setting would highly beneficial even with its disadvantages facs will useful school institutions makes math easier learn why wouldn use,3

opinion against the driverless cars why because the cars aren safe yet think use driverless cars there would many accidents the cars won know what even the article says the cars that they have devolved aren even completely driverless says that the cars can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills other reasons why against the driverless cars because all the cars the world has made what are they going with them they keep making driverless cars all the regular cars are longer going use that going lot money people have wasted car that one using anymore another reason why against the driverless cars because people might not feel safe ride them honestly would you want car driving for you the highway late night the driverless cars aren safe yet they can cause lot accidents and problems for you and the company that makes them this final thoughts the driverless cars say they should not make these cars because they are going waste money instead using the driverless cars can use the money many more important things that the world needs like the passage says that only safe car has human driver control all times that all have say about driverless cars should not make them but use that technology and money something else,2
thinking that alien exist mars crazy the called face mars huge rock formation that resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth aliens did live mars why would they want know the survey nasa took april revealed natural land formation found that there was really alien monument all rule thumb you can discern things digitel image three times bigger than pixel size there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were after all the research and different theories scientists finally realized what the picture actually shows the picture shows the martian equivalent butte mesa conclusion with lot research and experimentation you can find out what things really are,2
driverless cars should thing the future because our technology isnt advanced enough our cars aren fully driverless yet but they are their way the car still needs human driver then their still more work done the driverless cars are good idea but continue production instead will have semi autonomous cars instead fully autonomous cars the positive side having these cars that will cut down accidents good amount although the car malfunctions has fail fault then could lead accident not mention that what its not even the car fault what another drivers fault the other thing that could cut down human distractions such being tired something else that nature could eliminate law violations such speeding reckless driving the negative side the thought the back your mind going hope this car doesnt malfunction instead the car may have feature you want drive you can turn the self driven option off and just drive normally the cars have lot safety feature already such automatic braking automatic steering and automatic acceleration will the car know what deer suddenly jumps out the road accident happens front them will the car stop time will become part the incident manufacturers claim the cars have automatic steering and braking and acceleration what the unexpected happens you cant program car how react for the unexpected you dont even know what the unexpected yourself driverless cars are invention that nearly complete but manufacturers still have some innovating the cars have their ups and downs but the question will they able stand the test time wear and tear lot factor play driverless car and the manufacturers have know everything about these cars before they send them out for consumer use kind hard trusting life with car that doesnt have driver,4
facial action coding system also known facs new and revolutionary technology that can recognise emotions this new technology was invented huang huang created this amazing technology people would know how others are feeling they can get help even goes and says that could use sumpter classes would good idea the answers yes now the reasons think its good idea its because can help the student actually enjoy what they are learning the reason that can help the student because they feel bored classroom the computer would notice and would take action for instance could change the lesson and that what huang predicts the paragraph says then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor that why bilevel would great idea for those computer classes conclusion facs great technology that should use help others and know how they are feeling because just saw this something that usefully and that could help human communication nonverbal and that includes emotional communication that why this piece technolgy could and will usefully,2
cars can good thing bad thing they good the way that they help you get from point point quicker then you normally would but overall they bad for the enviroment this why limiting car usage can have many advantages not only will help reduce pollution but can also help you get closer people the community and even the world and overall makes the world better safer place limiting car usage helps reduce pollution the world example this paris banning driving smog yet getting rid the ban cause eventually the smog cleared source this provides proof that limiting car usage can reduce and prevent some pollution additionally limiting making the world lot less polluted especially people were follow paris example and put temporary ban cars reduce pollution and considering just paris having and helping them reduce pollution safe say having temporary ban all cars around would have huge impact the world and the pollution something else that would advantage limiting car usage getting closer people around the world the reason being the fact you and other people would more obligated use walking bikes means transportation and doing that you seeing other people more often turn allowing for more chances talk and get know others example help support this that source they say how bogota columbia they had car free day and even though raining didn stop people from participating they also mention how guy named carlos arturo said good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution rode two seat bicycle with his wife also limiting car usage make the world better safer and more manageable place begin with there wouldn much car accidents danger being hit car additionally would probably make people feel more relaxed and happy example back this would when heidrun walter said when had car was always tense much happier this way conclusion limiting car usage has many advantages from reducing pollution getting closer people around the world making the world safer better and more manageable place,3
think clear world smog pollution just beautiful day everyday now wouldn that nice what told you that you can make happen easy snapping your fingers this thing you have drum roll please not using your car know sounds crazy right now but let tell you about all the good that comes out and maybe just maybe you change your mind now most you know there alot pollution all over earth and this pollution caused alot things but the two main reasons are cars and power plants pollution caused cars affects alot things including greenhouses when smoke from car reaches greenhouse produces gas that negatively affects the enviroment your probably thinking that big deal because theres not alot greenhouses but that where your wrong elisabeth rosenthal says passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states another thing that caused cars smog robert duffer the writer paris bans driving due smog wrote that paris typically has more smog than other european capital last week paris had micrograms particulate matter per cubic meter compared with brussels and london reuters found congestion france was down percent after almost week intensifying smog they had stop using cars course but was the only way get the smog down now that talked about the bad stuff caused cars let talk about the good that can come out not using car much not all alot people who participate not using car weather was for day for forever have said that reduces alot stress and air pollution lower air pollution makes for more clean and clear air which means you get see the day better than before and who wouldn want that overall not only helps you but also helps the planet you live give walking try you might even find seeing nature around you better than driving,3
this picture the right shows more and more detail the years starts get more and more focused when the cameras improve this one the reasons why can aliens you see throught the years the world has devolved better technology made better cameras and have found out way make things even more clear the picture appears blurry doesnt look focused all what trying say that this could not have been clear first and that they didn know what they were seeing first could have been there the whole time the texts states what the picture actually shows says what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west this landform garin states that reminds him most middle butte the snake river plain idaho people have seen this types landforms earth too and there aliens earth they have said lava dome that takes form isolated mesa the text says that scientists figured was just another martin mesa they even said was common around that area cydonia the only thing that was different was that had shadows around that completely normal for shadows appear according the research have learned believe that this was not made aliens believe that this landform there scientific proof that alien had decided make this there actual evidence,3
driverless cars are not good idea they are just another way end having more fatalities each year people can barely drive cars now how that having robot drive them will make our lives any better already have taxis which gives people jobs invested driverless cars that would just rid people their jobs here are few other reasons why driverless cars are not good idea first off the cars are not even truly driverless paragraph says that google has cars that alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues what the passenger fell asleep trusting that the car would its job there are many things that could wrong situation like that would not trust that would end well second they might put cameras the car stated paragraph not know about anyone else but would not want someone watching the whole time was driving that invasion privacy and should illegal finally the technology could clearly fail which said paragraph innocent passengers who are riding the vehicle could mistakenly blamed for accident and would wrongly responsible for something they did not conclusion driverless cars are just bad idea they would put people out job and they are not fully self driven they will invade your privacy and could cost you lot money you are blamed for accident,3
driverless cars seem the new thing now days everyone wants one totally for the whole driverless car thing feel like had driverless cars that would protect much better would better for the earth and the cars would get more gas mileage had driverless cars think about how much safer our world could just think about think about all the car accidents that happen all the time result drivers simply not paying attention now had driverless cars the number accidents would down whole bunch driverless cars have sensors everywhere them interior and exterior that could keep people safe driverless cars would lot better for the earth also the reason why they would better for the earth because they not have burn much gas which means less pollution the air the last way that driverless cars could benefit because driverless cars get way better gas mileage paragraph one the author says the cars sergey brin google cofounder foresees would use half the fuel today taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus driverless cars seem like such good idea for this world sure everyone would love have car that they could feel ultimately safe that better for the earth and that gets better gas mileage because let face one likes spend whole lot money gas all the time these cars could literally help and improve all our lives,3
exploring venus wunder why venus called the evening star think venus sometimes call the evening star because its bright planet and shine like star its the second planet from our sun and venus referred earth twin because venus the closest planet earth was astronaut would love explore venus because would fun walking venus most people should join venus just see how look and how think nasa our jet airplanes travel higher altitude fly over many storms into space and explore many plants the national aeronautics and space administation have done great job when they into space and discover planets think very cool other planets venus sometimes closers mars the earth rotated its self and people dont incited the sun the hottest planet the solar system over degrees long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth but venus one the best planet the solar system,1
think that the facs good idea feel this could useful many ways the public especially think that benefit towards the teenage community believe not there are massive amount emotionally damaged teenagers that have hard time expressing how they feel the could make huge impact people that have gone through emotional tolls their lives and don know how express how they feel would finally have outlet this could major use psychiatrist with patients that have hard time expressing themselves not only could benefit you home but could great use school such when you class and you don understand the lesson the facs could recognize that you are confused about the subject and simplify for you say your being bullied and you are scared tell well the facs could sense that and help you with the situation,3
have you ever heard seagoing cowboys well seagoing cowboy help out people that have fell the ruins have shipped lot horses young cows and mules over the altantic and sometimes the pacific ship the animals over the sea help lot people you should join the unrra help other people out change their lives think all cowboys should join the unrra could make people have better life then poor when you help people out you feel extraodinary some people say once you help some out you make you day have been across the atlantic ocean times and have been across pacific once still want but have cracked ribs from accident but worth helping others feel great helping other one lifetime experience takes month get china might take while but like you never left because you still feed the cows and horses the plus this you explore preet places china and europe you get experience something you probably have never experienced before these are some reasons why seagoing cowboy belive that you have great time dont mis this chance because you you wont experience any thing that did helping other people out something everybody should for diving helping least someone could make humbugs change,3
this new technology read students emotional expressions should serve important role the schools because humans can detect emotions faces like paragraph five says humans perform this same impressive calculation every day but humans dont pay attention but there was software that focuses strictly facial expressions this would revolutionary product teen suicide one the leading causes death the world having this new technology will save many kids also many families from grievances suicide ties with depression and people who are depressed often smile and say nothing when you ask them whats wrong and likely not tell you how they feel but this technology was around schools would save hundreds thousands lives every day with one advanced product this can detect students low amount happiness and high percentage sadness like for example paragraph how the software would work she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry this will also improve learning the schools the classrooms had this technology there most students may not understand something but since there classroom full people nobody speaks ask the question this software will diminish all that will detect that students dont understand and the teacher will recognize that and modify their lesson the student will not leave the class unknowing subject paragraph explainers classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson therefore for this advanced technology read students emotional expressions this can save many lives and better schools tremendously all across the world,3
being able read the emotional expressions students can innovating many student can have problems but with this technology can solved minutes the use this technology valuable read the emotional expressions students because the student having problems the teacher can help them with their problems the teacher aware what her students emotional expressions are and other students can help other students according what emotional expressions they show the use this technology valuable read the emotional expressions students classroom because the student having problems with their emotions the teacher can help them out according the passage states shes percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry this means thats the machine shows the emotional expressions the student the teacher can see what she lacking and maybe help with that the use this technology valuable read the emotional expressions students classroom because the teacher aware what the students emotional expressions are accoring the passage there new computer software that cna recognize emotions this means that the teacher going aware what her students emotional expressions are going the use this technology valuable read the emotional expressions students classroom because other students can help other students according what emotional expressions they show according the passage this machine can detect facial movement see what the emotional expression about the student therefore this means that other students can help other student lets say for example student percent disgusted then other student can help her feel better this technology could innovating many schools the world can help detect students could depressed have trouble home can help teachers help their students out all all this technology valuable because can help lot kids from suicide many more things because the machine detects that they are depressed the teachers can help,3
that facial action coding system joke all know that there are different emotions going are the school the different types emotions that are commonly school are happy mad sad bored even nuestra question why you care how the student feeling know that the teacher himself herself does not want here what makes them think that students wants here student comes the school the teacher says goodmorning the student just walks past without saying anything let take guess the student not feeling school sleepy even that student might not like the teacher not need facial action coding system pulled out just find out the students feeling paragraph eight states expert faces don lie these muscle clues are sometimes used spot when smiling politician celebrity isn being truthful person lied why can the investigator not the job how suppose done taking everything step step instead getting machine all the job the way how are you feeling now that stating opinion hope you are feeling great because know,3
venus the second planet from the sun has long been known desolate barren and hostile environment venus devoid any potential support humans for the next several million years long story short both manned and unmanned missions venus are expensive time consuming and provide meaningful information that can already determined from earth low orbit probe the author presents the feat missions venus challenge and rightfully paragraph provides plenty reasons keep away from the second planet the surface this inhospitable rock plagued with crushing atmospheric pressure temperatures more than degrees and highly corrosive clouds sulfuric acid vapor the challenge isn much reason toss away millions dollars research matter how large rush gives humanity the author also mentioned the value scientific research conducted our neighbor planet except paragraph they outright state peering venus from ship orbiting hovering safely above the ground can provide only limited insight ground conditions finally analysis paragraph doesn give any information that weren already aware except interesting point was made using older mechanical devices take the place electronic ones could negate the issues imposed fragile silicon chips mechanical macinnes still need power provided batteries solar panels which are controlled computers mechanical computer has just many not more potential issues than electronic one this article fun read and excellent source information about the planet venus but the author struggles find valid reasons there this article fluff piece feel good piece writing were create similar writing would include more appeals logic the challenge exploring venus would have been far more appealing had included more actual reasons venture mysterious planet for science just isn sufficient this particular case,4
viking took slightly disturbing picture face viking found landform that happens look like egyptian pharoah this face was found and started major controversy some people had thought that was fake and others thought that was just coincidence the massive sand storms just created face that all that they thought but can that true the face mars really hit off earth everyone was talking about the face mars has since become pop icon has starred hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows even haunted grocery story checkout lines for years some people believe that this face was created aliens sign life mars but few scientists believed the face was alien artifact that just crazy but scientists are backing there proof for alien made certain people still say that aliens aliens are making these faces that not true without the evidence which there none there are absolutely zero facts that aliens would able make face that there are aliens facts aliens there were aliens how would they even make face this has just natural landform that formed when massive sandstorm hit just coincidence nothing freaky wierd just face the sand natural not alien according the text what the picture actually shaws the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west see nothing wierd going mars least that know conclusion this artifact mars real this because there are facts prove otherwise there were facts than would ruled alien artifact which would pretty cool but isn real and shouldn pretending like real scientists are backing this here they are saying that can alien artifact impossible right now there evidence that alien has made this face the sand,4
you really think that the face was created aliens well not think that first all there evidence that aliens even exist second all there evidence that was created aliens all just conspiracy theory also another example would that says the paragraph that just landform believe that the face just landform like the ones earth first example that the face wasn created aliens would there evidence that aliens even existed ever there evidence the passage but just known belief that aliens have never existed all the history ever another example that believe would that yet again there evidence that the aliens that don exist even made that for instance paragraph six states although few scientists believed the face was alien artifact photographed the face soon could get good shot this example shows that even few scientist believe that the aliens created nasa still tried prove that wasn made the aliens that don exist last reason believe that the face wasn made aliens would that the face was proven just like the landforms earth and didn shape those for example paragraph twelve states what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars this example shows that was proven that the face just like landforms earth conclusion these three examples show why believe that the face was not made aliens just landform like the ones earth there evidence that aliens even exist there evidence that aliens created the face also was proven that the face just like landforms earth believe that the face just natural landform,4
the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presented humans throughout the article the author uses multiple scientific facts support their idea while the facts may persuasive and hard dispute the author seems lack good enough reasoning why humans should visit venus the main strategy the author uses support their claim scientific facts and evidence prove how dangerous venus this strong way persuade people because facts are proven true and they are undisputable paragraph three full statements that inform the reader how dangerous venus the author states that temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these pieces information give the reader sense what venus like terms numbers and statistics case those were not enough the author gives shocking fact prove their point about how inhospitable venus truly such and environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquefy many metals this statement puts the dangers venus into perspective for the reader allows the reader comprehend just how dangerous venus explaining what would happen something from earth were endure the environment venus after reading the many statistics and shocking facts the reader can easily understand just how risky traveling venus would even though facts are good way support the claim the author fails provide the reader with strong reasons about why going venus would benefit humans paragraph four the author states that astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system while this may true the average reader would not become convinced that that good enough reason endure the journey venus possibly wasting money time and lives some scientists others interested space curiosity and the mysteriousness venus are good enough reasons risk all but the average person there needs more logical reasoning the reasoning still not quite strong enough paragraph eight when the author writes striving meet the challenge venus has value because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors again this statement true but not nearly convincing enough because the author described the reader how dangerous venus really they need give very strong reasons why would good idea venture there with that being said the author reasoning journey venus very broad and not nearly conceiving enough the average reader overall the author the challenge exploring venus does not adequately support their idea that studding venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers they provide the reader with amazing pieces information about venus and how dangerous but fail give enough reasoning why the journey would worth these drastic risks after reading the article most likely that readers feel well informed about venus and its mysteries but unconvinced that the pursuit worth the dangers,5
dear state senator the electoral college process not place the founding fathers established the constitution compromise between election the president vote congress and election the president popular vote qualified citizens not thing think this the best method voting the next president for our country feel this way because the people america not really make the decision who becomes president their vote just goes slate electors people may say that the electoral college fair but some the biggest states only vote democratic republican candidates and thats not fair all the first reason think the electoral college should abolished because the deciding factor who becomes americas president doesn come from the people comes from the electoral college under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors the election process should changed election popular vote another reason think shouldn use the electoral college because some states are biased towards certain political groups say california wanted democrat president that person would recieve electoral votes from just one state many states that don have many electoral votes may not even get see the candidates because they only care about the larger states for instance during the campaign seventeen states didn see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didn get see single campaign the third reason think should let the outcome decided the american people and not electoral colleges because the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational because each state casts only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing voters would have much say the representatives from california conclusion think that the electoral college should abolished because the deciding factor for who becomes president comes from the electoral college states can biased towards certain political groups and because its just simply unfair outdated and irrational just like bob dole said,4
would you change history some people think that there some things that were made our past presidents should changed such our electoral college people say should changed election popular vote for the president the united states shouldn change history should keep the electoral college the electoral college consists electors majority electoral votes requested elect the president our states entitled allotment electors equals the number members its congressional delegation now think about this were with this changing thing look how many people would lose thier job therefore the voting was popular vote instead the electoral college literally anybody could become president there isn anybody looking that knows what they are doing after the presidential election your governer prepares certificate ascertainment listing all the candidates who ran for president your state along with the names their respected electors the certificate shows that the winning presidential candidate your state and shows which will represent your state the meeting the electors december the election year without the electoral college make the decision the president the governer can make the certificate ascertainment the other people and there respected electors won get noticed for running other people think that should change the electoral college the election popular vote they think that under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president for instance you lived texas and wanted vote for whoever you vote for slate democratic electors pledged that person the most basic level the electoral college unfair because the winner takes all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states the electoral college widely regarded anachronism non democratic method selecting president that ought overruled declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner but each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the part nominee however entirely possible that the winner the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack democratic pedigree all are practical reasons not liberal conservative reasons certainty outcome everyone president swing states big states and avoid run off election,2
would tell them that was just rock said the article huge rock formation also can prove that not alien because the article states that arrived the red planet sept they went mars take pics the unknown formation prove everyone that was not made alien the nasa described natural formation even though this still left others with questions nasa said the crema board mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face which means that the picture not clear you thought was with the clouds the way nasa stated what the picture actually shows the martin equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west these are all reasons that state that the landform was not created aliens,2
the idea cars driving their own something that everyone believes the future our generations and they are right self driving cars will one the greatest innovations that are coming the near future back then the driverless cars was just joke but now with the new technology have today driverless cars are now something taken seriously sure there are many pros and cons the idea selfarchiving car that runs soley the new technology have created but that risk worth taking the odds selfarchiving car having accident compared person driving car very low using the codes that have been imprinted the car harddrive will most defiantly decrease the odds driverless car having accident code was some how incorrect input improperly then the human driver will have the ability take over the car the human driver must stay alert was driving the car himself secure the safety passengers even more the goverment must now implement new laws laws such who ever sits the drivers seat must mantain focus his surroundings while focusing the road passengers must seated all times and tampering with the car driving system crime these laws will help protect everyone driving and those who are driving driverless car themself the less chance accident happening fantastic but also new jobs will created too coders technical engineers and hackers will need the new driverless car era you may wondering why would need hackers for driverless cars there are hackers that hack test how well piece technology can handle against virus scripts and much more those hackers can attempt hack the driverless cars and they were succeed then they can alert the manufactures knowing that hole the operating system the car filled will increase the safety those who drive jobs will increasing while also boosting the idea the necessity college our generation longer based around office work and difficult labor this new generation going off the explosion technology were slow down the advancement technology then are just slowing down the progress students self driving cars will our next step towards our futures driverless cars will what known for the century new jobs will created the safety others will improved school will become bigger importance and think about wouldn you want own driverless car,4
today technology advanced enough create cars that are semi driverless however humans demand more people want driverless cars for maximum efficiency however letting cars drive for themselves dangerous and the development driverless cars should halted robots are quite common today semi driverless cars are exception however car was become fully driverless would considered robot the artificial intelligence operating the car would like brain making decisions about where turn and how fast needed the surface this seems practical more drivers would needed and robots are more coordinated driving would become lot safer this not true infact drivers were disappear due the appearance driverless cars there would even more problems than today according the three laws robotics robots are not allowed harm kill humans because fully independent artificial intelligence have not yet been developed this law has not come into play yet automatic car was developed then the law would act upon and restrain the robot operating the vehicle for example robot driven car was crash and kill people the car the law would broken paragraph the author discusses how technology fails both the driver and manufacturer would blame now with the driver being the robot more complications would arise proving that independent cars are dangerous danger also comes from another place being other people the robot can prove safer being immune distractions taking place the passenger seats without human driver the car able controlled from the outside hacker were take control robot operated car the passengers inside would fall victim the hacker computer development has shown advanced enough for hacker easily get access the movement car including locks breaks steering acceleration and pretty much anything that the robot would controlling this danger already threat society today smart cars can hacked due them relying gps and other wirelessly connected sources human dependent cars can not hacked due the vehicle being disconnected outside sources and dangers the final major danger with cars being independent that despite being automatic system its reaction speed too slow paragraph lidar explained rotating sensor the roof that uses laser technology generate models the car surroundings this all assuming that everything stationary slower paced animal were suddenly jump front the car pedestrian was trip and fall infront the car would crush the obstacle despite being intelligent piece equipment the car sensors would not fast enough calculate the sudden appearance obstacle the car artificial intelligence would need gather process and use the data all split second this also assuming that the brakes work well enough and can stop the speeding car time whoever whatever was the street would crushed before the car had enough time stop itself this also goes back the danger driverless cars killing people except this time danger the car surroundings legal issues woud arise and the robot would take the blame however people have the tendency hurt other humans the manufacturers would blamed for not having better sensor the development newer sensors and faster computers would increase the cost the driverless cars and decrease its practicality driverless cars would create many issues and potentially the number one leading cause death developed countries these three points are just some the dangers driverless cars the development this kind technology practical but risky however the development new automobile and transportation technology will not yield its dangers people are willing sacrifice and explore dangerous things the outcome tempting enough advancements and changes will take place and soon driverless cars will take the roads,4
the story cowboy who road the waves have support why people would want his job there are many reasons who would like job that you got see the world and travel would like see the world what about you the world wars finaly ended and had span years there was alot mess clean and you had certain person the see cowboys where just the right people luke said the story that was fun job but also hard you got see the world and many activity you had lots free time but was very dangerous even broke his ribs doing luke stated that got see many countrys had free time what wanted all whole did alot good but wasnt home very often and that ment had perman home just traveled think this wound great job for someone who wants travel not have family wants have abnormal life dont know would want this job not all all think would great job,2
the article making mona lisa smile nick alto talks about how this new technology can read humans emotion and think the new techno can used durin class tell how student feeling not only can used during schools can used outside school the new technology can solve many other problems education and personal problems support this idea because teacher can used the new technology take students that don get the lesson that there are being teched can help out the teacher because some students are afraid ask the new technology can also help the teacher know what lesson working and what lesson not written the carticel makin mona lisa smile paragraph class rom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored which could help the teachers modify the lesson like effective human instructor this technology can improve the way learn and make students more interacted learning new things that could impacted many other schools grades new technology that reads emotions not only can help improve education but can also help use bullit relationship between students and teachers which can casus less problems schools like cheating fight get kicked out schools drugs and copying can also help students with personal problems that they may experiencing that effected there education and life style reading there emotions with the new software help the student fell good about ther problems weather bulling some other type problems this new software can improve relationship and education matter what support this soft ware not only becasue can improve education and relationships but also becasue helps out student family member even friend there life make right decision read there emotions and aptitude person which they can fixe ther emotions that impacts there class mate and teacher not using the soft ware would big mistake becasue there would nothing know how student felling about school and what lesson are not work there would also major impacted education growing,3
the use the new technology that can read emotional expressions would good classrooms because you are doing work the computer yit can scan your face too see you are bored happy for the first example wild improve the way students worked they are having bad day could scan there face and show like happy positive things the screen another example will improve everyone attitude and some people could change for the first example classrooms had this technology kids might start doing their work and they wont feel bored because the computer read there expression they could make the work they have the computer fun making into game like showing postive quotes just outgoing stuff general from experience work does get boring the computer you are there for long period time this technology could help improve how kids work another example would how any persons attitude could always change they are just happier mood any student having bad day and they are working the computer this technology could scan this persons face and make them happier putting good stuff the screen could also cange how they act for example paragraph says student confused bored cold modify the lesson and make fun they arnt confused bored those are some reasons why this technology could help out classrooms could improve the way students learn and help them they are sad bad mood anything else,3
dear senator florida think changing the election popular vote for the president the united states would better and and more fair way voting the electoral college may work and all but even the best laid defenses the system are wrong under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for state electors who turn elect the president voting gives people rights and freedom that not everybody has voter wanted vote for president their vote should towards the president not the electors the state all fairness according plumer many people agree with the idea changing the voting system stating over percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now plumer article says the single best argument against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse putting this statement his article trying say that the system have now could all flames the right thing happened get rid the electoral college americans should watch out the electoral college unfair due the winner take all system this system candidates for the presidency don smaller states because they know they won win with those states they stick the big states with more electoral votes with the swing states that what call selfish understand that each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the party nominee however entirely possible that the winner the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote the next president were win the electoral vote but not the popular vote that like saying that only the electoral college voted and not the real voters the people all all official the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational would greatly appreciate you read this over and thought about the topic have addressed you thank you for your consideration sincerely proper name concerned citizen,4
believe that the author did support the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers the story the author talks about many ways could overcome the risky challenges that venus has and what could happen something does bad the author also gives good points how venus could nearest option for planetary visit also how its often referred earth twin and how venus the closest planet earth terms density and size the author talks about how humans have sent numerous spacecraft land venus but none them survived also talks about nasa has been working other approaches studying venus like silicon carbide has been tested caber simulating the environment venus surface has lasted for three weeks that type conditions they keep testing and fixing unproven the project then they maybe one day make another one that can survive that type environment and get the researchers the samples they need learn more about venus the author does support how venus worthy study despite the dangers comes with the author talks about the cons about venus but also talks about how nasa can overcome them making and researching machines that can last long enought understand the type environment venus has,3
are driverless cars good for the future the destruction believe that driverless cars are dangerous human lives because how technology can fail how technology has regard and how can hard use the first reason why the driverless car dangerous because how can fail driving sure don want have the technology fail and cause kill person for example what the car never told that had start driving and went through construction site and killed some the workers there would blood hands the second reason why the driverless car not safe because has regard for any thing not like living human that cares about the surroundings and can think change course need may not think that baby passing the road big enough concern try and stop states this the passage most driving laws focus keeping driver passengers and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that saftey best achieved with alert drivers which goes along with what conveying the third reason why the driverless car not safe because how hard use for some people bring this point because the old people our society should served first they can hardly use windows trying teach them how use car that way more advanced than windows would terrible they would not able know when the car driving and when they should driving those three reasons are why the driverless car not safe might malfunction has regard some people might not know how use,3
scientist nasa can say that the face fact landform made this conclusion when first snapped picture faster the face also took second look and picture and has similarities like natural landform from the snake river plain idaho earth but there are people that think our conclusion this conspiracy theory april for the first time mars global surveyor flew over cydonia picture was captured better than the orginal viking photos they were later posted website for the public see but for the people who thought was sign life mars they were wrong scientist said was just natural landform for the second time the scientist could yet again reach cydonia once again turn their conspiracy theory fact others back earth said was too windy and made the clouds affect the picture this time researchers used maximum resolution camera prove the theorists wrong yet again garvin said there were objects this picture you could see what they were scientist said that the face was equivalent butte mesa they made this statement because there something similar earth the snake river plain idaho these are found around the american west garvin said that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars the other side things there were many conspiracy theorists that questioned nasa claim everyone wasn satisfied with the pictures that were first taken people said was during cloudy season that why there was another trip with more advanced equipment they also stated that the camera board had through the clouds and dust see the face the picture couldn been shown clearly another claim they made that since there were wispy clouds the alien markings could hidden the haze and scientists just didn look hard enough conclusion have the facts that need prove that the face just natural landform have provided the public with two pictures plus also made observations that looked like landform from here earth nasa would like see the conspiracy theorists prove wrong then they could state the facts for once,4
the article the challenge exploring venus the author presents the opinion that venus well worth exploring and well worth the challenges that humans would have face pursue exploration the author does great job explaining why venus ought explored they also pretty good job explaining how can explore venus bypassing the dangers and risks involved however the author does not good job explaining why what learn venus can help humanity this shows that the author does overall nice job supporting the idea that venus worthy pursuit although they could have done better the author uses many points explain why venus should explored they state that venus the closest planet our own and that because its close proximity earth several spacecraft have been sent the planet already although all were quickly destroyed the article also states that venus was once earth like and could have possibly supported life forms today venus still has some features that are analogous earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and caters addition providing this piece how venus still similar earth also states that venus may have once also harbored oceans all these key points help the author show why they believe humanity and nasa should continue our pursuits venus the author also does exemplary job describing how humanity can continue its pursuits venus although the pressure intense and the temperature more than any human could handle there are still ways can get close venus according the author they describe that using blimp like vehicle astronauts and scientists studying the surface can float safely miles above the surface where the pressure and heat are much more tolerable another solution the author presents gets much closer the surface although humans wouldn able physically vehicles such this but old fashioned computers could used help remotely control probe these old computers use gears and levers make calculations not electricity the author puts modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick but tend more delicate when comes extreme conditions these other computers can withstand much more and could help create probe resistant enough study the venusian surface the author does great job explaining and exploring the possibilities however the author bit off the mark when comes explaining why what find venus can help humanity out although states what can find venus and how earth like and the planet closest earth that doesn explain why need waste resources exploring such inhospitable territory venus fact earth closest neighbor and our nearest option for planetary visit but why would need visit the first place venus may have once been similiar present day earth but why does that matter how would study venus surface prove instrumental nasa and the world the article states the value returning venus seems indisputable but besides the fact the they state that earth like and closest our solar system they not back this claim all the author does poor job backing the benefits exploring venus and can not defend why should travel there any benefit humanity conclusion the author does decent job defending his her claim that venus should explored although could have been much stronger they fantastic job explaining why venus unusual and how can explore but neglect provide any benefits reasons why exploring venus important the human race whole however even though the author did not include this his her article still decent article and mostly thorough why and how explore the second planet our solar system the author overall supports his her idea almost completely sound way,6
everyday technology changing for the better there lot controversy about cars whether they should driverless not belive that not good idea for the cars driverless think this becuase humans are smarter technology fails sometimes and will too expensive the idea cars being driverless scary firstly believe that humans are smarter than any computer the world humans know what going whereas computers dont know much computers can fail sense something and get bad accidents drivers also have better senses computer can always fail belive that humans should the only ones driving the cars another reason that think cars should not driverless becuase technology always fails what one the sensors fail and you loose control the car the article said that the cars arn fully driverless what the point also computers can glitch and cause horrible accidents technolgy not very reliable lastly another reason why cars shouldn driverless becuase would cost lot money cars will have many sensors and devises that are very expensive the roads will also need have some seniors them and that will cost fortune the cars will also need lot energy keep all the sensors running which will mean that the battery will need changed constantly and battery arn very cheap belive that will cost much money make the driverless car conclusion belive that driverless cars shouldn made driverless cars will cost toom much humans are smarter and technology not reliable driverless cars will cause alot debt and accidents pointless make them the driver will always need there taking the wheel the cars are not completely driverless driverless cars are not good idea,3
twenty five years ago something funny happened around mars nasals viking spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos possible landing sites for its sister ship viking when spotted the shadowy likeness human face this excerpt from the article unmasking the face mars this describing strange feature found the face mars the region cydonia first there were clear pictures the face and certain explanations the viking found and back then the quality was not great scientists thought was just another martian mesa but they also noted one unusual shadow they were not that clear the reason nasa took another picture better resolution but was cloudy and some people were not convinced that was mesa nasa was finally able capture clear picture the formation putting down any kind conspiracy theories speaking conspiracy theories many believed that the face bona fide evidence life mars some theories were that aliens built egyptian pharoah some the scientists nasa even believed that was evidence alien life mars conspiracy theorists say that nasa would rather hide life mars but defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilisation mars becuase then nasa would get more money mars now with higher resolution pictures nasa scientists have found what the face really seems that their earlier guesses were fact correct quoted unmasking the face mars what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa the scientists were correct saying looked like mesa they have even found out with higher resolution pictures that almost resembles the middle butte the snake river plain idaho they both have similar height and shape sadly the face not ancient alien ruins temple dont all want proof life mars scientists have proved that not though scientists say that fact mesa and they put rest long standing mystery the face mars and any conspiracy theories with,4

dear state senator feburary would want you keep the electoral college the same for its been congress and popular votes from the citizens elect the president and vice president all this time change the electoral college might end having change few more things far the electoral college has kept this country great with its voting way for president and vice president changing the electoral college will break its original way the constitutional compromise between the election president and congress the original way what made this country the way today sure people argued over the electoral college but that was years ago change the electoral college could changing the country better for the country that don change the electoral college plus would save congress senators the president and vice president time and paper work write you later senator sincerely proper name,1
there are lot mixed opinions about driverless cars some are against and some totally support the idea support because think that will easier and faster way get somewhere and can safer which very important and while others are against because can dangerous and involve lot reckless driving which can lead accidents technology these days have improved from before and better now which allows make better technology sensors are very important for driverless car and have improved over the last decade and they can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine which allows better response and control than human driving could manage alone there have been furthur improvements the sensors and computer hardware and software which will make driving safer and leading cars that can handle more and more driving tasks their own even though some the technology needed hasn been made yet some believe that are catching technology necessary make driverless car though the past couple years several car brands have started developing cars that can handle driving functions such they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but they are all designed notify the driver when the car requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents manufacturers are also considering putting cameras watch that drivers are remaining focused the road they are also hoping bring heads display signs that can turned off instantly the driver needs take over the car system actually safety feature which big concern while those who are against think that can reckless driving and cause accidents and can lead conflicts regarding who fault with injuring someone think that time goes technology will get better and advance more which can lead manufacturers making driverless cars safety very important and think that can safer and faster way get somewhere there are manufacturers making cars that are not completely driverless but think that soon will have driverless cars selling everywhere,3
letter state senator into keeping the electoral college well the electoral college process not place its basically compromise between the election for the president the vote congress also was founding the fathers and was established the constitution after that consists electors and majority electoral votes required elect the president our state entitled allotment electoral equals the number members its congressional begin with even the best laid defenses the system are wrong what have richard nixon jimmy carter and bob dole well let tell you the chamber commerce and the afl cio all thier time agreed answer abolishing the electoral college also over precent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now whats wrong with the electoral college well under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but slate electors who turn elect the president before that for example you lived texas and you wanted vote for john kerry you vote for the slate democratic electors pledged kerry also state conventions and the state party central committee also the presidental candidates themsleves can voters ever contrail whom they are voting for answer not always after that segregationists the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john kennedy well its agreed that the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments favor are mostly assertions without much basis reality finally can argue that electoral college method selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has hope carrying thier states democrats texas for example republicans california knowing that thier vote will have effect what ever,2

the idea having cars that can the driving for something are getting close the stresses and dangers driving could eradicated not controling car this point are not quite there cars are not driverless and may cause more harm than good situation that sensors can not yet deal with human control important and relaxing too much can cause problems with that not having think about driving and instead just enjoying the ride something that most desire but the safety these vehicles has taken into consideration driving can stressful part one day and eliminating the need pay such close attention and relax what most people want right now driving involves paying close attention everything around car and features within the car well all this can stressful and hectic and the ability mess and cause damage ones own self someone else property becomes too easy smart cars not only get rid the stresses driving but include safety features that could better that human sensors are the main factor making these cars work and have safety features that can apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage this point smart cars still involve human element with drivers still having take over difficult situations get drivers attention many ideas have come about some such the car entertainment system even allow for leisure and then turn off when driver when they need take over all these features sound nice but really that much safer the cars that have been developed and even the ones proposed for the near future are not completely driverless that means that drivers have stay alert there are systems alert driver but driver relaxed the transition could difficult would not completely stress free ride driver has think about when they will have take over and what difficult situation that would because drivers are expected take over difficult situations google cars aren truly driverless they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents when learning drive may reach point that what primarily being taught the dificult things and when the computer stops working one would just have get off the road drive dangerously could reach the point that teaching people how drive stops once reach the point not needing human driver people become completely the mercy computer and lose the ability drive because don need know how computers can always malfunction and then not even human fault when people die because driving teaches control awareness and even patience computer doing all that those life skills are not readily learned and lost more people these factors not sound any better think should have smart cars but with the right precautions and keeping element human control sensors giving warnings and keeping drivers alert should enough help with the safety concerns stress reduced this situation because driver has the help the sensors but not relient upon either the systems that allow entertainment are too controled computer and cause issues with transitioning between relaxing and paying attention driving driving still has taught and computer dosen work humans still have the knowledge take over without extra danger having humans more the controling but having safety features sounds like the best thing still reduces stress because sensors are used early warning systems and features keeping one alert skills that along with driving are not lost and driver doesn get too relaxed drivers are not completely relient upon device that could malfunction but the help not gone the idea doing nothing sounds nice but just don think the safest option,4

position driverless cars think they are good idea because would make long road trips easier the driver say that because notifies the driver when something wrong they need take the wheel think would make less accidents happen has sensor for when people need reverse the car and makes noises vibrates the seat the car close something also when bmw annouced the development traffic jam assistant the car can handle driving functions mph but the driver has keep hold the wheel the driver would alert all the time they need take control have all this stuff the car like the traffic jam assistant sensors for when the car reverse and alerts the driver when they need take over the accident rates would drop people wouldnt careless when they drove too some people get tired driving they just want their phone well when they have the driverless car all those problems would disappear they would just have alert when the car needs them take the wheel driving may sound fun new drivers but new drivers can reckless and careless would defiantly drop the accident rates the only bad think about the driverless car would something failed than would the manufactures fault their job make sure alert the driver take over and make sure everything works but automakers are continuing their work the assumption that problems ahead will solved they are expecting car that can autopilot the time just have drive that last three different cars are expected able drive all themselves making the driverless car better than they expected,4
the face mars created alien the face mars was not created aliens the face mars natural landform the face mars was not created aliens because mission controllers checked twice scientist figure martian mesa and nasa was looking for viking mission controllers checked twice make sure wasn created aliens the article the author states the first time took pictures the face had through clouds skeptics thought that alien markings were hidden haze the author also states rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were these two details prove that mission controllers checked twice make sure that the face mars was not created aliens scientist figured martian mesa the text the author claims scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egytian pharaoh the author also says lava dome takes the firor isolated mesa about the same hight the face mars these two details prove that the scientist figured was martian mesa nasa was looking for viking they could find viking sister the passages the author states years ago nasa viking spacecraft was circling mars snapping pictures looking for viking when spotted the human face miles big staring back the camera the author also says huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth these details prove that nasa was looking for viking they could find viking sister the face mars was not created aliens natural landform the face mars was not created because mission controllers checked twice scientist figure martian mesa and nasa was looking for viking,3
dear state senator good day senator name adrian and resident this state wrote this letter let you know think you should change the system think the electoral college bad idea because not good determining the winner the electoral college good but its alot work find out who wins the president and vice president seat the electoral college also big complicated system that can technical mess someones chances winning the electoral college basically voting for electors not the president the electoral college not good system use because just like the article the indefensible electoral college says voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate what then can take back our vote this how some presidents win without even knowing messed voting addition idea about removing the electoral college think its bad idea because the electoral college not good determing the winner prime example why the electoral college bad idea when gore lost the election against bush stated that gore had won the popular vote but lost when came electoral college lost said that over those voters wanted prefered direct election instead the electoral college system the article defense the electoral college states things that good about the electoral college like the electoral college avoids the problem elections which candiate receives majority the votes cast this example that statement ixion and clinton both had only plurality the popular votes while winning majority electoral college the electoral college still democratic many peoples eyes and mines the electoral college will always give advantage the outcome the winner the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and thaat those electors could always the will the people the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational the united states most say the electoral college good because its keeps favoritism away but really just adds the election the direct election way more simple and easy find out who wins send you this letter see you would think about taking out but know you probably won see this from adrian,3

agree with the author suggesting that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers present because traveling different planet such venus can explore and find out the history this planet and look clues what venus used million years ago and see there was once life this planet even water the authors supports his idea studying venus despite its danger saying the national aeronautics and space administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans study venus nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray need make machines that would resist heat and the pressure that can have more time explore venus venus surface really hot and the pressure this planet also really high that can melt and crush metals according the article says such environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquefy many metal since venus surface really hot nasa tested this machine that made silicon carbide the passage says for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions conclusion the authors idea going venus may actually come true the near future thanks the idea nasa building these special type vehicles that can last long the really high temperature and pressure venus,3
think that driverless cars should not allowed the becuse they can danger the citizens people this planet they might start messing and might cost lot money repair first think that driverless cars should not allowed because they can danger the people america they can develop mind their own they ight cost too much money fix mechanics may not able fix them they weren trained those type cars another reason that companies might stp making that much gas because would have robotic cars and they might not run gas companies might not make that much money they might slow down producing gas and would just cause lot problems also why driverless cars should not allowed because what thr robotic driver and human get into car accident the judge whoever handling the case wouldnt know who believe probably the human would fault most likely,2
have you ever wondered how someone feeling emotionally you want know they are feeling sad angry even they are smiling well according professeur thomas huang the beckman institute for advanced science believes that can detect human emotions computer model the face observing all their major muscles still can computer really able detect human emotions just looking muscles believe that this new technology called the facial action coding system might not what can actually detect human emotion throughout the article huang refers muscles for emotions they can observe how person feeling states that your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you suprised para also relates the orbicularis oris that tightens your lips show anger para what saying could true but people have the ability control their own expressions someone performs one those expressions what they aren feeling the way they might express another example huang uses the painting mona lisa the article states that according some new computer software that could recognize emotions para the article the introduction asks the intended reader can imagine detecting how people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions intro para throughout the begining the article they talk about what you could detect someone without even knowing how they are feeling but the article progresses they mostly talk about certain muscles that move when you make facial expression which one can actually detect someones emotions even they are expressing emotion can only tell looking their expressions directly what trying say the begining the article they try give vibe that you can detect emotion even when the person has different expression but then later the article they ask you try experiment doing different expressions the mirror telling you how these expressions and saying what emotion you should feeling after you make those expressions they ask doing the expression made you feel slighly happy para later states that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them para this sentence says that may help produce emotions other words they still might not know how you are actually feeling certain emotion after doing expression this article might explain observations like fake smile the mouth stretched sideways using the zygomatic major para but expressions can vary different people not all people are the same others just because someone might look different when they express emotion doesn mean that right away that they are expressing different emotion now know some people might say how accurate technology but computer lifeless device that maybe could detect facial expressions but might not know the true emotion that person this article was pretty confusing they tried get you believe that researchers have found way detect emotion but then talk about how trying different expressions you make experiment show the emotion the person expression they made doing that they make seem like they only know how recognize your emotion just the certain expressions they want you make can technology really detect someone emotions they are trying express different way,4
will driverless cars the new thing would good thing have driverless car don think only because what begins malfunction and get more car crashes out them then driving car ourselves think should strick driving our own cars although these driverless cars are like riding robot humans what they begin malfunction causing way more car crashes destroying more than person driving vehicle itself having driverless car sounds great and thats what all drivers dream especialy elders but you think about could just dangerous even with the driverless car theres still drivein youll have put forth and times like when this get dangerous for the car handle well what the car got you into that dangerous situation driverless cars are bad idea they may come with all the latest technology and much cool gaits but you think about all might come falling apart sooner later the years progress the cars are turning into this like bmw came with the traffic jam assistant honestly there putting cars what get the outside dont think car should advanced developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger the only thing like that they put the car the text free hands while youre driving because you wouldnt all that much danger you would just pay attention you really think about driving safety common sense and the driverless car pointless are driverless cars the new thing will good thing have driverless car dont think driverless car the safest and best thing for this world right now,3

scientist nasa who trying tell you that the landform you saw mars nothing more than just natural landform may look like face but really not what really natural landform that our viking took picture one side mars the picture that you saw nothing more than picture taken the right moment that makes look like that mars has face the reason why looks like has face because the picture was taken the moment when the landform had shadow the certain places the landform make look like has eyes nose and mouth you look the picture from you can see that shows more the face and that does look like face but then you look the picture taken and you can see that the natural landform mars starting break and that the shadow now starting fade away you won have worry about aliens giving out message saying anything bad nothing more than just natural landform and picture taken the right moment,2

driverless cars are coming are they safe for should trust them are they really driverless there are some negative and positive studies for driverless cars should with the negative the positive outcomes for myself personalty going say that wouldnt trust driverless cars its safe for say that against the use driverless cars believe that there may more car accidents with these driverless cars let start with the negative results driverless cars these driverless cars arent driverless some cases the driverless cars still require actual drivers control for example the driverless car has actual driver and needs around accident construction site and how going know which way how get around seems very unsafe for driverless car around obstacle when not having any clue how get around driverless cars are seeming very dangerous for human beings these driverless cars are likely hazards situation for pedestrians passengers and drivers now let get the positive outcomes driverless cars yes having driverless cars makes have less work but driving honestly that much work postive outcome that wont have spend ton money fuel each and everyday some cases driverless cars seem safe its good thing that there will sensors cameras gps recieve and things like that keep things safe google doing good thing human beings just trying richer studies state that google was one the first websites come with driverless cars believe that google only trying benefit for themselves this driverless car concept there too many negative things about for being benefit human beings seems not much good thing for human beings but really good thing for google should trust this kind idea from google any website that matter believe that driverless cars will have huge negative impact human beings this idea not safe its safer just have actual people driving cars instead computers driving for why even put alot money into driverless cars when people will still have control them times its waste time and money whats your thought driverless cars you think its safe,3
agree that driverless cars are good and should used the future they would help out lot eyes from when you are drunk just tired and you fall asleep the wheel when you need take care person while driving also when you lose your focus while driving those will help out just case accident when you are alone and you are hurt bad and you don have enough energy drive the hospital all those things are things that are neccessary and will need smart car for for example when you are coming home from party and you have one else rely take you home driverless car will helpful that situation you know you are going fall asleep the road after working long shift all you would have switch the autopilot for your car when person driving and they have baby the back seat and they need help with the baby then driverless car would help while they take care that baby say husband wife pregnant the passenger seat and they would freaking out the whole time and they may lose focus the road the driverless car will help with all those situations there will need for any worries the companies run enough test make sure the car working right you should comfortable with the car plus company wants get sued for their car because didn what they said would some people daydream when they are driving and forget they are the road driving and may get into accident teens like text and drive even though against the law that the smart cars will help when collision may happen the general motors company have vibrating seat that alerts people when something happening that they should watch out for whenever you are daze and you are coming close hitting tree the seat will vibrate hard enough for the driver realize what they are doing even though the driverless car may need help sometimes trying get through traffic jams and would need your assitance but the car still worth getting considering that can drive itself the time when you are really hurt and would hard drive yourself the hospital all you would have get enough energy walk your car and sit there until you the hospital having wait until your friends family get your house take you the hospital what you can see night while driving then you may need some help trying get wherever your destination some elderly people have bad vision and they might have work that night instead leaving way early just have your smart car drive you there plus you have smart car death rates even just accidents while driving will decrease lot more than you can imagine smart cars will the new and good solution for lot things the future and now from driving tired and falling asleep the wheel taking care person while driving losing focus the road and not being able see night while trying drive also having emergency the point when you can drive yourself the smart car will solve all those problems for you and you won have worry about problems while driving again,4

when sitting class you ever feel like you can read someones emotion well now you can with the new program facial action coding system you can make model someone and scan the face muscles tell you what emotions they are feeling you have six basic emotions that this program can detect just your muscles your face when they scanned mona lisa face she was percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful percent angry now people start turning towards this method telling how people feel instead asking them make them feel better then you are shutting yourself off from society and that not okay you want now how someone feels don make model their face have computer tell you just and ask them how they feel and what will make them feel better amazes you when you find out how many people turn towards technology instead face face conversations finally you scan someones face see you can make them feel better than you are doing all wrong you need walk that person and say are you okay what you need help you also when you scan someones face they can put whats called fake smile and trick the computer into thinking actual smile will say they are happy when reality you are mad upset put down the electronics and focus what important life,2
facial action coding system system computer that takes human faces and tells the emotions that person made from professor thomas huang the beckman institute for advanced science the university illinois the process begins when the computer constructs computer model the face all forty four major muscles the odel must move like human muscles they tested this system the mona lisa painting who was created artist leonardo vinci the system shows that the mona lisa eighty three percent happy nine percent disgusted six percent fearful and two percent angry however they are trying use this technology read students emotional expressions which strongly against for the fowling reasons students should have the right tell rather how they feel not student high school facial expressions are key what kids are thinking students not want say what that student feels they should able keep themselves all students should have the right defend themselves with their thoughts the movement towards that technology get students emotional expressions will start making fight between students add this system very expensive system where schools not have the money for schools need focus more getting more help for their students not finding out their emotional expressions however having this system can help students who are need guidance but the students would rather talk counselor than computer schools should put more that money into new books new activites for the students the students can say well educated and socially active sum the facial action coding sytem system which computer reads humans face they should not use this students for privacy the student and financial issues this brilliant idea towards pictures people the mona lisa not students students have the right guidance consoler for issues they have any but student should not get she face read unless student concentus,4
the national aeronautics and space administration nasa hope visit venus and make closer look the ground often called vetus earth twin cause the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too according the text astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth nasa been wanting visit venus cause venus sometime right around the corner space but every time they sent spacecraft land this cloud draped world spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours according the text the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure time greater than what experience our own planet this type conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth for example venus has the the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar sytem even though mercury closer our sun nasa has been working other way study venus they are even trying bring back old technology called mechanical computer these devices make calculations using gears and lever and not require electronics all unlike today computers according the text some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions you see nasa are really trying find another way study there and how they are gon na live while they are venus conclusion you know nasa are doing everthing they can for way live and how they are gon na study the environments they keep trying they are gon na able survive that atmospheric one day they are gon na make venus,2
cars may have some advantages but the world would better place limited car usage the benefits limiting our usage cars will help improve the environment there are healthy alternatives and not using cars much will decrease stress that people have decreasing our car usage will improve the environment the artifical paris bans driving due smog robert duffer says congestion was down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog france they banned even numbered licence plates from driving for one day and one day was all took for the high levels smog decrease another artifical the end car culture elisabeth rosenthal talks about the decrease usage cars throught the years paragraph says the pattern persists and many sociologists believe will will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment the people keep slowing down using cars which scientist believe will there will better carbon missions the air and the air will better limiting car usage will help make our environment better walking biking and skating are all excercises that help you stay fit but they are also healthy alternative cars artifical published the seattle times called car free day spinning into big hit bogota andrew selsky describes the day that trending all over the world the day cars are banned people these countries this case colombia hiked biked skated took buses work banning car usage encourages people get and walk run bike because they can use their car the town vauban germany car free town people walk everywhere because the town has cars the town where the swish bicycles and the chatter wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor the people this town are walking and staying fit everyday one last benefit limited car usage causes people less stress heidrun walter mother two who lives vauban germany says when had car was always tense much happier now once walter sold her car she was relived she didn have worry about making her next car payment when she would have get gas again how much money gas was getting rid her car relived her stress not using cars will decrease the amount stress society over all limiting are car usage would greatly benefit will help keep the environment clean keep our people healthy and will cause people less stress,4
the article making mona lisa smile nick alto describes how new technology called the facial action coding system enables computers identify human emotions there paragraph where can detect students facial action and the value using this technology read students emotional expressions something can agree with the passage the article states that classroom computer could recognize student becoming confused bored huang after that could modify the lesson similar what effective human instructor could response that classroom computer that has facs facial action coding system can help the students lessons and making them understand easier for example the facs detects the student being confused while doing work his laptop the laptop can try make the lesson more understanding level the student advertisments can help students feel interested what the student and ads appear laptop most ads not interested and intend skip the there are new ads appearing everyday students phone their laptop the passage states that you smile when web appears similar might follow you frown the next will different student depressed and watching video the facs will detect his emotions the facs will insert his her screen that can have chance make the students depression lower down forgotten about depending the pops and the student interested could focus the and won focus much depression there amount students who play video games home afterschool most are their laptops instead console believe that games can cause violence students can have fun with game their but later that emotion can change into something else could change into anger the facs can help that they read student having different attitude that unecessary could make the laptop shutdown for the student take time calming down the passage the facs could work for video games video surgery another thing the facs can remind the student their work first before playing their laptop just like what the mother would their child finally believe the value using this technology read students emotional expressions can help help them more educated helping their lessons emotions and control computers need understand that too huang,4
why you think aliens created aliens did not create this natural landform the face breaks and gets more real each couple years aliens created this then they couldn had nasa mars global survey spacecraft reveal the face mars mesa mesa natural therefor has natural landform think real because they got lot facts about the mesa and was fake they couldn gotten facts they seen image and the note said was human head now was created aliens and then couldn human head think real and should you believe what they say becaue real and they are not making this mesa was not created aliens aliens are not even real the real world believe what they say because think real you dont think real then see you can find facts about maybe even more facts than they found you cant find more facts then them obviously not true about created aliens,2
the presidential election enormous event that almost all americans over the age eighteen participate but there one problem the system use for outdated unfair and just terrible the electoral college needs removed because voters need more power and there are tons problems that come with the electoral college there are some pretty solid defenses for the united states keep the electoral college for example stated the article posner even though some candidates can dominate regions region has enough electoral votes elect president but the thing even though might not enough win the election extremely benefits the candidates race another defense states posner article that the trust the slate electors that you are actually voting for rarely betrayed this flawed defense because shouldn rarely betrayed instead shouldn betrayed all since the trust voters the slate electors can betrayed why not put the power the voters hands instead people most the voters have never even met the voters aren even voting for the president the electoral college system they are voting for slate electors and the text written plumer that the voters can even control who they voting for another claim plumer article back the last sentence the house selection can hardly expected reflect the will the people that just ludicrous also voters quite frequently get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidates that just goes show one the extreme amount problems that the electoral college system has stated plumer passage one the biggest problems the electoral college system has that over percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now but one can expect them listen because you can clearly tell from their system that they don care about the common voters opinion but the direct election system does plumer article loosely states that another thing that can wrong with the system have now the state can possibly cheat and send two slates electors congress has happened before who says can happen again perhaps most worrying the prospect tie the electoral vote john plumer having tie just another terrible flaw the awful electoral college system that the united states runs today most voters can even have say the election don stop running the electoral college system but the finally martens and changes the presidential election would have much fewer problems and would put more power the hands the people like democracy should,5
luke bomberger was man who worked for seagoing company thats person who goes over seas during world war help people and there towns and citys was program called seagoing cowboys the story are reasons join the program here are some you can travel the world and places that you have never been you will travel the oceans like the altantic and pacific while you this job you like animals this would good job for you because luke had check the animals every hour could sign for that part luke claim was that being seagoing cowboy was much more than job know this because the passage says that seagoing was much more than adventure opened the world him all luke bomberger was man who thought that that seagoing was lifetime opportunity and loved,2
the face mars not created aliens this natural landform earth there already were landforms that were created can say aliens made those too such volcanoes rivers and mountains also couldn say built those because didn aliens really did build the face mars how come their isn any proof anything was the planet there was any form living species you would have least seen egyptian style pyramids even small shacks mars planet that know for having rocks there possibility that this just huge rock that was carved into the planet already the planet self got either hit and asteroid had been forming self some way aliens could have build the face they would needed solem short ungrounded passenger even shelter none these things were found when discovered the face get the picture looks blurry btu even with zooming you can see any such thing there was alien scientist has studied the photos the astronauts had brought home saw their were may rocks this could have been mistake how would alien know what human face looks like anyways our understand could looking and imaging face when really just rock that was formed look like humans head april when mars global surveyor flew oven the face snapped pictures ten times sharper then the original viking photos thousands people anxious have the photo appear jpl web site yet still came out with saying that was just natural landform people were not satisfied this bring back the point were was just our imagination maybe looking wrong really meant look like one thing but were making look like another belive that aliens really did make this face how come their wasn any type form which can tell their was any type life form living mars landscapes are usual see plainest and this was one them there was any type life form think michale malin would have already taken pictures them had seen anything didn which means this face was actually natural landform,4
sir can interest you with this flyer about the seagoing cowboys program fine but thank you said the man but sir you don even know what the progam about well then tell replied the man great and exisiting adventure were you boat acrostic the atlantic the pacific and help the countrys ruin bringing animals and food for the animals well but don you think that could more just donating money asked the man when you donate money gets spit and small percentage the money goes each individual contry need however with this program you can help country very effectively bringing hundreds animals overseas time but that sounds like much more work than just donating money you join the seagoing cowboys you will get see many exisiting things and you will helping more than you could you just donated money well have alot spare time hands since got fired from job and nothing else said the man well then you can join the program and help the countrys need you know what will take flyer guarente you will not disappointed thank you said the man,1
you ever dream about sitting back and relaxing your way work many people have with the new technology that being improved upon each and every day that might just become reality tesla projected release for car that can drive autopilot for the time don want this new technology part life think too dangerous concept just give try cars have been driven humans for over years that how believe should stay there are few states that believe too they have laws that prevent testing computer driven cars there think they should continue develop the technology and get spot perfect before accept there are also lawsuit concerns there accident who you blame the one the vehicle the people that made the car that little bit confusing isn many people believe this whole driverless car technology but say just leave cars alone and continue let humans drive them avoid all the confusion with little more investigation into the topic and little more research believe this could become smoother process for the manufactures but for now leave the cars,3
the arguement over the driverless car safe not can tested all around these scientists are wanting more futuristic automobiles try and make more effient ways for travel although really that safe personal opinion think not have the technology yet these cars are not ready for the roads anyone with the unsafe technology them don think these cars are good safe idea for this time the cars are proven not fully drivable unless specific roads created for what happens someone injured because the cars technology fails the company would responsable for this and most likely into lawsuit just unsafe for the company people and surroundings for these cars the road the whole aspect self driving car amazing but creators shouldn try put these automobiles the street until proven perfect isn one knows what kind things can happen there could injures tragic events and all because these companies are putting unsafe technology into the hands normal citizens that don know anything about the possibility these things happening therefore see unsafe for these cars the road around other citizens that can injured from technology that isn fully developed all and all these driverless cars should not sold used for the public until they are sure they will not have any technology fails that why think they need wait and mature every aspect and detail about this idea,3
the facial acting coding system that being used read emotional expressions students classroom valuable because can tell exactly how somone feeling rather they are sad happy just their facial expressions the text its states that the whole process begins when the computer constructs computer mode face all major muscles the mode move like humans muscles also staes that six basic emotions was classified happiness suprised anger disgust fear and sadness associate with each characteristic movement the facial muscles during the process your frontalis pars laterals muscles above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you are suprised and the orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips show that you are anger the text also states that even though some people often show varying degrees expression like smiling broadly using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks the facial movements real face painted face they this weighting the different units also the software can identify mixed emotions hard trying describe each facial trait that conveys happy mad huang observed that artists like vidic studies human anatomy help them pliant facial muscles enough convey specific emotions his software stores anatomical information like electronic code the technology can always recognize when student bored confused also can make computers animated faces more expressive for video games video surgery the technology can also indicate the differents between genuine smile and forced smile its just all about those muscular action units think this technology read the emotional expressions students your classroom really valuable because dont know have any technology that can read every emotion that you are feeling and that others around you are feeling,2
you may have heard the new driverless cars you may heard all the cool technology has and how you will the coolest you have but even you will the coolest will you the safest that the real question you should asking yourself personal opinion these high tech driverless cars that should not the next big thing the world say that these cars are doubt cool but still would not buy one and put life risk keep saying how these cars are not safe and believe that because you never know when the car will just start messing and put you and everyone around you danger all technology messes and has glitches every now and then who say these cars won even though the company says the driver still will not able text and call know for fact people will people will think that the car has everything under control when that truly not the case and they will stop paying attention their surroundings need cars that people have take control and pay attention they will stay aware and off their phones also you fall asleep the wheel says that the seat will vibrate but you are heavy sleeper you were just extremely tired who say that vibration will wake you time before crashing also believe people would get extremely bored just sitting there and having the car all the work for them pretty much even though says you have keep your hands the wheel you are still not steering you are just holding the wheel let the car know you are still the car and paying attention these companies are saying that safety their main concern but just don believe that the case sadly never knowing when the car may mess just down right scary just strongly believe these cars should not the roads believe they should just stay car shows and looked but never driven another thing paragraph states that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver totally agree with them important that alert person behind the wheel controlling automobile these traffic laws make illegal some states test self driven cars conclusion just strongly believe should just stick driving the cars ourself include technology much our daily lives already really necessary have cars that can control themselves not not all the reasons listed above are really could questions you and the people who make these cars ask themselves,4
say that the image the moon just natural land from because the image located degrees north maritain attitude where was winter other reason belive this becuase the passage states not easy target cydonia facts its hard work last reason the last paragraph stating that looks like lava dome that takes form isolated mesa about the same height the face the moon let explain reasons for belies first reason paragraph states the fac mars located degress north cydonia attitude where was winter meaning was winter winter theres very massiveness objects are going fly around out space object hit mars when the winds were blowing didnt forget about the passage saying that the image resembles husam mean this soutter space winds are very massive out there more thaton likely winds just blew much dust off the area that those figures appeared second reason falls paragraph stating that its not easy target cydonia facts its hard this telling that cydonia hard reach meaning hard get out there that follows point because cant human face its its hard reach human dont have the specialised equipment how could the possibly find there way make out there even they did you would see facel features they would have have hemis order breath out there also aliens are not identical dont thing the shape would round resembling human third and final reason that paragraph states that looks like lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face the moo picked this reason because this more reasonably that the alien cantero its already stating that its about the same size the face the moon with all the winds that were happening this could possibly right its makes mor science than the other topics because adds thats why say natural land form the winds its hard work get out there and that lava dome takes the place the shape that was the moon with reasons just gave its makes science and sounds way more believable that the aliens topic because dont even know aliens are real not with reasons you too should think its natural land fpm,4
facial action coding system sounds like something that would invented created the far future there real such thing facial action coding system seems that there aren many negatives why shouldn used classroom setting today the facial action coding system should used the classroom setting because will show students understatement interest level and overall thoughts over topic subject also another plus could show students themselves something they may interested which they didn know even themselves imagine class where there facial action coding system computer for each student use there would many benefits using something like this sounds perfect for classroom setting first all would show teachers the understatement level students certain topic subject there subject topic which kids faces were scanned for their feelings about that subject the teacher could maybe improve make the lesson easier for students which overall would create better education system for the students the class and better opportunity the second reason why would valuable have the facial action coding system int classroom would because would show students and teachers levels interest kids may have certain subject topic for example say there are kids class and they begin there science notes studies etc and some kids have more higher interest feelings than others the topic that can show both teachers and even students what they truly feel about science and can lead helping kids making bigger decisions their lives such whether not they want pursue career with lots science involved not the third reason use facial action coding system would because universal from the article making mona lisa smile said that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal the facial expressions for each emotion being universal means that anyone from anywhere around the world can use this tool help them succeed school matter what ethnicity they are from and they look different also this facial action coding system universal imagine how accurate definately would valuable classroom seatings all around the world and would creat greater opportunites for students get better education conclude the facial action coding system would valuable classroom setting because shows understatement shows interest and universal which could also mean extremely accurate and enhanced the facial action coding system has many benefits which would great help teachers classroom well the facial action coding system could used tool succeed many around the world and overall the facial action coding system great and would extremely valuable classroom settings,4
believe that driverless cars are and are going great piece technology development driverless cars could give life changing future driverless cars may sound questionable some people but believe they could safer than our vehicles today google bmw mercedes benz audi and nissan have been working creating safe driverless vehicles for the last years how far they have come just this short amount time amazed many people how far they are still planning come will blow some people away sensors alone have come long way just the past years they are built detect danger and respond danger possible accidents what the sensors can detect far better than the response and control human driver parag the car not totally driverless find this plus for driverless cars because technology not always reliable humans need assist with some the things that technology can reliable for just bmw announced the traffic jam assistant then could drive mph only going mph the car requires the driver hold onto the wheel all the vehicles are designed warn notify the driver when needs humans skills companies are coming with many ways inform the human that assistance needed google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since their cars have driven more than half million miles without crash parag human drivers today have crashes daily matter what everytime someone gets car they are putting their life danger believe that with the new technolgy advances driverless cars the number car crashes would decrease tremendously overall believe that the advances for driverless vehicles have come far their development just short number years think that driverless vehicles will safer and more efficient way driving for our future they will saving lifes daily and saving money the long run,3
think that from luke point view looks like great experience and would opportunity lifetime seagoing cowboy being seagoing cowboy you get travel and see many amazing places and meet many types people also you like animals you are luck because you get take care them while your the boat sailing across the sea another thing you might get have your birthday some awesome like luke did greece the following paragraph going telling you some things about being seagoing cowboy like what like take care the cattle some amazing places that you might visit and how you must careful while board the ship being seagoing cowboy you get many things and experience them one huge thing that you would have willing take care all the animals the ship sailing with you like young cows horses and mules like luke the animals the ship would keep you busy you would have feed them and give them water least three times day pull bales hay and bags oats out from lower holds the ship and clean out the stalls also you would get many amazing places around the world like luke did you might get places like europe and china and see acropolis greece and maybe take gondola ride venice and see italy the city with streets water you would also have careful while board the ship one night luke slipped down some stairs and almost went over board and because this cracked couple ribs and had take break off the job would quite adventure seagoing cowboy now that have told you some thrilling things about seagoing cowboy what you think think would much fun sail crossed the world while taking care animals and going all kinds places would exciting but would also make nervous because when luke bomberger was seagoing cowboy almost went over board think that being seagoing cowboy would open the world you and how you thought the world just like did luke bomberger who was amazing seagoing cowboy know that told you what think would like from luke point vew hope that encourage you want being seagoing cowboy,3
mesa mars who what created this face mars was aliens just nature doing its thing the answer has been debated ever since was discovered and the truth has been found although there proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the viking pictures skilled scientist themselves don even think could made aliens and there are similar landforms earth some people still find ways argue these people might say the markings were hidden under the haze but just much that could true could also wrong this face was created none other than mother nature herself start the pictures taken and were much clearer than the original viking pictures and unmask the face for what really unmasking the face mars states michael malin and his mars orbiter camera moc team snapped picture ten time sharper than the original viking photos illiterate the article saying that this new picture was much better and much more revealing the day this picture was taken april was completely cloudless this means that there couldn have been any alien markings hidden somewhere garvin said rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size hinting that even small things that show there was civilization there could been seen this picture conclude the new picture was proof the world that this was just landform not only did picture tell this was sign alien life mars but did skilled scientists when the picture was first taken scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh all know that scientists know their stuff why doubt them their first instinct was that was just another landform why can all just agree with them and get with our lives worry about something more important even the caption for the picture when was released for everyone see noted that was just huge rock formation why can just see this face for what lastly there are landforms earth just like they called mesas buttes garvin says that reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars these landforms can naturally occur earth can they also occur mars garvin sees that this landform just like something have our own home some people might say that when the picture was taken the face that was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered the clouds they must have done lot research because normally april cloudy time the red planet but that day was completely clear and sunny these people might just the kind who believe the supernatural and say that they been abducted aliens there much more proof this face being natural landform compared being alien made landmark where one side would say that scientists don believe there chance this the other side would say was cloudy the day that picture was taken overall there excuse for the fact that this naturally occuring all all this face natural landform that has nothing with extra terrestrial life mars there proof behind like the picture taken the fact that actual scientists don think there any chance being alien related and there are landforms like this one earth called butte mesa all these things poove that not only was the face mars just natural forming landform will you know the real cause something like the face mars next time you see one,5
think the author supports the idea well because would think would dangerous going see venus but that just what read this passage some evidence that saw this passage how venus would dangerous that venus covered carbon dioxide and melt submarine that goes our deepest oceans also every other spacecraft that landed venus only survived couple hours conclusion that much humans try get and personal with venus will never happend because how dangerous explanation the evidence that venus risky for astronauts study really the only say this that venues surface the hottest out all the planets venues surface temperature averages degress fahrenheit alson the atmospheric pressure times greater than what are used here earth,2
almost everywhere where there human population there major usage cars cars and other vehicles are used one day day basis and are one the reason most people have jobs but what cars could get better cheaper and usable for all including the disabled this the the future cars the driverless car the modern world people that are poor tend stuggle get job one the reason this happens because they don have way getting work time sure buses and subways are the best public way travel but they tend take while arrive your stop not mention the crowd the people who also need the transport whith driverless cars there way people with small income can places with wait and owning car google cofounder sergey brin says that public transport taxi system could become reality and would use half the amount fuel today taxis use meaning the price for fair would also decrease and easier for the wallet driverless taxis will not only help the poor but also the disabled too people who are bind have other handicaps that would stop them from getting from place place alone could now able move around freely the driverless taxis the cars could also have customer service option anyone needs help they can have person help them since the cars would have modèle the surroundings using lidar the passenger wouldn have worry about driving being danger this would also improve the life the police and other rescue agencies that need speed through traffic stopping all cars the area slowing them down the whole city would safer since most people would using the driverless cars instead regular ones the future the people will safer spend less money and live better driverless become reality far though all attemps are not successful since driver still needed things the car can like navigating through work sites accidents but with given time and research the idea the driverless car will become great improvement the lives many people,4
losing privilege drive car risk some people use cars for there main transportation some places you will found countries and nations that dont limits you drive car anymore those places are germany paris and bogota columbia these cities limit the right driving car but the citizens agree many different ways vauban germany the citizens are happy that most people dont have cars the citizens think its great idea cars are the street they have certain places that you can park you own car there only two places you can park and those two places are the large garages the edge the development and you have buy space for along with new home there percent vauban families not own cars and percent sold car move there they think that cars wouldbe been much for them and that since the cars has been gone has had big impact the german society tahta has lower the transportation bills percent down the law paris the cars have been moved off the street due smog the smog happened when the pollution started there was almost drivers fined for refusing follow the orders paris has also created new tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline the diesel makes percent vehicles france compared percent average diesel engines the rest western europe according reuters paris averages more smog than any other european capitals last week paris had micrograms particulate matter per cubic meter compare with brussels and london reuters found the paris people have come conclusion that its cars and diesel has effected its community and such more but its the main resin why paris has the advantages limiting car usage the people bogota columbia its new program that sets spread other countries after the program started colombians have begin hiking bike riding and skating reduce the traffic jams its the third straight year cars have been banned with just taking bus and only taxis for day the capital million people the goal try and promote alternative transportation and reduce the smog pollution the violators will have face fines good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution said businessman carlos arturo plaza rode two seat bicycle with his wife for the first time two other colombian cities cali and valledupar have joined the event the municipal authorities from other countries came bogota and joined the event day without cars part improvement campaign that began bogota the mid parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city since the even president barack obama has accepted the terms the car limits and thinks its good idea the citizens,3

twenty five years there had appeared something strange mars some scientist tought was some type alien face had eyes and nose they started thinking there could aliens mars but personally think just landform cause many things after while had shot ten times sharper picture than the orginal one revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all but the other scientist still was satisfied for what belived but was telling him that there were some type face alien could have seen the picture had token just could see there were objects like triplanes the ground even small shacks you could see what they were what the picture actually shows was equivalent butte messa landforms common around there for this strange thing mars nothing but landform,2
dear senate think that should actually keep the electoral college there are many reasons why should keep for one that that electors choose the president and the vice president and the counting the electoral votes congress another reason should keep the electoral college because has electors also helps the giving president those are some reasons why the people should keep the electoral college first all the reason why the people should keep the electoral college because the electors choose the president and the vice president and the counting the electoral votes congress the reason say this because the people need president and the electoral college helps get one the electoral college helps get vice president well because the president dies some sort the vice president can take the electoral college also helps count the electoral votes the congress those are some ways the electoral college helps further more another reason why the electoral college helps the and the that have electors the reason say this because every elector there job picking the president that will run for the also helps pick out the vice president well like said first paragraph that why should keep the electoral college the electors help pick out the president that need for everyone lastly the last reason think should keep the electoral college because helps giving president that need president can much for like barack obama did great things keep this nation secure for the people other great president did the same thing back then because the electors from the electoral college those electors helped pick president can have one and that why need the electoral college conclusion today talked about why the people need electoral college and there are many reasons for sum all the reasons need electoral college becasue the electors helps picking president vice president and the electoral votes that need another because have electors that help pick president last that they give the president this are some the reasons why the people need electoral college,3
the article driverless cars are coming google and bmw are working build driverless cars one will need buy cars anymore two thousand nine google had transformed their toyota prius that was computerized and had sensors bmw later created car that could drive self through traffic jams were asked was with aginst the development totally driverless cars think having driverless cars because feel that the accident rate will the text says they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents this means the human driver has remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires the bad thing about this what happens when the sensor stops working tell you that you need take over jorhat happens your cars computer brakes stop working and you run into the bucak someone also the text says some manufactures hope that bringing car entertainment and information systems that use heads display sure car entertainment systems sound nice but wouldnt that considered distraction having entertainment system the car would cause distraction the road ahead therefore when the car longer capable driverless driving you wouldnt payin attention the road before you thus causing accident the text also states the technology fails and someone injured who faut the driver the manufacturer agree who would fault there are accidents caused driverless vehicles how would you rule out who did the person inside not controling the car you would have blame the manufactory because that person was the one that assembled the car but how that fair wasn even there witness the accident the end driverless cars should not further developed because they would not safe and potentially put danger driverless cars still require the human aware the road ahead case the car can not handle the road conditions also installing car entertainment systems would cause distraction especially you have aware the road lastly who would fault when comes someone getting accident driverless cars should not furter developed due safety precautions,4
for driverless cars they can have plus side and downside see that driverless cars can good thing for few reasons the positive affects the driverless car could range between keeping accidentes from distractions down and for long trip safety they can also have downside these downsides very from people who like driver malfunctions the car there are some positives the driverless car one these reasons would for the drivers that get distracted easily the drivers wont have worry about not being able stay focused since they will not have drive the driverless car can also keep drunk drivers from driving preventing big amount crashes there are also many more reasons driverless car can good thing even with all the positives the driverless car will have some negative effects and problems there will always drivers who would prefer drive and feel safer that way some cases they could right for instance what the computer the car has malfunction what would happen then what the car will not switch manual drive these are some the more important questions that would need tested and thought about driver want feel safe but can the put their faith computer driverless cars can have their plus sides safety though with the positives there will always the negatives and the questions will the driverless car function right will there mistakes believe that matter how much they try there will always problem with but the driverless car can safe way transportation,2
although the idea driverless cars sounds fantastic seems little too good true have faith the engineers who will designing the cars but have less faith the people who will these self driving cars stated the article the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over that sounds easy enough but what the driver fell asleep what the driver had some kind medical emergency and they fainted what the driver paying too much attention their phone notice that there obstacle accident ahead what these are questions don want answer from first hand experience not trust other people responsible and ready take action when the time comes for them drive perhaps case emergency the same time not want put life the hands machine something could always malfunction when think about future generations and how they might not have learn how drive get little sentimental ever since cars have been around its been major milestone young peron life get their drivers license its right passage becoming adult getting your driver license signals that you independent self driving cars really become thing the future getting license might not necessary and young adults will longer have this important right passage driving car skill take nascar driving for example its sport based skillful driving driving car develops hand eye coordination quick reflexes and problem solving abilities drivers make self driving cars their main mode transportation they will longer developing these skills through driving driving your own car puts your life and others lives your hands and forces you think responsibilty drivers will become careless and nonchalant about driving they have driverless cars who say that driverless cars are going revolutionary fatal the bottom line that putting life into the hands the car and only have one life why would risk,3

against driverless cars the future will need our own cars not neccessary have that types cars transportations car like those kind everybody needs their own tranportation work store hospital etc for some reason would good idea because would save fuel because they will only used half the fuel today taxis and offer more far flexibility but instead why don they they same cars now days people used and the driverless cars would the same only thing that would different that everybody would have one would much easier and wouldn public they would have ride with other people all squish together because full driverless cars can dangerous how well could cause accidents can lose control anything can happen because their are that reliable plus google cars aren truly driverless they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues opinion don want for the future have public cars like those,2
transportation will only advance throughout time today city has advanced from horse and buggy steam powered engines trains powered magnetic field cars have advanced from gasoline powered engine engine that can charged from outlet the next thing make transportation easier for the public making unnecessary for them much work the way achieve this mass produce driverless cars driverless cars are very efficent they don cause the driver have waste time doing the work now the drivers can make phone calls eat lunch safer than ever driverless cars will still require the driver aware its surroundings and alert for problem occur this causes maximum amounts safety for the driver and others the road the car designed notify the driver there are any difficulties today society already halfway driverless cars why not take that extra step couldn harm besides many lawsuits but those could prevented making laws for these cars before they made for the public driverless cars could very beneficial society could cause many improvements for other things technologically advance too the work and studies are continuously being made for driverless cars all transportation could just high tech driverless cars only they are released the public,3

there has always been argument about the face mars since was discovered many people believe natural and others think someone made put there mask that looks perfectly task can landform many people say since the face has been magazines books and even shows considered something everyone has opinion about there has been many pictures and photographs taken the face came out clear mask untouched some would describe how looked scientists and other specialists have studied and researched time has passed some people say looks like belongs with the egyptian culture spacecrafts rockets and monitors have supervised the face ever since was found debatable would say whether landform natural the argument quite fascinating many ways books have been written about talk shows televison have talked about and people have came with evidence and facts for what they believe the face mars you are person like you would believe the face landform could easily tell and prove indeed landform too close the sun you would instantly die when people found out about armstrong trip the moon they were excited but can anyone mars course not way hot the distance from earth mars wide spread going the moon one thing but going mars another thinking and dreaming about going mars all nice until you realize not possible everyone knows you can into outer space and the moon but everyone also knows you can possibly mars and come back alive plus get there and back would tough fuel doesn last long you think does just ask the apollo crew about that you have prepared and knowing the possibilities what could wrong also takes lot money the moon think about how much would mars nobody could have put that face mars people would think you were insane you told them that the face ordinary there nothing else like even close everyone has their own beliefs and stories what they think happened there has been many people who studied thinus face definitely debate hopefully one day will find the truth maybe will breaking news like did when they very first found the face,2
yes many people think that the face mars was monument created aliens possibly creating sign some sort however this not true what you think the face actually natural landform this natural landform may appear look like face but why the landform looks like face becuase the shadows that hit the landform certain areas this had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh makes look somewhat like face huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth another reason why the landform looks like face becuase our eyes that play tricks may make seem real that face such illusion that make appear that the landform looks like face that staring the camera mars many poeple however will still ask for more evidence that the landform not alien artifact mars orbiter camera moc team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original photos when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was monument all what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars the landforms that you are seeing are actually common along the american west they don just pop out nowhere they have been seen before not like first thing that scientists are just discovering this evidence proves that there alien monument mars may appear look like but scientists have proved that only natural landform created naturally mars not alien monument that was created sign aliens mars,3

dear senator the presidential election one the most important events that goes the united states the core this election the electoral college the only problem the college has many flaws like source states that our founding fathers established the electoral college compromise between the election the president vote congress and election popular vote from the citizens who qualify you know the consists the selection electors meeting electors where they vote for the president and vice and the counting the votes congress there are electors votes and takes majority votes win the election this flawed system has been around too long and needs altered favor getting rid the and going winner popular vote the presidential candidate favored more than the country then she should win like source history shows that the past candidates have clearly won the popular vote but sill lost the presidency race the problem with the current system have place that the people who are supposed have direct voice the government not instead the people vote for other people who they are supposed trust vote favor their opinion can see how some people believe this system trust however some history has shown otherwise history has shown that electors can against the opinion the public when you vote for electors most the time they turn vote for what the people want the only thing you are not ensured that this will occur the end the elector who can decide however they wish personally for the would more effective winner popular vote not only because the sureness the electors but also because that what the people want another valid arguement get rid the whole electoral college process source states that sometimes voters get confused with the electors and vote for the wrong candidate that could detrimental the country the wrong person for the job was elected was the popular vote sytem the selection candidates would clear and easy understand which leads less mistakes when voting the view getting rid the electoral college actually quite popular source tells richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce and others have all agreed that should abolish the electoral college going all the way back the beginning our country started off the base principle that the people must have direct voice the government that the reason our country was made democracy the electoral college has bent those principles and hasn fully allowed the voice the people heard with the popular vote put place their are middle men just the people voicing what they want and who they want represent them looking over the information that has been presented clear that the electoral college has the system flawed for many reasons such the popular candidate not winning voices not being ensured that they will heard and the confusing system not voting directly for your president the change winner popular vote the election made none the previous flaws will present the popular vote sytem will ensure the people get what they want and the process completely fair for these reasons our society best interest that our government makes this change abolish the electoral college and bring new age simple and fair elections from concerned citizen,4
believe students should able use the new technology called the facial action coding system could help improve student interest the subject the technology could also enforce students want get better grades using the facial action coding system could benefit the classroom and students the software could help improve student interest because could modify the lesson like actual teacher the system would detect that you were bored and most likely make entertaining valuable because the coding helps teachers understand how change their teaching format the text states class room computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor huang could also help students want get better grades they notice that the software changing the students benefit then maybe they will start enjoying the class more and take more seriously with the facial action coding system could see downfall the new technology valuable for students class home helps them understand what going class there also more personal experience with the software compared basic lessons the facial action coding system makes there teacher front you when you are home the future this technology will probably make classrooms and students more advanced,3
believe that the face just natural landform because they even had pictures that proved that was natural landform many people the world had their own personal claims about the face but scientifically had been proven pictures otherwise mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time and captured pictures the face with ten times better camera than the original viking photos that were taken before the article the text says thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all even cameras caught the landform with pictures and proved the text also states what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin according this piece informational text from the article the face massive natural landform just like any landform here earth this article has been proven nasa and detailed pictures the facere that just natural landform that just happened look like human face even though some had their own thoughts and opinions scientifically they were wrong,3
when the inventions mass production for cars started doubt that the makers ever thought car that could drive itself this new technological age though the sky the limit and companies are racing make the holy grail cars one that does not even require driver there are arguments for driverless cars saying that will decrease human error however there are also those who are against the movement driverless cars how you start trust automobile safely drive your family around itself there can always faults manufacturing and giving cars one hundred percent control something that many may uneasy about the idea that there may point time when one owns cars forging however flexible taxi system maybe would still like know that car mine and not shared with thousand other people the difficulties perfectly matching the supply and demand for people who need the cars may next impossible this point time the prototypes for these driverless cars are not driverless the car itself able navigate situations itself however there are times traffic work zones when the human driver has notified and take the wheel problem that this means the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires what would happen the driver had fallen asleep the car equiped pull itself over untill the driver wakes there would alo have new laws and regulations put place protect drivers and the manufactures the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer you not want have car companies putting out bad products and having the public rely them one hundred precent the work you also would not want those companies taking the blame for every avoidable fender bender where the line liability the flip side the coin may the good that these new cars could for society and the environment using only half for the gas would incredible gas prices would decrease because the supply and demand there would less pollution the air and over all would better environment having the ability sit back with your family and watch movie while driving from mississippi new york amazing the price airfare may also down because there would comfortable choice that both cheaper and less hassle this may also help people with disabilities more independent there are already cars out there for them that are altered but sure vast majority could still gain lot from driverless cars myself can not wait for the day when can tell car where then take nap the realities however are that may not happen for the next forty years get point when every car out there driverless will take time passing laws rebuilding roads passing test and just sealing the cars will take more time then would want the idea not owning own car however something that not look forward the thought sitting what the same public seat for hours day crazy could also easy way pass illnesses still look forward own own private driverless car,4
driverless cars would have never crossed our mind years ago but today they are already being developed and tested driverless cars are wrong beacuse they could cause lot more accidents from technology malfunctions they could potentially cause many law suits and problems our world and they will make humans even more technology dependent and incapable taking care themselves somehow lost all electricity and had operate cars ourselves driverless cars are owned and operated the company who makes them humans have little control what happens the car the car crashes would the manufacturers fault the humans fault driverless cars could potentially cause many unneccessary arguments and law suits between manufacturers and consumers someone riding the driverless car and the car crashes the manufacturers should the ones blame unless they develop technology enable the humans take complete control neccessary many arguments could made that the manufacturer didn program the car correctly anf that why the person was injured even much killed this could result manufacturers big companies paying millions maybe even billions dollars law suits driverless cars could cause lot more accidents because there isn someone physically watching the surroundings the car and technology simple calculators can malfunction sometimes would you really trust car run computer with your life driverless cars have human physically driving unless enables the human drive and even then will hard avoid the accident because the car wouldn inform the human about the incident uncles just milliseconds before happens because they can predict the future and neither can the amount accidents would most likely skyrocket driverless cars became everyday thing because the lack control and responsibilty human has the car today have many different things that involve technology have phones that depend for almost everything life have computers which use store information have calculators don even have remember how simple math our own almost everything life has some sort technology make our lives easier now might not even have drive our own car driverless cars could mean that people never have learn how drive and then what would happen for some reason the world lost all electricity wifi and communication signals that means more phones computers calculators and driverless cars people are dependent technology today that giving them another thing dependent not have drive themselves going cause lot problems the world has extreme crisis hardly anyone would know how drive which means very little transportation and will carder communicate with people driverless cars should illegal because could potentially cause ven more unheeded law suits and arguments could cause lot more deaths car accidents and would make people very uneducated how get places the technology somehow stopped working the world just fine driving themselves and top everything else depend technology for would nice keep least one thing have for ourselves just for the sake human independency create driverless cars will truly not have anything left for ourselves and there will extreme crisis something were happen our electricity,5

driverless cars would great but all reality how safe are they are they going expensive should trust these cars with our lives there are lot questions that could asked about these cars but can they all proven well people will soon come find out how safe are these cars they are safe until they have technology mishap failure you can not always trust technology any question these cars could asked but what they can proven for instance your car doesn warn you danger road construction any detours and you asleep but your car didn warn you how that your fault that the thing they will tell you that you were driving was your fault these cars may not safe they may not even cheap think driverless cars are good idea think they are terrible idea sure many people would agree there are enough accidents there but car going fail there another and may not your fault but you were the one driving,2
against because maybe people may going through some things and are just depressed sad but dont want anyone know their personal business also feel like violation privacy everyone has bad moods and good moods and some days are not good the others but feel like would worse with people saying things like hes sad and then questioning that person which can make the situation worse because maybe they may not want talk about also someone else telling you your emotion how you feel may make you think you must feel that way for instance they tell you your emotions but thats not right you may try and correct yourself fit the computers recognition which not right because dont think fair that computer should able tell you say how you are feeling and what your emotions are that would start conflict and attitude which will cause even more worse distracting emotions,2
the use the facial action coding system should become part the technology used classrooms this technology would not only scientific break through but would also provide alternative how efficiently students learn although the creation the facial action coding system was recent the idea the technology has been around for centuries thomas huang creator the software claimed that much more simplified versions the software have been used for for long time the professor claimed that artists such leonardo vinci studied anatomy able make anthropomorphic figures naturalistic possible the artist would use their knowledge anatomy create naturalised facial muscles which would accurately reflect emotions the subjects but this technology could help not only the artistic community but entire generations huang strengthens his argument for the emotion reading software claiming its beneficial usage the classroom huang said classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor the professor predicting that with the help his software the way children learn could changed for the better with the help this software students would able focus topics longer whic poses problem for many students today students would able learn strenghten skills without having voice their boredom confusion with topics this would benefit them they grow because they would able fully understand topics and skills steading falling behind simply becasue they lose interest for example young student would able learn multiplication possibly faster and stronger than older students because with this software they would able focus each problem the child grows they have less likely chance falling behind other mathematical courses because they have need for relearning multiplication and are able solve problems quickly because they know what they are doing also multiplication all over the world they would comfortable use their day day life the end this child was able succeed with mathematical skill simply because facial software that kept them involved and growing their studies overall the facial action coding system should active classrooms because provides great value education,4
the electoral college really good process that think they should keep this electoral college was found the founding fathers and used that the citizens could vote and the congress the citizens get have the right vote who they want president after everyone voted the votes are counted each state and shows which states voted for different people the congress have meeting the electors and get all vote all votes for the congress are counted out seperately then citizens this the start why think electoral college fair and equal all around order for the electoral college elect president they need votes out electors each state country has electors them the candidates running for president have their own electors every years presidential election held the same time tuesday after the first monday novemeber when voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors after voting the election the governor makes certificate ascertainment which the list the candidates who ran for president also shows who the winning candidate each state lastly the certificate sent the states congress keep for records there are mainly reasons why the electoral college should stay first the certainty outcome which shows that there cant dispute because based popular vote the next reason everyone president this means that the presidential candidate has trans regional appeal another reason swing sates which the winner take all method they are usually hatching campaigns and really listen the other candidates those poeple are usually thoughtfully voters the next great reason big states this shows you win big state then you win more electoral votes and each big state has more electoral votes the last reason avoid run off elections this avoids the problem candidates recieve majority the votes the east their are alot great reasonings about electoral college but there are some bad reasonings voters dont vote for the president when they vote they vote for the electors and the electors vote for the president this can mean that even you voted for the specific president your vote shows you voted for the congress people voting for president what there was tie the electoral vote then the election would for the house representives where they vote for president the representative votes are equal million voters this shows that the electoral college can bad for the voters after reading the article and going over believe that the electoral college great idea there are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about not everything can perfect but the electoral college trying get that way the president still getting voted every years and hopefully stays like that for very long time those were all reasons why thought the electoral college the right way,3
the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system for years and years nasa has been trying study venus and despite their pursuits they have failed because the risks that have occured venus should still studied despite the dangers presents because one day when earth becomes overpopulated venus could possibly our only option due how similar the planets are our travels should beyond earth and although dangerous still needs studied years from now earth will become overpopulated and might inhabitable therefore venus could our only option the article says that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel venus should still studied due how similar earth solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans our travels must beyond earth although has been challenging study venus there will always risks that come along with studying new things such the planets our solar system the text states our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiousity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite its proximity there has been numerous spacecraft sent land this cloud draped world although each previous mission was unmanned and spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours does not mean that venus should longer studied any planet will have their own dangers causing there obstacles our path researching potential habitable planet studying venus will come will dangers and risks but our planet got this far because the people never gave pursuing new study even had dangers own venus should still studied because our travels should beyond earth regardless the dangers one day earth won habitable and sister planet will our only option and new studies will come with their dangers they still need studied,4

the use this technology ready the emotional expressions students classroom not valuable why this idea has some pros and cons the case the mona lisa seems lot more reasonable use this type technology because reality just look the painting dont know what her emotions are but since whist new facial action coding system came out lot more usefully her than students classroom now these days students don have lot excitment come school and are often distracted with the other things going around them you have the facial action coding system have them identify their emotions they will pay even less more attention class wether not student isn excited math homework the facs gon na able change the students way feeling towards the homework will the students way feeling about homework change computer system honestly dont think good idea have that kind system classroom opinion the idea having classroom bad idea this system may work other things but not classroom with students this system can also fail student happy but just has serious face the system going what the student looks like not the way she actually feels inside technology now days taking over everything this facs will just make people much lazier because they know that instead asking the way they feel they just want use the system because its much faster and easier instead going the person and actually asking how they feel create less communication with one another the facial action coding system doesn seem useful technology system for students classroom,3
almost everyone owns car because people are traveling constantly get from point point matter who may that person some point their lives needs some way get around everyday people need either the store pick their kids work school you name that doesn mean that owning car necessity all around the world many people are trying cut down and limit their car usage having whole lot other options there are buses people can car pool walk skate bike and many more people are coming the conclusion that whole decide start cutting down our usage cars can benefit the way live lots people actually don mind not having car just yet most teenagers want get their license and car but there much other things they need focus really not priority for them because they have school work plus they need get somewhere they can always take the bus and get ride from friend source germany there city the name vauban that known the most advanced experiment low car suburban life source vauban goal and idea which cut down cars for better living has made way around the world that other states and countries can aspire the same and little little could have world that not dependent cars the idea using cars for some causes them stress and they always tense not using car makes them happier stated heidrun walter media trainer and mother two source the stress aspect this could due the fact that the most recent years the percentage car crashes and accidents have gone many people abhor the idea using cars because they have been terrible accident themselves someone close them also can even just all the traffic jams that occur during rush hour which makes people late and accidents happen for example bogota colombia millions colombians hiked biked skated took buses their designated location leave the streets due traffic jams source since they knew that lots their citizens were deciding not use cars they started making uneven pitted sidewalks into nice smooth replaced ones for them source another reason why people want limit their usage cars because all the pollution cars create passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states source not many people think about the effects air pollution like smog but big deal since people don think about often there way for the majority try and find solution put into action stop help down paris there was partial driving ban clear the air around the city source paris partial ban was their idea try and make their city better place with the ban being enforced and put into play there were about drivers fined source turns out that since the driving ban was made the congestion car traffic had gone down percent the capital france just after five days less smog pollution and paris typically known have more smog than any other european capitals source this goes show that slowly people are actually becoming aware what going and they actually care enought try and make things better all all there are many ways try and cut down our car usage for the better can anything from not buying many cars deciding not use cars all and deciding walk skate and bike etc not only will limiting our car usage whole stop traffic jams car accidents air pollution and more will help benefit our lives for the better whether not people want believe things keep going from here and more and more decide that less car usage better than over time span let say years there could lot less dangerous things occuring our lives,5
many people have there own opinion something and experience feel like venus sounds like good planet live but impossible for humans get there into the sky and into venosus many researchers say okay for humans live mars sometime the future but again would impossible for some get there and would cost lots money some say decide move mars can return earth and would have build our own house mars and make our food survive sounds very challenging for humans explore venosus because many storms they get there and because how hot out there for they get almost the most earthquakes and these quakes cause them get biggers circle holes and thats why when you look picture planet you most see circle holes them and rocky parts them also because the quakes nasa has study and plan solution for sending humans venosus and study and explore venosus will very possible for them because the dangerous temperatures and storms these aren easy conditions live many say when humans return earth from space they are sick depending ehrich planet what they did space get sick and injured this why there should only humans that know what they doing and not humans that don know what they doing and life threatening there self mercury the closet the sun and has dangerous high temperatures that cause life threatening and cause injuring and why earth the second closet the sun and not have dangerous temperatures like mercury and venosus its because climate change our planet good sometimes can get worst not getting enough attention can cause temperatures rise above high temperatures like reaching degrees and higher then usual and some cold parts can get very dangerous wind chills and cold temperatures exploring venosus possible but would take lot work and research see humans are ever allowed ever visit venosus only devices have been sent venosus and researchers are using these devices see all the parts venosus get more information how feel there and safe scientists have discovered that venosus get more quakes volcanoes and stormy weather conditions more than the earth and does,3
dear mrs senator the electoral college process created the founding fathers america choose pesident vote congress and popular vote qualified citizens believe this not very effective process think that should popular vote because allows the citizens have vote and not people that already run our country and allows the president chosen fairly begin with the electoral college not good idea becuase allows citizens have voice and not decided people that already run odour country resorted this method there might higher voter turn out because the citizens will feel that they really have say who runs the country they won think that they vote for one person and they win that some lousy people congress will come and make different decision and against the majority this will make more and more people want make difference the country then will have more concerted citizens and the will better all around country stated source two voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president that fact why should absolutely not have electoral college then don have electoral college then will have higher voter turn out then after that the good ole usa will better country than all the other countries the world combined except for our health and education that just one reason why should not have electoral college additionally should not have electoral college because will then allow chose the president fairly with not having the electoral college vote president would make thehr voting system more fair and not based few people then when people try and figure out they will vote not they will think hey vote does matter becuase there electoral college spoil vote this would make for much better run country becuase the citizens have voice the government the only reason citizen would not vote would they were critically injured they didn like any the candidates this just one the many reasons why should get rid the electoral college conclusion should get rid the electoral college because would give the citizens more voice and would make thehr voting process more fair this would make the government and the country run smoothly and lot better than keep the electoral college thank you for your time mrs senator,4

dear state senator month day year this essay will explaining why the electoral college shouldn kept and why should popular vote instead determine the president the united states opinion should popular vote because citizens know what want the electoral college may know what they want for themselves unit but honestly think that the united states should stick popular vote article read called the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses are wrong bradford plumer states that state legislatures can technically picking electors that will always defy the will the people notice this very unfair because electors are always going defy what say and want why should vote isn one america catch phrases power the people well this case seems power the electoral collage this article also states that many cases faithless electors have occassionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please the electors can choose for whomever they please why can also think that the electoral college unfair because the winner take all system candidates don have spend time states they know they have chance winning while they the states that they know they have absolute chance winning and take those winning votes this case have agree with bob dole abolish the electoral college also think its wrong that voters can always control who their voting for because all the freedom our own opinions and the process the electoral collage they are basically just throwing all opinions the trash they obviously don care and see this completely irrational and unfair know that may use the electoral collage way keep everyone calm but think they were let the people vote they wouldn have worried about not being calm because that getting what want and therefore why are going complain also consider the electoral collage electors high class this case they are going want vote for the benefit them think this unfair the lower income families because the electors choose president that going want take all the benefits away from lower income families how are they going live how are they going survive remember power the people sincerely proper name,4
dear state senator the one word used throughout this whole article catastrophic which whats best used describe the electoral college the united states america born and based off popular sovereignty should just that decided the people the electoral college has only been hindrance since its arrival confusing american citizens left and right becoming issue voters interested future voters and disallowing fair chance voters vote importance their state and their country the electoral college should disbanded and retried popular vote because two main reasons does not allow for simple method voting and does not allow for every vote and voice heard the united states presidency election tarnishing this countrys right democracy causing outrages all over the country initialize this one sided argument lets begin with important factor that the electoral college can not trusted achieving the fact that every vote counts with over million people now the united states under unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy have not been democratic the sense that peoples vote doesnt even their president only another mind that can cast you away you were not important stated par source article the office the federal register most states have winner take all system that awards all electors the winning presidential candidate these are the minds that are sometimes chosen random other factors represent you choice you weren allowed make the winner takes all method only takes away from states like texas and california who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree democratic republican and what currently used our society this damages thousands voices thousands votes that could have matter but seemingly don just like how schools have implemented the child left behind policy should transcribe this leaving american citizen without voice only dependant what state their theories how single vote doesn matter have been given stated par source richard posner voters the presidential elections are people who want express political preference rather than people who think that single vote may decide election who also comes contradict themselves originally with nixon and clinton both had only percent plurality that instance that one vote could made huge difference our future top that many voices states that arent swing states states that could democratic republican and aren fixated only party that have been silenced could add tremendous amount single votes changing this nations history drastically furthermore onto this argument one thing known world wide factor that applies almost everything that simpler better you take your precious time and read all par source what you will gather that extremely over affectionate method used when determining our next president step step instructions selecting choosing voting controling and nevermind the problems has already caused from the confusion all these instructions something that can fixed easily one thing overriding fixing and changing our way popular vote this would furthermore simplify our country way voting attracting more voters and overall satisfying many people some have also stated that this necessary providing more organized form voting key knowledge that must analyzed that just because service organized does not mean its correct referencing par source bradford plumer describes how the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election century the system allows for much worse and that those electors could always defy the will the people par according gallup poll taken shortly after gore thanks the quirks the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency many problems that would not ocurre our way voting were simplified into popular vote summarize and simplify what should done with our voting ways this letter you should remove the electoral college overall and implement the popular voting which our country based off this the most profound way fixing the problems that face the simplicity known our current voting ways and the reestablishment our original and hopefully still true government democracy and popular sovereignty,5

the electoral college process not place the electoral college process consist the selection the selection the electors the meeting the electors wher they vote for president and vice president and the counting the electoral votes congress personally believe that electoral colleges work because would great process where students can work their way become congressman and would also look good your reputation would great process where students can work their way become congressman imagine all the wonderful things you can learn about congress and you can have your own personal experience the electoral college consists electors majority electoral votes requited elect the president your state entitled allotment electors equals the number members the congressional delegation one for each memeber the house representatives plus two for your senators under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president you live taxa fpr instance and wanted vote for john kerry you vote for slate democatic electors pledges kerry would look good your reputation each candidate running for president your state has his her own group electors know your would wat that because that would great and really helpful the presidential election held every four years the tuesday after the first monday november you help choose your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate electors after the presidential election your governor prepares certificate ascertainment listing all the candidates who ran for president your state along with the names their respective electors your state certificates ascertainment are sent the congress and the national archives part the official rectors the presidential election the single best argument against the electoral college what researchers call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people,2
the author explains that should study venus and what the dangers that this may presents and could get past those dangers and yet survive this planet that spacecraft have successful landing venus yet because its conditions that the planet has just its atmosphere paragraph explains all the difficulties trying get spacecraft venus atmosphere made carbon dioxide the planets temperature general over degrees and the clouds are made sulfuric acid paragraph this shows that the dangers and how risky that this might bring land this planet the way that they author puts this article that get past all the dangers that this planet holds that could find some very useful scientific evidence that may come important and get past the dangers the clouds the heat could prove that can overcome those conditions that many planets that may have the future that may study paragraph explains why still want after this planet and discover features that may have astronomers are fascinated venus because may once have been the earth like planet our solar system paragraph this explains why want after this planet and how much want get samples from and think that the author really shows good job what the dangers are than actuality explaining why want after this planet many this can come into good way exploring this planet more since haven actually landed spacecraft the planet yet that paragraph shows prof that nasa still want after this planet and send humans there eventually because the hostile conditions the surface venu that they would allow scientists float above the fray paragraph this shows that still want after the planet and try study what going around the surface venus but would still not able onto the planet and collect samples from the planet that would want that the future think that the author shows more there side more the dangers the planet than just stating out the factor reason why want send humans out that planet and get data from believe that all that the author evenly explains why want after this planet and get data and why shouldn after this planet because the dangers that holds,3

electoral voters citizens the have been voting for their presidents ever since george washington was elected they vote because they want their voices and opinions heard they can provide ways make their lives better but the truth the matter don make the decisions the electoral college does they should change the election popular vote the united states reason being because what the point voting they won listen and they only hand pick few people out the millions others but keeping the college would make easier have votes counted initially the point voting heard and have things your way for once but falling deaf ears then why bother for example the indefensible electoral college writer bradford plumer states that under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for state electors who turn elect the president okay lets say someone wanted vote for the republican and they vote for one the electors who pledge themselves the republican can rely person word what they change their mind and vote for the other how can natural citizens know put their faith into random stanger clearly the voter does not get say the matter furthermore the millions people who vote are reduced small amount people the electoral college consists five hundred thirty eight electors and two hundred seventy needed decide who president the office the federal register states like new york and nebraska only have three six people voting since they are small while the other hand california texas and florida have about thirty sixty and with the civilians living there still not enough honestly wouldn even matter they voted the other hand the smaller amount people the quicker the can get president paragraph defense the electoral college replied that tie possible but highly unlikely the presidential vote may have not been landslide but least wasn tie the small amount made lot easier count the votes and the majority voters still got who they wanted wasn all terrible the electoral college hasn all been bad the electoral college has more cons than has pros citizen voice must heard and that won happen only few people are heard but votes can counted faster there only tiny amount,4

the article states that long time ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today this shows that venus wason probably just like how earth today you couve probably lived there and made whole new life there also the text says the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters this shows how venus just alike earth and that maybe should consider exploring venus more the idea the article that they came with that they wanted imagine vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth this showing that humans can possibly live venus its not eady conditions live but they can they should explore venus some more and come with idea people can possibly start life there this would benefit lot people because what something really bad happened earth then people could stay another planet and can have venus back plan anything goes wrong conclusion nasa should consider exploring venus because its would benefit lot people having another planet live would possibly lower the population earth and would make easier for everyone can also backup planet incae anything happened the planet earth and lastly can see how live different survive different planet,3
using this new form technology called the facial action coding system which being used identify human emotions could good contribution society but opinion technology that used read our emotional expressions would not that valuable because there are not lot things could use for and are capable expressing ans sensing our feelings our own were going start using this technology what exactly would use for there are not many actual reasons that would need the article they bring how this technology could used tell politician celebrity was lying telling the truth which could important because would not want supporting someone who lies everyone get them their side about something other than that this technolgy does not actually hold lot value also not think that need technology help tell how feel are all capable knowing how feel something makes happy then will smile and something made sad then might cry having something tell how feel kind waste time and money which could used more important things that need society conclusion this new technology called the facial action coding system used identify our human emotion does not hold any value may have good contribution some people who are not able sense express their feelings but not think important enough used daily basis for certain people,3

the passage driverless cars are coming there are many faults but postive details well against the driverless cars idea because feel like has many fault not really driverless car and not perfected enough against driverless cars because its programming has many faults the passage they say that the sensor weren there the computers weren there and the mapping wasnt there that shows that the cars still need lot work becoming driverless persa not only did they have technology issues has cost issues the prompt paragraph states that radar was device hilltop that cost million dollars wasnt something you could buy radio shack the technology that you would need not cost effective ready hit the streets until they get some the kinks out second reason for being against driverless cars because the car really not driver less the passage says fact none the cars developed are completely driverless the cars need actual humans assist the car because the car not programed for traffic road blocks even the passage says this means the human driver must remain alert and able take over when situation require you can not simply take nap and the car will get you where you need you have say awake and pay attention incae rerouting thirdly strong against the driverless car because its not perfected enough the car doesnt abide the united states laws more then one state the passage states the most states even test computer driven car illegal california nevada florida and even district columbia have led the country allowing limited use semi autonomous cars due the fact driving laws the main idea the laws are keep people safe and not accidents and hurting others even they were legal says even traffic laws change new laws will needed orender cover liability the case accident conclusion driverless cars has many faults not really driverless car and isn perfected enought put the rode the technology fails and somone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer could you live with creating something and somone dies your fault its you you have decide,4
ever wondered why humans can not travel venus well this essay will explain why venus too dangerous for humans travel even though venus like sister earth dangerous travel space ship has touched venus nearly more than three decades venus challenging planet for humans study wonder why venus more dangerous travel rather than mercury even though mercury closer the sun dangerous travel venus because the temperatures are way different than what earth venus has thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets more challenging part are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience earth these type conditions are far more extreme than what humans encounter earth the conditions venus are far too dangerous would like earth where you try drive submarine into the deepest part the ocean could liquefy the metal that the submarine made out venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet even though mercury closer the sun venus still the hottest planet venus even looks hot since looks similar the sun beyond high pressure and heat venus also includes erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes who would want venus after hearing about all the dangerous things that venus encounters astronomers are fascinated venus because the most earth like planet the solar system even though venus vey hot resembles earth the article states venus includes rocky sedimentation also includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters venus has few earth like features after hearing about what venus has the planet course someone would want see for there self venus just too dangerous land something the planet even too dangerous venus atmosphere one day humans can crete something that can take any pressure and will able land any planet even though venus earth sister far too dangerous visit for humans paragraph states our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation human curiosity will lead humans into visiting venus one day,4
dear state senator the electoral college unfair for voters all around the united states the electoral college winner take all system each state the candidates don spend time the states that they know they have chance winning they only focus the tight races the swing states for example during the campaign seventeen states did not see the candidates all voters the twentyfive the largest media markets didn even get see single campaign further more voters vote for not the president but slate electors who turn elect the president voters cant always control who their electors vote for the voters sometimes even get confused about the elector and vote for the wrong candidate you lived texas and wanted vote for bob smith just example you vote for slate thirtyfour democratic electors who are pledged bob smith those electors won the statewide election they would congress and bob would get electoral votes toward his presidency the electors can anyone not holding public office did you know that over voters would prefer direct election more tham the kind election have now according the article gallup poll taken shortly after pre thanks the quirks the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce and the afl cio their time all agreed one thing abolishing the electoral college this years voters can and will expect another close election which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency once again the best argument against the electoral college called the disaster factor americans should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century but the system allows for worse consider that the state legislature are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people segregationists the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors with brand new electors who would against john kennedy some faithless electors have even refused vote for their party candidate and instead they vote for whoever they want its official now the electoral college outdated unfair and irrational the name makes sense also why called the electoral college the electoral college should just abolished like bob dole said who actually voting for the president the people the electoral college,4
believe the use the technology read students emotional expression pretty rusticated but dont think necesssary the article humans can assume other people emotions because have the same emotions everyone else humans know what looks like happy suprised anger disgusted scared and sad because all threw know that there obviously more that only emotions some people feel jealousy and some may feel uncomfortable others may feel paine and some will feel stress that already more emotions that can calculate and computer can another thing that humans can calculate sound can here person crying can detect that they might sad someone yelling can detect that they are mad got hurt they might even excited depending the tone the voice those are couple reasons why think dont relly need the technology reading emotional expressions maybe that just little extra dont think need calculate the way people feel threw computer wouldnt want everyone knowing how feel all moments like privacy want talk about how feel someone that trust then would but know that definitely would not like anyone and everyone being able know emotion whenever thed like just knowing that this could possible gives chills this should not used everyone especially they dont feel comfortable about understand that the machines can modify lessons like effective human instructor can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games even video sergey which pretty amazing agree that the emotion analyzing shoulds used for things like that helps out the way technolgy looks and aslo attracts more people the facial expression for each emotion are universal that something they have said while detecting the mona lisa technology like computer can obviously change the world with people creating and discovering new indias shar with everyone including the world say dont ditch the technology all together but maybe just the parts that can handle our own like detecting emotions other people instead can focus communicating can develope these skills distinguish emotions instead not gaining any knowledge and letting technology all the work for although this idea was fantastic and incredible dont think important for out needs,4
imagine being able detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions new software has been developed that improves accuracy perceiving the emotions others this new software the facial action coding system has promising applications for variety industries you ever get bored school this technology will help keep you concentrated and excited school work the program good idea because will keep kids from zoning out because their bored well needed device because will help students interested school and not wake the morning and say dont want school today humans perform this same impressive calculation every day but teacher can every student once the program will see kids are happy sad angry and bored then will change the lesson adjust your emotions say you were doing lesson the computer and was really boring the program would see that you are bored and adjust the lesson make you interested the lesson this program would help lot students stay interested school some might say invasion our privacy would invade our emotions and some might not like that but this will help your kids stay interested school and want them pursue career that they want because this taught them what they wanted and showed them what excites them,3

this passage there debate human faced rock formation whether natural landform alien artifact many believed alien markings were hidden haze while others believed was natural landform based evidence scientists have alot evidence that the human face rock just landform rule thumb you can discern things digital image three times bigger than the pixel size meaning there was any type alien life form mars then the digital images would show some type evidence instead scientists just keep finding evidence and taking pictures that points everything about the human faced rock back natural landform the face mars gloated degrees north martian latitude where was winter april cloudy time the year the red planet regards that the picture actually shows the maritain equivalent butte mesa trying convince someone believe what scientists say wold bring out alot information about the human faced rock showing just landform telling that person scientists figured was just maritain mesa common around cydonia many say the face bona fide evidence life mars with many saying nasa would rather hide conspiracy theories defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization although few scientists believed the face was alien artifact photographing cydonia became priority for nasa when mars global surveyor arrived the red planet while everyone was waiting for picture the face and was revealed shower alien monument after all mission controllers prepared look again not easy target cydonia saif garvin conclusion all evidence scientists are collecting about this human faced rock all comes out just natural landform,3
dear state senator there big controversy between the issue keeping the electoral college abolishing some people say that should abolish the electoral college because unfair outdated and others agree with the idea having electors choosing their party nominee the electoral college should abolished because unfair for the states with smaller populations and the swing states don get any attention during the presidential election look the statistics about the electoral college see the article what the electoral college the office the federal register states the electoral college consists electors and majority electoral votes your states number electoral votes based off your states population which isn fair smaller states such hawaii alaska hawaii has four electoral votes and alaska has three electoral votes while the larger states like california have fifty five electoral votes the way that our country today decides our winner the presidential election the winner take all system that gives the all the votes the winning canidate the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses are wrong from mother jones brayford plumer states that because the winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states but the article defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president richard posner states that almost all states award electoral votes winner take all basis even slight purity state creates landslide electoral vote victory that state and the winner take all method awarding electoral votes induces the candidates the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational need abolish the electoral college because just isn fair the voters and some stes are getting more attention than other states abolish the electoral college would have more fair election and more people would come and vote,3

driverless cars possible not either from personal transportation public people have been wondering possible belive that with the technology that have today very possible would reduce accidents massively but technology the self driving mechanism would malfunction that car could become hazard the driver and anyone around but still interesting idea think about considering what everyone sees movies many companies are already trying construct working self driving cars for example the first people truely test this theory out was general motors the late while nowadays companies include google bmw tesla mercedes benz audi nissan and are few few issues that they have make fully functioning model are that would too expensive truely make functional especially the manufactures use magnets run set track down every road another issue they have that they can not steer themself around accidents construction but with those issues aside would lot better for the enviroment lowering exhaust about half what today and also would lower accidents all all self steering cars are the future our lifes today although expensive option would worth whether its smart roads smart cars would beneficial how deal with things now they would lower accidents and allow idiots text their phones while driving just look out for the stray dog the roads and you fine,2
limiting car usages good thing because near record pollution found our air when cars are being used also percent congestion went down the capital france because cars diesel fuel was blamed because diesel makes percent cars parks and sports centers will bloom throughout the city pitted sidewalks will replaced broad smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions will drop dramatically and upscale shopping and new restuarant will bruited will start variety new customers and jump start better business recent studies have shown americans that buy fewer cars driving less are getting less licenses the year goes which equals less pollution the our air with these changes people stop the usage car usages and ride bike where they thir will weight drop all ages around the world also this happen kids from ages will less bothered getting license some may still interested wont priority more also the will upscale the growth bikes and bike businesses from all this you will learn that cars pollute are airs therefore stop the usages cars will less traffic more businesses and also more bikes are air will less polluted and their will recent weight loss all ages plus many professional bike businesses wil upscale making bikes and make more over time,2
should valuable classrooms because could help teacher principle even school security could help teicher figure out they turn home work not know the lessen because now most children don want speak for question and teacher would not know they are telling the truth when asking student they know the lessen becasue most students would say yes paragraph six explain how would used computer would recognise when student becoming confused bored then the teacher would give the student assistance could help principle like finding out who did what like when someone gets trouble and then there lots witness and one speaks then they would use the device but not only that would the case could figure out people who bully others and put stop could even help school security the way finding out crimes school like recently there have been school shootings and school security teacher even principle use that technology around every week could probably prevent school shooting before even happens consoler could use help and understand students better like depression,2

the intense debate concerning the validity the electoral college process difficult choose position the electoral college long standing tradition created the founding fathers the early days the united states however the reasons behind the adoption the electoral system are not valid today they were centuries before electoral college was proposed the founding fathers due the fact that the average american citizen the beginning our nation was simple farmer who was not educated enough make informed decision vote nowadays things are different general education the public very advanced and there are various easily assessable forms media from which learn about the policies and positions the presidential candidates after all the president job care for and protect the people america not the politicians therefore shouldn the people not the politicians elect the president even those who support the electoral college must admit confusing system when citizen votes for presidential canidate that vote really goes slate electors who were selected means that vary between states and are pleged that particular canidate and those electors then vote for the president pointed out bradford plumer the indefensible electoral college voters can control who their electors vote for additionally voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate also bradford the indefensible electoral college and bradford makes good point the past faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party canidate there also the fact that candidates for the presidency often focus swing states states whose majority not decided between political parties and whose votes have large impact the election this due the winner take all method the electoral college state that mostly republican democratic presidential canidate may not put much into the local campaing knowing that since most voters are against them they would probably lose the state and gain nothing because all the electoral votes state the canidate who won the majority voters that state thus presidential campaigns are focused the swing states giving little attention the others however the presidential election were decided popular vote campaing efforts would spread evenly across the united states since every voter everywhere counted the final election the method electing president popular vote fair and well balanced one giving the minority parties non swing states say the presidency also was discovered that according gallup poll over pecent voters would prefer direct election bradford plumer the indefensible electoral college was even admitted pro electoral college richard posner his defense the electoral college that tie the national electoral vote possible due the even number total votes posner also states that voter vote swings national election however everyone believed that one would vote all then there could election electoral college method otherwise therefore the individual voter does count and all the minority political parties who electoral slates not get vote for the president due the electoral college popular vote the only reasonable system for electing president who will their best for the american people the people for the people let the all the people vote,5

belief that the author has done good job supporting his claim that should study venus even with the present dangers from the article read have three pieces evidence from the text that will now support claim the first paragraph lines stated that venus stencilled earth twin this would major reason study know what with need use was also said the same paragraph and lines that earth the same density and size earth therefore would good planet study can learn more about planets that share sizes another piece evidence have from the text from paragraph lines venus may well once have been the most earth like planet out solar system that would major reason study this planet later that paragraph goes say how may have had been covered oceans and wildlife like earth why wouldn study that why belive the author did excellent job supporting his own claim that should studying venus,2
aliens not true the article unmasking the face mars have put out image the face mars this face was not made aliens becuase its like normal landform found earth authors made the public would attracted mars and was proven landform just like any other this not made aliens look alot like common land forms found earth from the ship point view its just were landform found earth first the text states the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte landforms common around the american west showing that just something found normally landmass second the unusual shadows the photos make look egyptair like something that would naturally form that kind climate lastly the jpl web site revealed natural landform and not alien monument authors who put out the photos the face mars made the public would attracted first all when people try making something interesting they could lie the article states the authors reasoned would good way engage the public and attract attention mars certainly did then something they said made huge hook this was put into hollywood film books magazines radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines lastly all this got people thinking that nasa would rather hide anything they really have about life mars what case have nothing hide because the face just normal land mass the face was proven landform first off befor was put out the public was said have looked like egyptian pharaoh nothing had with any other life form mars after was all put out the public and made into huge deal people started think were hiding something nasa when really stated could landform befor all was hollywood film books magazines radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines lastly states jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all proving was never anything made aliens,4
venus sometimes called the evening star venus planet where life can not exist because life surviving and high temperature conditions our solar system venus our second planet close our sun the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite dager presents there lot danger this planet life can found this planet the extreme temperature the sun which could degrees fahrenheit and times more the pressure the earth why would the author think that studying venus would good idea according the text astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like this show how the author that studying venus worthy another reason why the author suggest that studying venus would worthy pursuit despite the danger that venus was probably covered with oceans and could our nearest option for planetary visit according the text the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar feature sych valleys mountains and creates furthermore recall the venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel this supports what the author suggests what the author suggests something thost really worthy pursuit the danger presents because venus could even become the next earth near future,3
what will was luke point view try get some other people think they should participate will explain that you can enjoy the games they have when they have free time like say the text paragraph say luke also found time have fun board especially return trips after the animals had been unloaded the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games the empty holds where animales had been housed now you see all the fun things they and you get payed lot money and know don say that the text but can tell because they explore around the world like luke said luke had went europe china and acropolis and many other places and you can get some thing have idea this place again and tell your family you can also see all the pretty thing the new places you and learn new thing you let yourself you can learn something ever day that what will say the people that think just club something fun job will there sounds fun cant wait get high school and that,2
the support this idea and why dangers study venus the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these cognitions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth venus has the hotter surface temperature any planet our solar sytem venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes venus was probably covered eagerly with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar such valleys mountains and craters the national aeronautics and space administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans study venus nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans peering venus from snorting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions because most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms photography and videography ineffective more importantly researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance nasa working other approaches studying venus striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubs but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,3
gets frustrating when you don know whether your friend family member mad you just bad mood luckily there way thomas huang professor from the advanced science the university illinois has invented facial action coding system that allows you identify human emotions its great way stop all the confusion and know someone happy see you although its great tool for everyday life not great asset classroom using technology read the emotional expression students classroom not valuable because should focus teaching valuable material and its lack accuracy the classroom simply meant learn evidently there reason know what your student feeling and not feeling using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements like all devices this facial action coding system can have malfunctions instead wasting class time try the coding system you should use that time focus learning new valuable material and focusing school and nothing else however states able calculate emotions like math homework but sometimes get calculations wong she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry facial action coding system seems rate all the mona lisa emotions from what she feels the most least clearly stating that the coding system ranks all emotions from least greater not specifying what peston feeling futher more the facial action coding system great tool for everyday life but not not useful the classroom using this device will not only waste valuable time teach but its also lacking accuracy,3
the author this passage has supported his claim that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers extremely well the reasons supports himself well stating how venus was probably the most earth like planet our solar system and how would good challenge for scientists accept paragraph four the author asks this question our sister planet inhospitable why are scientists even discussing further visits its surface the author answers the question saying how venus might have been like earth this statement sparked curiosity among the scientists long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth with this statement scientists are eager find out this true and what happened the life forms the author proves that venus being similar earth worth the dangers knowing what happened the life forms venus may help prevent the same disaster happening earth the main dangers visiting venus the carbon dioxide the atmosphere the extreme surface temperature and the unbelievable atmospheric pressure continue research venus scientists would have get close the author uses the word challenge instead risk this describes how pursuing venus would innovation mankind the author supports this claim talking about how researchers are testing new technology continue work venus many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus when scientists achieve this goal and research venus who knows what next space exploration venus being challenge study worth the dangers because scientists conquer this they will able conquer anything conclusion the author supported their idea extremely well with concrete evidence that exploring venus worth the risk with the statement that venus could have held life forms and water shows that studying this planet neccessary also when study venus will prove that humanity can face any challenge that comes its way,5
there limit car usage car can really come handy but its not necessary gas not all that cheap for everyone either cars don need used for everything but since thats easy way get around people just take advantage that and use people can cause lots damage with the way they use there car weather people the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids take soccer practice ans schoolbus remains open question car can really help you out some cases but not necessary all there are lots other things you can help help out their are things you can get you places and also helping you out example riding bike gets you exercise and also take you places needing car isn needy anymore but america love affair with its vehicles seems cooling people can cause lots damage with there vehicles the amount care people have with driving ridiculous parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city their are sidewalks that have replaced rush hour restrictions that have dramatically cut traffic all these can happen for careless people instead following such simple things not only people use gas there car but also miles the number miles used your vehicle does matter the number miles driven the united states peaked and dropped steadily thereafter according analysis means car usage very high the united states opinion cars are necesssary for everything there are more use get places which may take longer faster but still getting there some advantages limiting your car usage yes there are much limits which are important people should really start using finding other way its good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution,2
for smart cars because they have upgraded safer driving people can drive all day and not get into accidents the process that scientists have now are wonderful there have been over cars wrecks this world because people are not smart drivers finally making differents safe traffic for people the road people had worry about being sewed for car wreck long time ago people never had cars but only horses and boats travel scientists have alot smart idea technogym now they are making cars that you can call text anybody without using cell phone scientists also created that only way you could listen the radio your seat belt buckled for safety the real age for people start should age because most teenagers are careless drivers nearly percent car accidents with teenagers now they start list they more mature for driving percent for accidents because drinking and driving percent falling asleep while still driving percent texting and driving percent speeding fast the road cause accidents the reason why for smart driving because people are making driving more safer the road instead getting into accident people should agreed which should have smarter cars not may let the people deeside right smart being safe,2
even though the era driverless cars seems approaching quick pace would not expect these inventions take off driverless cars first come off worthy devices for transportation but they will soon enough come into contact with conflicts and difficulties when looking these types cars one must consider factors such safety and convenience could this new mode transportation really great society driverless car development should reduced and held off laws across the states except for those such california nevada and florida have restricted aspects driving that would enable the use the driverless car most focus keeping the people general safe from harm let one say however that driverless cars are allowed become more used and tested within the united states new laws would have created order figure out who labile for accidents would the manufacturer the driver fault driverless cars would have jump obstacles such liabilities and state restrictions inorder even considered for use addition state conditions the conditions safety and attention for the driver must also considered the car drives itself the passengers the device may not even paying attention the events hand sure manufacturers have made ways for the car catch someone attention such vibrations flashing lights but such means can always reliable what the passenger driver asleep even medically impaired many will probably look the driverless car means safe transportation due physical mental disability accidents are prone happen the car itself can relied one hundred percent without human skills lastly there possibility that this new mode transportation won have enough budge take off even the new car seems like great invention might too expensive pull off for example google toyota prius uses multiple sets technology such radar sensors laster beans and cameras one were mass produce such complex device surely take mass amounts resources and money construct furthermore will drivers attracted driverless cars they might wonder whats the point getting the car has the chance still needing human correction the chances this new technology becoming more popular with society low and unpromising conclusion driverless cars have numerous case setbacks federal and state restrictions when comes driving handicap the cars from being used widely not all drivers will capalbo using such devices and everyone should accomodated for money and interest also have considered before even launching such complex invention driverless cars come with too many aspects that should set back development the upcoming years,4
driverless cars may out near future personally think that driverless cars will neat addition the worlds automobiles but may also bad due safety issues fully automated acris may cool idea depending how manufactures perse these ideas immagine needing long trip and not having stay awake for the whole drive then immediately crashing when you get your destination immagine being able sleep while you travel the world the comfort your own car imagine not having focus the rad all and able take part conversations and games while driving the road this could our future but may not very safe one the story says presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times agree with this statement because what would happen automated car looses connection dies while the road resulting collision causing people their lives who would fault you the manufacturer things like this have discussed before you can even think about seeing fully automated car any future regulations need set can pass laws that allow safe automated cars all the world automated cars will neat idea bring life but might little bit further into the future than you might think but may the next big step public transportation all need figure out what something happens while the road,3
the face mars you think the face mars was created aliens dont and going tell you why the face mars was not created aliens theres not enough evidence prove that aliens exist conspiracy theorists just want something obsess about the face mars was not created aliens few days after the face appeared nasa unveiled the image for all see also had caption saying huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth the authors said was good way engage the public and attract attenion mars they also stated that looked like the head egyptian pharoah since they unveiled the image the face mars has become pop icon even been stared holywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows and haunted grocery store checkout lines for while some people even think the face evidence life mars they say its evidence that nasa wolke kept secret said conspiracy theorists all while people who defence the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars few scientists even thought was alien artifact capturing photos cydonia had become priority for nasa when the mgs arrived the red planet september eighteen long years after the viking missions had ended jim garvin cheif scientist for nasa mars exploration program stated felt this was important taxpayers photographed the face soon could get good shot april cloudless day cydonia mgs drew close enough for seond look had roll the spacecraft degrees center the face the feild view said garvin malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution what they captured was rock formation have concluded the face mars was rock formation with shadows making the illusion eyes nose and mouth stated earlier basically the face was illusion face but reality was just gigantic rock formation with shadows but could see how conspiracy theorists would get the idea aliens,2
you believe driverless cars good alternative human driven cars would you feel comfortable letting your car most almost the time driverless cars means all the driving institutions and schools will out business and the workers those professions will out job personal opinion driverless cars that even though you might not have much the driving like you had before driverless cars took over you are putting your life and the lives the passengers your car with you risk believe that driverless care become thing companies that produce their own versions the driverless cars will put lot liability them computer the car were malfunction and maybe skid off the road killing everyone board the company who produced the car just killed few their customers google sergey believes driverless cars will take over and the car buying and selling industry will tank insurance companies could aslo out business because computers were take over control the car well then there wouldn any accidents people who buy these cars put much trust and faith into these cars thinking that since controlled computer percnet and knows everything about every road here the thing people forget that the computers the car and the gps systems radar and lot other technology was made man the people who built the board gps radar navigation and other systems could have messed the production the technology and maybe the gps had glitch and thought body water was road and drove their passengers into body water killing them overall opinion about driverless cars that they are not good safe alternative human driven car that controller living person belive more enjoyable drive car than have computer drive for you,3
the challege exploring venus not great idea studying venus worthy because closes our planet earth terms density and size while venus simple see from the distant but safe vantage posin earth has proved very challenging place examine more closely venus not great planet explore the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer our sun this shows that venus not safe planet explore the scientists are been send study venus the conditions surface venus allow scientists float above the roiling venusian landscape the temperature would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that the sea level earth however peering venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions because most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering astandard forms photography and videography ineffective,2
have you ever hurd are know about are solar system and whats all are solar system made alot things such ass oher planets stars arg rocks and different galleys out all the plantes earth the planet away from the sun venus has its ups and downs and what mean about this that venus has good reasons why people should study some bad reasons that are planets travail different speeds and previous mission spacecraft have ever survived the planet for more than few hours something else that very bad for you that its atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide and the surface the planet temperature reach degrees fahrenheit some good things about venus that closest planet earth terms density and size and sometimes close distance just like how earth now venus was once covered largely with oceans and could have supported life forms also venus had surace that rocky sediment with valleys mountains and craters conclusion venus has its ups and downs but believe that worth studding despite the dangers that come with also believe that should send spacecrafts there what are mre durable then the other ones that was sent there long time ago because the new technology that have think that its passable that could come with more samples different items,2
venus indeed very powerful planet that can cause harm the human race thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet paragraph yes there are lot dangers and the human race can hurt but what happens when the earth runs out sullies support the human race where will then important explore all the other options have when comes places for the human race when run out supplies and options yes venus has lot risk but when comes saving the human race think risk worth taking there are couple things that the earth and venus have common venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters there are postive things about venus well every option going have negatives and positives some our explores think they might have solution for humans live venus nasa possible soltis the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape just our jet airplanes travel higher altitude fly over many storms vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way paragraph there are lot dangers when comes living venus but might have solutions for them when comes the human race and having plan think this something consider yes there are quite few risk when comes moving the human race live venus but nasa thinks that they have way around that there couple things that earth and venus even have common when comes the geographical aspects the planets yes living venus comes with changes and yes would big change think risk worth taking,4
all humans can express the way they are feeling the feelings that are shown are one the following happiness suprise anger disgust fear and sadness not all are truthful the way they express for others see being high school student see many kids who are happy the outside but inside they are sad when person sad and covers their true feelings like blanket hard understand how help them with this being said must everything can truly figure out how students are feeling the classroom understanding the way someone feeling enables help them accomodate them some way for example man may through life appearing happy but inside truly sad since was wearing metaphorical mask happiness one was able understand his true feelings prof thomas huang beckman institute advanced science the university illinois has found way understand peoples emotion there may just solution that could help change societal problems relating schools such school shootings recently our schools have been not such safe enviroment due the high activity school shootings why exactly school shootings take place most cases because that person was not understood emotionally his her peers now with the facial action coding system would able understand who throughout our school feeling the angry and sad emotions huang stated that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal since the facial expressions are universal this statement only proves the accuracy the facs after knowing who these students are allows the counselors the school and talk them this breakthrough discovery may over looked some but could beyond valuable and beneficial when comes helping students who are hiding their feelings the aspects enforcing safety comes into play with this facial action coding system but this could not only minimize school shootings but can also beneficial the way students learn student angry class they are most likely not going listening the teacher they will focused whatever they are mad were able scan such kids could sit down with them and help reduce their anger attempts put them back track learn the students who show emotion make hard for teachers understand them when teacher makes student smile surpise them they are doing their job correctly now for student who unable convey his true emotions the teacher may not know the student understands the material being taught having the ability tap into the emotions student paramount discovery the benefits outweigh the negatives every category the implementation the facial action coding system within schools going beyond valuable this can the turning point the education system being able understand how students are feeling can reduce violence and ultimately allow for maximized learning,4
emptions there are different ways you can tell person happy sad but you have you ever thought you could everyone them once feel like you cant know for cherian what people are feeling becasue people only know what they truly feel there are ways you cant tell for examples there facial muscles you can tell the difference from real smile fake smile for guienne smile you will selee that the cheek bones lift the corner your mouth its fake smile your face stretches sideways you can also tell taking test computer you can imamate other peoples emotions for example your showing empathy for someone feel like person can feel lot different emotions and that may not the true one but you can try figure out doing these things has helped learn how figure people emotions better and especially when you take pic with them,1
driverless cars would good for people think this for many good reasons one because some people get tired behind the wheel sometimes two would stop drunk driving and three its giving people break gave the reasons why think its good idea now gon na explain point first point that some people get tired behind the wheel tired person behind the wheel not good they could end falling asleep and them falling asleep could cause crash nobody wants crash says the second paragraph their cars have driven more than half million miles without crash thats more then enough time for people get their destination without falling asleep thats just the first reason have lots drunk drivers the world with driverless cars drunk drivers wouldnt have drive and with them not driving one would get hurt and the wont jail not saying that its good for them getting car drunk saying that they wouldnt have drive they wouldnt have cause crashes cause their intoxicated would have less duis the world with this car last its giving lots people break know most people dont like drive and they wont break its helping them you will till have set driver sit pay attention but its still giving them break over all just thinks its good idea with this you would keep tired people from behind wheel drunk people from behind wheel and you giving people break its good idea just opinion,3
would driverless cars cool yes they would personally think would horrible idea have driverless cars personally think all our cars should driven human being instead robotic machine first off the prices these driverless would threw the roof and make then the cost insurance would threw the roof these automotives because how expensive they are make plus what theirs malfunction error the cars system the whole network crashes just because drivers get bored doesnt mean should make driverless car because the persons bored something then just dont drive point point its thats simple the only reason the car industries wants make driverless car becasue money the only reason the insurances would like this idea they can jack the prices whats the fuel ministry going like the cars still going gasped powerd battery powerd what perspective this topic this whole idea garbage some things agree with like braking system camra the back that way you dont run any thing over while your backing out your driving other than that this whole thing about the car industries and the insurance company making money thats all this whole thing about all this unecessary,2

driverless cars should not coming some people may think that this cool and fun idea but not safe for the driver pedestrians there are many flaws driverless cars that should addressed and taken seriously this situation could very dangerous the driverless cars can not even fully function itself having the car driverless someone could fall asleep from being bored they are expecting the car all the work and not need their help the car ended needing human assistance because they are not totally driverless the person would asleep and not take over which could cause wreck they could hit pedestrian and get arrested get charges pressed against them even worse the person wouldn have even been aware what was happening beacuse they were asleep and that could have gotten them injured well another flaw these cars that can cause people become very lazy everyone would get used not having drive themselves around they would start expecting not have even more things they would become very dependent other people and things around them would teach children not learn things for themselves and become independent they would expect everything done for them their parents siblings teachers etc the passage said they would have taxis the driverless cars and then one would have have cars anymore they make taxis the driverless cars and they not need any drivers that would result job loss for all the taxi drivers not everyone has college degree and can get big job being taxi driver all they can that taken away from them they are left with job and way pay bills provide for their families this would cause their families into debt and suffer just because there was now driverless cars driverless cars are not something that the world should have they can make people lazy are dangerous and could cause job loss just because seems like cool idea does not mean good idea other people around the world have taken into consideration and all the consequences the cars have looked and taken very seriously,3
one wants wach ads but wouldnt they more interesting there was way they could relate more the article making mona lisa smiley nick dalto talks about way that coding system can read our emotions the text they talk about program called facial action coding system that will use our emotions make our experience with technology better the technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable because ads can more personal can help keep students more interested and can make animated faces more expressive ads are example how the facial action coding system can valuable the text states for example yoy smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different dalto student doing something computer and pops for math game and doesnt like the next could change math game that does help the ads coud help the student find game that can help him learn ads and keeping the student mare interested are ways the facial action coding system valuable keeping the students interested also another way the facial action coding system can benfica student the text says classroom computer coud recognize when student becoming confused huanghe could recognize that then could modify the lesion the lesion would better for student and also would like having teacher right next you teaching you the way you learn best keeping the students interested another way the facial action coding system can valuable but there one more example the facial action coding system can make animated faces more expressive the author states the same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive dalto when taking online corse animated faces could more expressive would make the student more involved also could make the student feel like they have some one help right next them this how making animated faces more expressive can help students classroom this how ads can more personal can help keep students more interested and can make animated faces more expressive help support the claim that the use emotional reading technology can valuable for student making things more personal also keeping the student interested they dont get side tracked finaly keeping the student happy wouldnt you want more presinal experience when learning help keep you interested and more involved,4

there are many advantages limiting car usage affects your mental health effects your environment effects people and companies economically too these articles provide lot information and going use examples from the text show you first limiting car usage affects peoples mental health most people say makes them happier using different modes transportation when had car was always tense much happier this way said heidrun walter media trainer and mother two this example from the article german suburb life goes without cars written elizabeth rosenthal good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution said businessman carlos arturo plaza rode two seat bicycle with his wife here another example from car free day spinning into big hit bogota written andrew selsky although some people are mad having use bus train with other people good stress reliever not having drive all the time and not having deal with the road rage second limiting car usage effects the environment cars give off gas that not good for the earth the gas from the cars creates smog some parts the world paris typically has more smog than any other european capitals that quote from paris bans driving due smog written robert duffer shows that the smog having affect them safety also something that would increased limited car usage pedestrian bicycle private cars commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety with less cars around people would less likely get hit right now many people die every day from car accident hit and run lessen the amount cars the road also improve road rage and traffic flow finally limiting the amount car usage would effect people and companies economically people wouldn have pay for gas much they would have would help out public transportation companies like the company that runs the lynx busses the line chicago would cause decline auto insurance companies and car companies that sell the cars companies like ford and mercedes are already rebranding themselves mobility companies with broader product range beyond the personal vehicle this quote from the article the end car culture elisabeth rosenthal shows that car companies are trying stay ahead their competition they trying appeal people who prefer bikes buses rather than personal vehicle recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses each year goes this quote from the same passenger shows that already nearing this goal car usage already being limited the newer generations people who care about the planet and find easier bike use public transportation conclusion limiting the usage cars would help lot think that helping the environment would really good for people limiting the usage cars would make safer walk around and bike outside even drive helps people economically even though hurts certain companies economically also helps mentally helping less stressful and calming down more easily would reduce road race well certain stress all together,4
agree that using the facial action coding system the classroom valuable new software has been developed that improves accuracy perceiving the emotions others this new software the facial action coding system has promising applications for variety industries first all can recognize when student becoming confused bored could modify the lesson like effective human instructor the same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games video surgery most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication secondly the facial expression for each emotion are universal using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements real face painted face mona lisa weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions finally huang observes that artist such vinci studied human anatomy help them paint facial muscles precisely enough convey specific emotions his new computer software stores similar anatomical information electronic code you can see the facial acton coding system helps the classroom,1
mom going outside get some fresh air freeze wait one minute the air that you breath isnt all that fresh nor clean its polluted but check this out people want car usage end completely know you might think limiting car usage the worst idea you ever heard just stop pollution yes but you think about cars equal bad air china one the most polluted cities the world cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer air trap air comission but man man france blame diesel fuel the problem precent diesel fuel used france cars maybe that statement correct another reason why less car usages could good thing prevent being stuck traffic reduce alot car accidents businessman carlos arturo plaza stated that its good opportunity take away stress lower air pollution which highly agree with cars are very stressful they always breaking down something ends going wrong you spend tons and tons money just fixing the problem when had car was always tense much happier this way said heidrun walter media trainer mother two she walks verdant streets love listening her surrounding but god paris you get caught driving you will suffer dollar fine leave the car home please since this car usage thing started colombians hiked biked skated took buses work school there goal promote alternative transportation and reduce smog the sidewalks have been replaced bogota broad could smooth and easier ride president obama goals are get greenhouse gas would lower emission and improve safty think would sorta good idea would through with car usage would much healthier and cleaner environment,2
belive that the driverless cars should allowed the driverless cars can help drivers many situations the driverless cars can things driver can not fast the driverless car the driverless cars could still controled drivers areas where the system would not able drive respond the situation the article many instances says that driverless cars would still have drivers situations could not navigate the driverless cars would fully functioning itself and with the driver would not just robot driving around itself the driver would still have aware the situation the car would get there attention avoid accidents the driverless cars would still have drivers side them there are many reasons why the driverless cars should and should not aloud but belive that they should there are many reasons why they should and these were only some them driverless cars are safe and should aloud opinion and that why support driverless cars,2
would tell them that other scientists have looked and its not face then would say that martian mesa and thats looks like face but you your research right you will like got would say that they got many these kind face shaped things the west but would also say that was cloudy around that planet this time year would say that maybe the clouds formed face like figure cause many times have went outside and have seen cloud that looks like face and that even the wind blowing the clouds stay one form would say some researches have looked into and they have snapped pictures face like figure but turns out natural landform last would say that the face like figure equivalent the lava dome and about the same height the face mars,2
mesa form all the time and they are natural occurance and they should not considered differently just because the land formation looks like face mesa form due rocks that pile nad form when emotion occurs from wind and other nutrients and minerals brush over the rock and the wind loose minerals that cause the mesa look like face nutrients and minerals loosen and crack over time strong winds blow over formations and look like they are faces trees and other land for matins fenians the scientists have proven this over the years adn even done tests and studies cherian emotion types some different erosion types are wind oceans rain and other natural causes that over the years have caused thing fade away mineral mineral brick brick you can see through the pictures the years the cameras used the space ships adn space things have evolved like erudition only difference that erosion bad sometimes technological advances have occured througout the years and this even another sign emotion some the tiem advancements can abad thing becasue natural resources are lost advances and emotion stomachs can erode thing the acids them they eat away the food inside and can fast can slow the face the planet mars considered face because looks like one humans can look like animals but they arn technically the face there becasue eof the mineral build and the rocka dust that have collected there becasue the strong winds and the mild winds and just winds genal the mineral build grew and the winds picked the minerals and dust blew away and then went somewhere else this particular arguement going ended saying that right your wrong and your going look all this and find out theat emotion and minerals are all natural and then you will come back adn thank you dont look odd when some asks you about the face,3
dear senator feel the need bring the electoral college your attention think keeping the electoral college not good way vote for the president the united states unfair way vote electors and the majority votes elect the president seems have problems every time the person running for office has more votes obviously means they want that person win the election why around that process and change everything and make more difficult for the person win people all over keep trying change things with voting but don have choice when they vote for someone office doesn equal whole percent which actually goes towards whether not they will will not president thanks the electoral college makes things harder thats why people don like vote senator please think about getting rid the electoral college fair that the person with the most votes should win because everyone voted for them they wanted that person win that more fair than popular votes and then what the other people have say sincerely proper name,2
humans one the many smart species planet earth the species that seems think they can anything including going venus although venus highly dangerous with its high temperatures and extreme clouds carbon dioxide worthy pursuit that could great benefit for the knowledge anybody living earth the information that could gathered rather incredible already this world knows few features venus holds the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters amazing think that already have this idea planet with hard work and dedication could valuable further investigate our sister planet even though the conditions the planet are critical know the dangers there benefit the planet solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans the author knows what say because they know that the conditions are harsh and great reward the scientists recieve what they would need from this raging planet the value this planet not known only because there not enough strive make happen the human curiosity what leads this planet greatness scientist that want this mission have willing whatever takes for knowledge they have get close and personal despite the risks those risks will lead everything that scientist could hope for there reason not believe the author when they say the mission will worth your while only because there something magnificent about that planet similar ours the author confidently states our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation they beautifully say what needed imagination and the need innovate for future greatness important for the challenges ahead although this world still has unknown factors finding out incredible things about venus could change science and could change the world itself venus our sister planet one the closest how has our natural kick for curiosity not taken over humans always want know everything making clear there point just letting this fantastic adventure wait danger always component exploring something new that why humans are knowledgable and powerful scientist should not hold back they need bring all their smarts this adventure and really make something great could result the most indulging finds,4
facial action coding sytem should used because good way help students and people first off think this being used students really good idea because some students needing help and they are scared ask for help and this way the computer can help and make the lesson easy for the students this might give the students moure confidence doing something and trying also student bored this will make the lesson not boring for the student this good way help people what they are going through something and they need help want talk somebody but dont want tell anybody the facial action coding can let somebody know and friends family can take action plus cool because you can find out alot things about old pictures like you want find out just see how somebody feeling you can use that this really cool becasue you can find out alot feelings just picture lets talk about the mona lisa they used this her and found out how she was feeling that painting she was feeling happy for the most part but little bit other emotions with that this really cool way communicate with people this also cool way make movies and video games better and more rexall felling you know this can sence muscle your face and will let you know how your felling just your expression have expressions every day but sometimes can hard tell how are feeling most people dont know how other people feel but this can let other people understand what they are going through this can also let people track the emotion they want know that person feeling yes think that this system should used can help alot this would very useful alot things,3

the classroom most students are very bored and tired many students are not happy with spending the day school teachers all over the country are collaborating find things that interest students technology hitting almost every school currently and bring kids school more eager learn now there computer software system created thomas huang and nicu sebe that can detect someones emotions this program detects persons emotions looking how the muscles work example this progam when the author describes mona lisa and says she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry technology should used read the emotional expressions students during class becasue will help teachers find ways make education exciting for students although sometimes people can read someones emotions not possible every time student could act like they are enjoying school when they are really not some cases students may not sad because they are school but becasue something happening them outside school paragraph eight the author says meanwhile muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palabras make crow feet around your eyes but false smile the mouth stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and different muscle the pistorius this example how sometimes people can not read someones emotions also the program would allow teacher change his her lesson plans due how students enjoy the teaching style classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused board huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor many students not use words express how they feel about something this way find out they enjoy the teaching style not schools are able get technology that detects emotions will help with how they need organize the day and how make more fun for students learn this will lead increase passing and graduation rates very important educate students becasue the students today will leaders the future society,3
venus the closest planet earth terms density and size venus planet the solar system the second planet from the sun has proved very challenging place examine more closely venus often referred earth twin earth venus and mars our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun different speeds thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the difference speed means that sometimes are closer mars and other times venus because venus something right around the corner the space terms human have sent numerous space craft land the cloud draped world space craft survived the landing for more than hours beyond high pressure and heat venusian geology and weather present earthquakes amd frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land surface venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer our sun the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has one particular compelling idea for sending human study venus nasa posible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the frays arriving meet our challenge presented venus has big value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into manually,1
cars they werntz invented the old days who needs them not screw cars ill tell what need know about life and transportation can limit car use just use this information and use your life paris has much smog one likes that lets limit car use paris has micrograms matter cubic meter measurement dang taxes hate soccer moms mom one cant hate them too much all they drive everywhere and use all the resources there kid can strike out little leauge now will tell you how fix this problem some the stupid soccer moms driving around there rolling egg mini van the car use would cut half then you might say then what little kid going you can read bicycle places just like said line car free day spinning into big hit bogota now ill tell you what kind bike and what your gon na with and your gon na love bmx bike what talking about you can transporte the skatepark ride the ramps its really fun and love those gas using mini vans would off the streets and bmx bikes can take over think about our earth for once please well conclude things car use overused highly mainly the soccer moms fault fix all the problems the world everyone needs get bmx bike and ride some dirt jumps and this world would happier place,2
think that limiting car usage great for the environment there are lot benefits that come from use car less then greenhouse gas emissions will decrease and thus cleaning the air smog some the benefits that limiting car use that decreases poisonous smog lots cities the world are doing and last but not least could promote other ways travel its about time that the world start changing some harmful habits start reducing car use very effective when trying get rid smog some cities such paris smog big pollution there paris they even went head head with beijing china which known one the most polluted cities the world paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air this globally known city enforcing this some days cars with even numbered license plate could drive the next day odd numbered cars could drive you were caught then you were fined paris doing this congestion was down whopping paris after just days this would cut down greenhouse effects tremendously far reducing car use sounds pretty good furthermore paris isnt the only place the world this bogota colombia program that set spread other countries millions colombians either hiked bike skated took bus commute around the country their destination this known car free day this car free day left the streets the capitol void and empty rush hour traffic even the goverment considering the international event that also helping the environment the same time another thing reduce greenhouse gas people would find more alternative way transportation city buses could count alternative because think bus could seat people think all people had their own car then the emission amount would substantially increase vehicles rather than vehicle other ways transportation are things such bikes skates skateboard just walking none those alternatives release any type emissions way not using cars sounds great many ways but there are those people out there that rely the usage cars transport themselves such anyone with physical handicaps maybe this the start something new but what happens this earth all what deicide with rather wont last can just let and lose the one planet have left,4
are you kidding you actually think that figure mars was created aliens yeah isn aliens then who what made that face mars dont know how that got there but telling you now wasn made aliens you can see the three different photos showing the figure mars was just misunderstanding the photo looks blurry but and photos you can see more cleary the article states the camera board mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face that means the clouds made look like face also during the pixels the camera could have been bad could take clear pictures the image shows more clearly that means technology has gotten better according the article says each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo that proves that the camera was better then the camera nobody will ever know aliens made that figure mars that looks like face could have been butte mesa for example the passage states there must have beem degree surprise among mission controllers back the jet propulsion lab when the face appeared their monitors scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh there proved you that the face mars was just mesa don care what you say sticking opinion okay what ever know right and you wrong,3

did you know that venus the brightest point light the sky sometimes people look the sky they see venus and they think just star some people call evening star wich not often use becuase venus planet venus also call the earth twin this nickname given because venus one the closest planet earth terms density and size lately scientists are discussing about making visits venus the article states that astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system wich makes them think that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported forms life scientists know that venus has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such mountains craters they claim that venus can sometime our nearest option for planetary visit which curial consideration given long time frames space travel conclusion the author this text has given proves that the national aeronautics and space administration well known nasa has been studying possible ways venus wich could take long time temperatures there are very high for human been nasa working other approaches studying venus they had simplified electronics made silicon carbide wich have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks the condition they would experience venus strongly agree that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the danger presents,3

society techology almost every thing people people around the world hundred thousands worth technology lots people spend more money technology than they clothes think having technology makes people happy having technology see makes them happy kinda point less there nothing the facial action coding could for people the world you ask putting ads that based off your emotion not smart idea angry most likely will have negative vibe and you put something that close negative its not going make happy good mood more than likely would not want see then there expression compared against neutral face some people just look naturally mad some one regular face looks mad then how would read ther face then that person could happy think the facial action coding system waste time,2
have you ever wondered what would like explore planet while fighting through the dangers the planet brings what about planet that ground level has far more extreme conditions than humans can handle this what exploring our planetary neighbor venus would like even though the author claims would worthy make the dangerous trip venus does poor job supporting his claim the author uses credible source nasa but the author fails back why the pursuit worthy the information from nasa talks about possible solutions the harsh conditions venus but not about why the trip should made despite all the harsh factors the text states nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape the author has valid reasoning for solutions but this information does not mention why would benefit risk lives just make the adventure the author also includes abundance information about how dangerous and risky venus and yes important know these facts but the beginning the article the author seems scare the audience into not traveling venus paragraph states the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth such environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquify many metals the author goes into detail about just how deadly venus would humans instead was trying prove that worthy point the author should been lighter about these facts and not gone into such scary vivid detail the author also could added counterargument this paragraph instead waiting until later the essay start showing what was actually trying prove the author could included more evidence support his view but did provide one piece sufficient evidence paragraph reads long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth this piece shows that some scientists want explore venus for its ancient possible ability explore life but the author needed support his claim with other information other than strictly this paragraph ultimately the author did have evidence his article but there needed more order make his claim well supported and also more credible exploring venus may good idea but the author claim wasn clear enough throughout the essay able understand his point the only time the author claim was clear was the conclusion when stated reasons why venus should explored all all the author did poor job supporting his idea the worthiness traveling venus despite all the dangers brings with,5

new planet new home hard leave something that you really loved mom stated rebecca sayao here this case really hard when the things they get used will going disappeared gone when something gone they need get find another one they can find the same like this just like duplicate but this case leaving home finding new one was hard because all the memories are there finding new one was hard they need transport all the things that they left there home the challenge exploring venus the author suggest that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers present because same earth human curiosity and the planet earth will disappeared after how many decades first some cases planet earth and venus have some similarities the venus has some good nature too paragraph said there that the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet explain here that the planet venus has more atmospheric pressure than earth also paragraph said there that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth explain here that even the scientist discovered that the venus and earth have same similarities and the nature venus can supported life second because the human curiosity the scientist want know what going our neighbor planet paragraph state there that our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation explain here that the people should not make story they should know their limits when comes imagination and telling story that not true paragraph said there that nasa working the approaches studying venus explain here that because the curiosity the nasa the scientists that work that try explore things outside the earth since the people are curious what happening some planet they used technology because the curiousity they used some technology and invented new one that has many gears can reach the venus but because the heat the venus the gadgets they invented was not working will work how many decades then after that will crashed again because the venus temperature last the earth will slowly disappeared after how many decades hard when the earth disappeared that why the scientist try investigate new things outside our earth they trying figure out when where the people will live after the earth disappeared they should examine fast they can the people can move different planet because who one knows when will planet earth will explode paragraph said there that venus the second planet from our sun while venus simple see from the distant but safe vantage point earth has proved very challenging place examine more closely explain here that they trying figured out the venus because the venus should have same characteristics earth because not the scientist should try search more information other planet hard examine something when new paragraph said there that often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too explain here that this good sign because the people need the same characteristic earth have until now they still working they try figured out more soon possible the people earth can move venus conclusion the planet earth and venus have same similarities while venus more danger because the characteristics and material still the process exploring venus was still process the human curiosity lead the scientist search more what outside earth the earth will exploded after how many decades because the global warming and the people earth should evacuate soon possible life must even are living different planet,5
electric cars are good thing for the future will while before they are perfected however think they will have positive impact the road first reason for thinking electric cars are good the sensors paragraph talks about all the sensors toyota prius this helps driver out with lot things second the electric car ability detect things certain situations this will help out with places that are hard see this feature will prevent lot wrecks from happening paragraph says laws are against these cars paragraph talks about how they are very limited right now however this what time for they are not perfect right now but there will lot more them years when the improve even more they will good for the road few years the sensors will help out whole lot last the ability detect certain things will decrease the amount wrecks therefore electric cars will have positive impact the road,2
opinion think driverless cars are bad idea think they are incontinent believe that bad things could happen there were driverless cars such accidents and death itself lastly believe that malfunctions can and will happen driverless cars this essay will explain why think driverless cars are bad idea for more then one reason start off with driverless cars are not completely driverless right now therefore they are very continent because they can not through work sites traffic areas where most people wouldn want drive through details taken from the passage are google cars aren truly driverless they still albret the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents experience find driving through work cites little scary because you have maintain slow speed and make sure you not hit anything injure anyone with workers the road makes scary well because accidents can happen but you never want them occur opinion this huge inconvenience for people who get nervous driving through these areas secondly believe that bad things could occur from driverless cars such malfunctions causing car maybe stop working with you inside would possibly the car losing control itself and you being injure because this they have driverless cars right now that are not completely driverless and you have drive for certain parts the road but what this dosen work and the car continues drive through work cite with speed limit mph going speed mph someone would end getting hurt and you would end with big fine jail time taken from the text itself new laws wille needed order cover liability the case occident fhe technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer this means that something bad happens one knows who wil blamed next cars can malfunction adn there have been recalls the past because things that have gone wrong for example brakes not working causing death toll what car brand wants someone look their cars and then see death toll due the fact that the car companies brakes didn their job and person couldn stop driverless cars have many sensors started from the text for starters they needed whole lot sensors sensors and almost anything else can malfunction for reason all because how many sensors would completely driverless car there way insure that every sensor will work properly and make sure mistakes will made some people may say that times are changing and technology all time high and they would correct however not believe that driverless cars are the future believe that they are dangerous and could more harm then good that why opinion driverless cars are bad idea for more then one reason,4
drive driverless driverless cars are just what the name states cars without need have driver present this could big part our futures but whether will help our future drivers hurt them the main importance personally not think that driverless cars are going more harm than good our future drivers today get your drivers licence you have hold permit for one hundred eighty days and have pass written test followed driving portion the test with instructor these conditions you have follow able drive normal car are intense because you are being put onto road that could potentially harm another humans life your own life the precautions you have take are endless while driving and the risk you are putting yourself immense having driverless cars where you still have control part the time just causes even bigger distraction especially for younger newer drivers you could talking and suddenly have stop manually and not have enough time make there because you were distracted something else another reason that driverless cars have negative effect the future the economy make normal car cost lot money but make driverless car would cost twice that more because the type technology you would need use make them run properly having normal cars puts your life into harms way and teens are bad enough when comes staying focused being attentive and staying cautious with normal cars putting teens behind the wheel cars that uses computer controling device run teaching them nothing but pure laziness not focus your one hundred percent attention and stay alert when comes driving driving very serious matter that people already abuse laws and regulations for give people another excuse why the accident happened why they wrecked into pole should not come from our local car dealerships and manufacturers together community need stop the driving problems directly and not give people more advanced technology just they have another excuse why accident occured,3

imagine going outer space and you land mars when you get there you find landform that you haven seen before this could something big but you know isn alive you have assume landform when you back and show everyone what you found people think alien but further investigations show natural landform this face natural landform because one has ever seen something like this before one has any proof that human alien and nasa and the mars global surveyor say landform first all one has seen anything like this before the text states there must have been degree surprise among mission controllers back the jet propulsion lab when the face appeared their monitors this peirce evidence shows that the face new them and they don know what another piece evidence twenty five years ago something funny happened around mars this also shows that nasa doesn know what one knows what then you can say human alien without knowing the facts secondly one has any proof that could alien human for instance the text states scientists figured was just another martian mesa this piece evidence shows that they can figure out exactly what the face they are making assumptions what the face might but they aren one hundred percent sure what nasa would have have proof say alien not lastly when mars global surveyor arrived the red planet found out the face was natural landform for example the text states thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform this shows that once they got clear picture the face the jpl found out was just ordinary landform the text also states what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west this piece evidence found the text shows that nasa figured out that the face was landform yes the face did look like human but the nasa found out was landform when they closely examined the conclusion the face that was thought alien human was clearly natural landform first all was never seen before one could sure what was secondly people just assumed was alien human and they had proof that was lastly the mars global surveyor found out the face was natural landform this evidence shows that face everyone thought was alien was actually natural landform,4
opinion driverless cars would positive thing take action here the future reasons are more industries are working towards making driverless cars they can drive steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when unwedded driverless cars can also mimic the skill human the wheel and things their own more industries are working towards making new driverless cars the text states tesla has projected release for car capable driving autopilot percent the time the text also states mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have cars that can drive themselves the information above states that more companies industries are looking forward having driverless cars here soon the future next reason for driverless cars that they can drive just like human with driving skills the text states they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents the text also states the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel the information above clearly states that the cars can steer accelerate and break themselves with human like skills last reason for driverless cars that they can mimic the skill human driver and things their own the text states further improvements sensors and computer hardware and software make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more and more driving tasks their own the text also states dubbed lidar uses laser beams form constantly updating model the car surroundings the information above evidence from the text that driverless cars can mimic the skill human driver and things their own conclusion for driverless cars because industries are working towards driverless cars next reason for driverless cars because they can drive steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when unwedded last reason because they can mimic the skill human driver and thing thier own the reasons above are why favor for driverless cars,4
what the facial action coding system process begins whe the computer constructs computer model the face all major muscles the model must move like human muscles movement one more muscles called action unit the man thing weather not this facial action coding system should used read emotional expressions students classroom value but there can some good things about this and there can some bad things about this the pros the computer can read the kid struggling with something and the teacher could come help the kid also the computer can read the kid depressed and needs help with something going his her life the cons invasion privies but with all these pros and cons think should have the farcical actions coding system first reason why should have these computers for school the artifical the author says classroom computer could recognize student becoming confused bored what this means kid struggling confused the computer can read that the kid need help the thing working and the teacher can come help the kid also the good thing the kid confused and needs help but the kid shy scared ask questions the computer can tell the teacher she needs help what they are working last the computer knows the person confused the computer can stop what the kiedis doing and help that person what they are doing this first reason why need this computer system all schools second reason the computer can read kids emotions and can help the person fact humans perform this same impressive calculation every day for instance you probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face corse most would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc this shows person depressed and needs help but scared tell anybody the computer can tell that friend that friend can help that person out also this can tell person angry and the actions that person could when they are angry helping that person out and other people around them beacuse the actions that person can while they are mad last this device can save lifes people who think suicide beacuse the computer can warn popel these sighs helping the person out and many more people this second reason why all schools should have the computer system third and last reason the computer can help that person happy they are sad and depressed according facial feedback theory emotions putting happy face actually works also imagine computer that knows when you happy sad for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different what this saying you are watching something and comes and makes you happy the computer know that you like and would more like that but comes you dont like and frown the computer knows that and will change fast you stay happy with this computer doing that could keep lot kid happy this third reason why all schools should have this computer system some people not agree with some people may say that adding your private but think the computer should beacuse the computer can svane lives also help kids learn last can keep kids happyland not sad with the computer doing all this can keep healthy life style and safer enviroment for every body this why all schools should have this computer system save lifes help kids and keep kids happy,5

beep beep beep that the sound someone heart monitor hospital can you imagine waking the hospital after car wreck well happened plenty times but the accident was never caused driverless car what about the new laws they will have make for these new cars these cars will never happen and they they will cause many accidents the future the article had just read says even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident say you were get wreck while driving driverless car and the car wouldn use its break you went through stop sign and hit another car and someone was killed the accident who fault your fault for hitting the other car the manufactures fault for not safely making your vehicle driverless cars are not safe and never will technology always has glitch somewhere the article driverless cars are coming the talk about sensors paragraphs four seven the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel this was said paragraph seven the article but why would they make these driverless cars they can only reach mph most people would want driverless car for interstates and highways because those are the most boring roads history driverless cars are not safe they can cause many accidents and who fault you the manufacturer companies just need stop trying make driverless cars because they aren going sucessful for society today cars need human driven and that all driverless cars are coming not now not ever,4
using technology read students emotions something great value and could useful have the classroom according paragraph computer can recognize the subtle facial movements humans use express how feel meaning teachers could know when their students are confused and get them right back track teenagers have become very good holding how they feel best authorities know emotions are key todays society technology advancing rapidly best people use when helpful this technology could put use many ways whether that finding out how well students are learning figuring out how students feel personal level ehrich could depressed anxious excepted etc article making mona lisa smile paragraph states most would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc this rains true the classroom when students get confused some won even speak but hide their facial trait technology could used hurt help and best students recieve more help how others feel very important dictates the way they everything whether someone angrily making cup coffee joyfully talking friends their sons soccer game paragraph states then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this provides additional help keep students track and not stressed students are valuable and any technology used help them life should considered valuable well,3
driverless cars are seeming become more reality than idea with todays technology driverless cars would possible and there are even some right now personalty think driverless cars could good idea but there are many complications the moment these complications involve mostly law issues like driver were get into accident and who would put blame through out history driverless car have been made going all the way back the late this proves that the technology available and possible think they could beneficial our society because the driver gets distracted then there would not crash because they are not actually driving the cars today however still need driver ready take over certain conditions they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents paragraph the cars need for assistance would reduce the number crashes because the driver didnt take over and the car got stuck there would large traffic build that could lead injury the driverless car would remove the risk human error when tired distracted even under the influence they would also nearly perfect when comes driving because certain sensors the vehicle the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone paragraph theses sensors not only make the car safer but they also help the car handle more tasks their own further improvements sensors and computer hardware and software make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more driving tasks their own paragraph many the cars that are meant driverless will also using half the fuel used cars today this also reducing the amount pollution the world making eco friendly well the cars can also monitor the driver sure that they are paying attention the road and not texting sleeping there have been many developments make sure the driver alerted when the car comes against road block has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over the car other options under consideration are flashing lights the windshield and other heads displays paragraph these would sure that the driver prepared take over the car all times and not distracted conclusion driverless cars can greatly benefit the comunity increasing vehicle saftey and being eco friendly there may some consequences the moment but time they will sorted out and delt with the driverless car one not the safest option for the drivers and pedestrians this age time,4

with the new use technology the ability read someones emotion the simplest look within our grasp the ability read your emotion easy said done why not put something like this that can read out faces inside school trapasso their privacy even during school would not come handy with any student anytime during the day being watched face recognition the home many event many would not agree with during the school year for example high school where would facial action coding system fit into this would not benefit our education other than waste the new technology being used students detect their emotions privacy violation students would not want their face being read and pictured new face detection for example the story says imagine being able detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions with this being said this technology invades our space some students don want their emotions being let out they might want keep that private information themselves unless they release themselves this could happen anyone even without them realizing for example sitting the right position across from the facial action coding system the victims emotion may violated without their concentus the story reads you smile when web appears your screen similiar might follow but frown the next will different this text shows program reading your face real time for all the time you are your own laptop having your own computer reading your face every second while being your own home would not welcomed many violation privacy use and our freedom conclusion the facial action coding system would not use for students our minds and face are focused different direction rather than facing this machine read out emotions whether this new technology useful not would not good use for classroom full faces,3

think that having self driving cars would help alot there are many wrecks the states because some people just dont know how drive right was invent and sell computerized cars could stop from having many wreaks plus would also cause drive way safer for instance your drunk and you have get home you just sit the car and will drive for you since you cant yourself because your not the right stae mind there also the thought making better roads but when you think about that would cost more then fortune one other reason all for this invention because you know that the people making these cars are gon na earn tone money that means more people will switching the new car instead their old one before you know there will something new and even better technology since just keep getting smarter over the years who knows might driving hover craft later few years because alot can learned although would also have make some new laws change few them like the text states that what somone gets wreak smart car should the driver blamed the companies that sold the the car that person beheld responsible there also still some improvements that have made before they can even start selling those cars those are the main reasons that think making smarter cars great idea,3
position driverless cars that should wait until they are more efficient when you still have take control when you get certain obstacles don think there point the reason want driverless car can sleep while being drivin when you still have pay attention and ready take control seems kind useless all for the use and development these driverless cars but not until they can figure out how make work better tesla creates the car they say they are then what happens when you are asleep and drunk reckless driver crashes into you will they have way for the car react instantaneous situations wouldn feel safe enough driverless car least not until the majority the population has one everyone had driverless car then you wouldn have worried about being killed drunk reckless driver the car might able recognise dangerous situation but the other car traveling fast enough will you able react time these are the only concerns have with driverless cars and excited for the time can get and car and sleep while takes places for driverless cars they are proven somewhat safe because trust myself more than car,3
the article making mona lisa smile the author explains that new peirce technology can calculate humans emotions called the facial action coding but really worth the students time use technology just learn about theirs other feelings its just waste time the technology can only one thing the article shows and its just show what one emotion are the article paragraph states that fact humans preform this same impressive calculation every day for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face this cleary shows just looking friends face you can tell they are okay not dont need device for paragraph states for example you smile when web appears your screen similar appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different this shows that just facial expression can chainage but really that helpful not many people watch ads they skip them paragraph also states most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication this shows that human communication nonverbal for good part but why does emotional communication need useful what would with the results got when test the emotion device text friend and show what youre feeling for quick second students will maybe use first but will get tired because just shows emotions and nothing else paragraph states your home cant handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile this states your home computer cant show the emotions that means you will need certain device and that will expensive why would school spend lots and lots money just for venice that shows emotions tahta nobody will eventually use also paragraph states these are the instructions for face that looks happy they even indicate the difference between genuine smile and forced one this shows the indication forced smile and real one but which people can tell thier friends have real fake smile conclusion not need device tell our emotions can tell out emotions and our freind can too this device waste time and money for students the students will use couple times and wont use because its programmed only one thing and thats show our emotions this device not valuable for students just show emotions,3
being known earth twin venus planet most people are familiar with having rocky surfaces sediments and mountains this planet was most likely very close earth long ago the author states that the surface temperature reaches degrees and the atmospheric pressure times greater than earth then the idea brought what lived venus exploration this planet has begun and with profound dangers scientists are still pursuing the idea venus planet that has tough conditions but still may suitable for life venus poses some very intense conditions such environment something humans could never survive our sister planet inhospitable why are scientists even discussing futher visits surface the author states that scientist noticed venus was close characteristics earth large oceans probably covered oceans and could even supported living organisms venus the closest planet terms density and size because earth similarities venus scientists see this opportunity for collecting data and planetary visits the upfront dangers planetary visits are extreme not mention going planet with the heat liquify metal despite these challenges the author states can not let dangers get the way exploring striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead many equally intimidating endeavours our exploration should not keep from collecting data and finding things about our earth and solar system the author explains need meet the very edge imagination and innovation venus has many dangers seeming make impossible for humans any life survive despite all this scientist continue strive for planet exploration venus planet that has tough conditions but still may suitable for life,3
the author supports the idea pursuing the planet venus giving all the benefits could obtain from visting this planet what our planet earth could benefit and learn about planet venus having the ability learn about there was something there before and trying improve the conditions the area now that humans and animals from earth could possibly live nasa were figure out way onto the planet they could look and obtain samples rocks gas and anything else conduct research the things that are that planet and learn things that they not know about the planet being able view the analogous planet earth and see first hand what can compared and contrasted about the valleys mountains and craters would give nasa the chance see what kind organisms may may not have lived the planet the past could help the people that are planet earth understand what kind innovations and improvements could made and possibly create living conditions for organisms the present the future would also give better idea what the planet rather than depending photography videography venus considered our sister planet because the most alike and also the closest planet viewing this and the things could big deal for planet earth and also will great idea see and test what around,3
the value using this technology read students can useful every day life anyway when look our friends and can tell something wrong when you come home and your mom can always tell something wrong these computers could tell students not understand and are confused they get and understand these computers tracks your emotion recognition states parah some kids are ariad raise there hand you would not have raise your hand then you dont get the teachers would already know that you dont get huang saw that artists studie human anatomy help them paint facial muscles also emotions states parah this could help out teachers and students alot students would not have scared when they are confused teachers would know that you not get they can help you out till you get when are just having bad day teachers would know that and they dont get you for being angry when they call you try talk you this why for using technology read students emotions expressions,2
how would you feel had technology read students face feel like that technology can tell you happy sad anger disgusted anything because you can just make any face can just say what mean not saying that technology not smart now days know that technology can all type things feel like don need them type thing the classroom feel like people don want show they feelings lot people want keep things they self all want keep lot thing are self the face scan reading people emotional not right but people something deep feel like you should share because you can hide lot things life feel like the sametime should and shouldn have this face scanning emotional feel like people think good have for them self feel like should get because lot human perform this impressive calculation everyday because you can probably tell how friend feeling simply look her face but the safe side can tell how people are doing because some people lying about how they feel would you every use technology read students emotional yes can tell how they are doing and the feeling well bad today feel like students should show they feeling because would know how person feel intel they tell,2
the author supports studying venus despite the danger brings many ways venus the closest planet earth that humans could possibilty and explore but there are many enviromental issues venus that could not with stand alternative was given could far above the surface venus but still would get the full inscription venus venus just like earth some ways but would never able there due the conditions venus has human went venus even taking every safty precaution there ever was they would still die thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these conditions are far extreme than anything humans encounter earth such enviroment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquefy many metals but maybe there different way could explore venus alternative was given nasa most likely the only way humans would ever able encounter venus any way going above venus surface where the conditions would bearable and looking venus from that perspective nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape just our jet air planes travel higher altitude fly over many storms vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth solar power would plentiful and radiation would exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans this idea seems the only way ever able see venus humans did successfully did venus may could discover amazing things that would never could even begin think existed ever venus mystery humans and want know what that mystery going venus would expand our knowlege know about planets our solar system today could possibilty discover many new species rocks life and many other extrasensory things striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead many equally intimidating endeavors our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation saying that going venus would huge pro for humans finding new discoveries could possibly change the world venus extrano place that humans have idea about going venus would improve the world today many ways exploring other planets and what could possibly find would end all the curiosity and being new inventions for the world today the author for sure supported the idea about going venus and studying despite the dangers its presents the author provided many details and explanation prove supported this idea,4
exploring venus comes with high pay off but high risk the authors claim correct becuase has enough information back the idea venus geographical and atmospheric conditions would not ideal but would provide arnthor option for colonization the future the exploration venus worth while scientific ender the authors study venus provides enought facts and evidence conder further evaluation the planet long ago venus was probably covered large oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today the planet has surface temperature degrees farin height also the planet has much higher atmospheric pressure over times greater than earth venus closer our plant than thought even thought its atmosphere contains clouds that are made out highly corrosive acid the surface has rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys countians and craters the terrin showmen ruff but not unbearable for human colonization also venus one the closest planets own own planeta most others the due the ground conditions being hostile surveyors would need located more miles above the surface the planet exploring venus would benfica and worth while scientific ender over the years venus has been topic study due its earth like qualities the temperature venus not friendly humans our own atmospheres one the closest planets own planet than most others lastly the exploration venus can the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet,2
driverless cars will important and interesting technology the future because driverless cars there will new laws new rules drive and that driverless cars can help reduce the amount wrecks and casualties that are from car wrecks think that driverless cars should allowed long can prove that they are safe the road proven that they will safe and not danger others driving then think that driverless cars should allowed new laws will come into effect driverless cars are invented and legal the streets probably the biggest one would the car causes wreck and someone injured the drivers fault the manufacturer the cars fault this argument could both ways because the driver was not paying attention and did not take over drive then the wreck would his fault the driver had nothing with the wreck and that the car quits working correctly then would the manufacturers fault because their driverless car was defective another thing that would change when driverless cars are created will that there will new driving rules that everyone must follow you would have take new drivers tests make sure you know how drive when driverless car the road also the driverless car quits working then the driver would need manually drive the car you would have have your drivers license even the driver driverless car because needed you manually drive then you would have have license that you can manually drive there may also need for seperate license have driverless car that you know how react needs manually driven and that they can make sure you are paying attention the road even though you are not driving the biggest reason that think driverless cars should allowed because can reduce the number car wrecks which would lower the number casualties car accidents many people each year get car wrecks and lot people die result those car wrecks company proves that their driverless cars will not get wreck think that many people will buy because the safety that allows the safety driverless cars will the most important factor see they will street legal driverless cars will important part future technology driverless cars are invented and become legal then other companies will also want use that technology make something else perhaps even driverless passenger planes this technology can very useful and will interesting topic listen the future,3
have you ever wanted just out and explore being able see different life would amazing thing see many people want explore many things whether comes with risk not the author the challenge exploring venus believes should study venus despite the dangers snd feel like should even though you don know what going happen feel like you should still take risk and explore but there could also more problems that come along the article the author believes should still and explore venus despite the risk that could encounter the article says these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth astronomers know what the conditions are like venus but still continue want and explore also the article says nasa possible solution hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientist float above the fray they are making solutions where scientists can visit and explore venus without having deal with the extreme conditions the scientists are coming across more challenges than dealing with venus atmosphere the article says however peering venus for ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions because most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere with making solution venus extreme conditions there are now more problems that come across because the solution that protects them from the major conditions conclusion scientist should and study venus disregarding the major conditions these scientist are very careful and aware the risk being venus they came with solution they don have encounter the many harad you should always explore things you want but you should aware risk you know what during the challenge trying explore something new,3
the author claims that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers because venus might once have been like earth and could visited the future the article the author gives information about the planet why scientists want study and possible approaches studying venus paragraph the article says astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth then goes say today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth order study venus nasa coming with ways study venus without risking any lives one such example vehicle that would hover about miles above venus surface another method simplified electronics that have been tested venus like conditions conclusion humans may soon able study venus more closely and maybe one day put humans the evening star yet known when this might happen but with new technology maybe old technology possibility not worth giving,2
reducing the toll the human race with driverless cars the development driverless cars would amazing thing many bad situations could avoided with driverless cars because the human driving car enormous variable the payoff using driverless cars would giant well granted would expensive and the period time would take completely phase out regular cars would lengthy would worthwhile investment into the future the development driverless cars would amazing incredibly helpful step for society and the car manufacturing world every year hundreds thousands people are killed car accidents many those accidents are result negligence the fault the driver driving while under the influence driving and texting driving and making calls driving and eating driving and putting make all are things that cause car accidents that could avoided with driverless cars with driverless cars passengers would able the road and not have deal with the stress that comes with driving around busy roads the stress that comes with taking into consideration bad drivers other people driving under the influence just other drivers general driverless cars would eliminate the biggest variable regarding cars the driver driverless car would beneficial many people but they would even more beneficial the companies and factories that construct and sell the cars they would expensive buy but would pay off themselves every time incident avoided not mention eventually the regular cars would phased out this means that car companies who build and sell the driverless cars would making sensational amount money finding the equipment build all the driverless cars would expensive and time consuming but the process would worth have all the new cars made and the roads driverless cars would change the way the world works there would new driver anxiety when teens get their licenses there would dramatic decrease the death vehicle statistics would not suprising one day people longer needed buy cars similar the article when sergey brian said such cars would change the world there are many options that arise when considering such invention what city decided have fleets taxis and buses with driverless cars driverless cars would added benefit then one would have top buy car and spend the money take car with upkeep and car companies would still make lot money with driverless cars the impact the environment would very much less than those cars today the options and pros are endless when comes driverless cars the world would experience shift function driverless cars were introduced the number deaths and accidents involving automotives would decrease exponentially and life would little less stressful for many the attack the environment would lessened and roads would safer there are pros and cons for any situation but the case driverless cars the pros seem greatly outweigh the cons the quality life would increase and the variable the human driver would eliminated driverless cars would excellent addition the car lots and would amazing tool for people everyday life,4
luke wanted seagoing cowboy cattle boat came and gave him the opportunity the seagoing cowboy program luke friend incited him the cattle boat because his friend knew wanted one luke life changed right after graduation luke did not know his life would change soon was world war was over europe and many counties were left the ruins unrra hired seagoing cowboys take care the horses young cows and mules that worshipped over seas says that luke and don signed crossed the atlantic ocean times and the pacific ocean twice help people affected world war luke also found time board especially return trips after the animals had been unloaded luke said made more aware people other countries and their needs then awareness stayed with him the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games board when luke was there was plenty games they played board helping his aunt katie farm boy had prepared him what the paragraph said what saying when was little then went his aunt katie farm and played around and helped him with his future with animals,1
cars are changing now more than ever before some the changes that cars are going through are good while some them aren good need cars get places the first paragraph says envisions future with public transportation system where fleed driverless cars form public transport taxi system not everyone comfortable with that and not all people want public transportation stayed use what they like being alone and away from all the people will there still cars that aren driverless will the population cars that need driven not exist anymore going against this better hasn being for most people spent lot time and money getting there license and taking classes learn how drive and then that all just gets taken away driverless cars transportation sytems not the best idea that what the driverless items don get used would cost lots money and people would lose there jobs because this like taxi drivers bus drivers and people that teach drivers but good that cars have the traffic jam assistant other things their car that help prevent accidents and other things that sort need things like the traffic jam assistant because helps people out for example paragraph seven says that the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel that means that could save persons life just having sensor your car can help save your life that the kind thing that need cars today instead having driverless cars why don put systems like the traffic jam assistant cars help people out really pointless out your way and spend much money create something that don even know will work yet last what the power went out the city and then the back generator kicked then got shut down the big storm what would happen the people that have get their kids are already out doing things and need get home see their families are okay what you then there are regular cars and the power doesnt work nothing does that why don need driverless cars and transportation systems,4
the author supports this idea because the article gave out specific reasons why studying venus worthy pursuit the article gave out facts about venus one the paragraphs another reason that what would happen venus the future lastly sending humans venus and scientists studying how long they could last here are some reasons why they should suggest that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our sun high pressure and heat venusian geology and the weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes like here earth earth present those here our everyday life venus the planet surface temperature the average over degrees fahrenheit the atmospheric pressure times greater that have experienced earth the past venus was probably covered largely with ocean water and might have could supported various forms life venus still has some feature that are analogous earth venus sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit that means can there for proportional time going venus seems indisputable crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel sending humans venus really risky because jet airplanes travel higher altitude fly over storms vehicle hovering over venus could avoid the ground conditions staying into outer space thirty plus miles about the surface temperature would still hot around degrees they are not easy conditions but the survivable for humans researchers can not take samples rocks gas anything else because the distance scientists seeking conduct through missions understand what venus would get close and personal despite the risks researchers are going work innovations that would allow there machines long enough contribute meaningfully after all these are the reasons why think its good idea suggest that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents think after got the information form the article think they can make machines that can last long for travel venus another reason that can make and possible for get gas and rocks from venus,2
although alot people and states think that driverless cars are bad idea think that they could great addition our lives driverless cars can help when you are busy with your children they are handily when you have much handle and can assist you long trips driverless cars can come handy when you have children driving while you have children can sometimes hasel when you have baby things get harder babies need changed fed and need some attention with the driverless car you can fed change and give your new one some attention little ones are not the only ones that you have worry about sometimes the older ones can big handful kids can get upset angry one another and things that might not acceptable with the driverless care you can talk and help your kids get along cars that drive themselves can great thing when you have busy life all have those days where you have from one place the next pick coffee for the people work drive the kids soccer pratice band rehearsal pick groceries finish your work that you brought home from work help make copies for the kids school play fundraiser just have much your plate for that day think all the things you can while your car driving itself you can finish the work you brought home while the way the kids soccer practice your kids will not upset with you because you dont have the time take them their after school activites because your getting your stuff done the same time that you are the road you know that you hate disappoint your kids and with driverless car you wont have lastly but not certainly not the least the driverless car can assist you those long trips that take the car becasue cant not want spend money plane tickets those vacations that take the car can much easier this car drives its self you dont have worry about you falling asleep the road and having something horrible happen you and your family drivers get tired after few hours non stop driving think all the family bonding moments you and your family can have when you have one less thing worry about think the safty because you arent going fall asleep the road car that drives its self could great addition our lifes can help when you have new born just have kids that are starting learn from right and wrong can great stress reliever when you have much jungle for the day and can make long family trips much easier and fun however for know have drive ourself the destination that desire but hopefully technology will catch and allow acess these wonderfully automobiles,4

the use technology read emotional expressions the classroom valuable maybe paragraph making mona lisa smile nick alto there reason believe that reading the emotions students can help focus what students want what they enjoy the classroom which will ultimately help them learn better they learning what they like artificial emotion reading new technology developed thomas huang the advanced science branch the university illinois and has reached word many schools who are ready fully endorse form reading the emotions students feel help adapt the way they are taught into more fun and interesting way however there one clear down set this idea and thats that kids need facially monitored know they enjoy the class not then probably the teachers fault yes reading emotions would cool feature add know students are enjoying what they are learning but will probably expensive technology purchase further noted also stated making mona lisa smile don completely communicate with each other through words wouldn exactly impossible thing for teachers realize they being boring they pay attention how the students are reacting what they are teaching just seems though unnecessary piece technology that many want entered into the classroom setting all all there are pros and cons moving this piece artificial intelligence into classrooms some pros would the ability know how students are reacting what they are learning and would help focus what motivates kids there school work however few cons would its not cheap and you most likely don need the classroom lastly there could definitely legal trouble with parents not wanting there children monitored throughout the day via their mobile school device artifical emotion reading cool idea but honestly not very practical and not exactly necessary,3
new software has been created determine the facial expressions students uses technology give data what emotions someone feeling such happiness sadness and boredom these technologies are possibly going used classrooms help students learn better based their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning however the use software determine the emotional expressions students the classroom not valuable the students learning experience start order for this new technology work students would have constantly watched cameras that read their expressions this said the text when says using imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements alto one can see from this that the students would always have watched and their facial movements would all recorded this could issue privacy for some students they not want constantly recorded also makes easy for outside threats hack this system and watch students get personal information from the videos emotion recognition software can also expensive for schools especially since doesnt work normal computers the text states your home can handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile alto this shows that normal computers that students would typically use can not support this technology making the school buy the technology that can support this would costly job and the school can not pay for then the students would have and some families may not able afford lastly students facial expressions may not directly correlate with the emotion they are feeling towards the lesson that they are learning this can seen the text when says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor alto this exemplifies that the schools want use this technology help students learn more effectively using technology thats like teacher for some students this may cause trouble they make facial expressions but not about the lesson such student told something another student and the student looks confused the computer might see that and think they dont understand the lesson then would modify the lesson for the student even the student understood just fine teacher would much better understanding the students emotions certain situation than technology students need able learn their own and communicate with teachers how well theyre understanding what theyre learning using facial recognition technology its taking away their communication skills there are many flaws the facial expression technology that make bad candidate use schools its certain that there are plenty good uses for facial expression technology however using schools not one them,5
you and your friends and family could often have arguments whether something real not such movies some might think one thing special effects others will think real unmasking the face mars the author explains controversy the face found mars surface became icon once was released the public was highlighted for decades and the society argued over being alien making just land form called mesa the face was just natural landform and shouldn have been thought alien form the most logical answer this was that was mesa and that the shadows the surface happened make look like human face egyptian pharaoh this struck civilization the late and caused lot arguments the people that thought actually was alien structure were just people the press who just wanted attention mars global surveyor snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all this quotes directly states and gives evidence that just natural landform there isn even any true logical evidence that the face mars was alien artifact was just rumor that went around keep things interesting and intrigue big movie companies the cameras even took picture with ten times better resolution than the picture the face addition the new picture even had each pixel the image span meters comparison the original meters per pixel garvin talks that rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size and that there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were garvin directly states here that matter what the formation couldn have possibly been alien formation even pyramid this even more proof that ridiculous think that the formation was alien making although the face was thought alien there too much evidence that denies and that isn scientists would wish that was extra terrestrial sign but the odds that are too scarce even consider this was very controversial topic have stated before all the theorists out there had many different and unique opinions the narrator says what the image actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin this evidence gives even further support that isn extra terrestrial and states that isn shich exposes that fluke the face mars was ongoing argument for years come once was released the public there was reason there was already valid points that gave proof being just mesa things like this occurence happen all the time even your daily life things like this run across your mind think about the logical way and not very very unlikely path about there may similarities between the sides like this argument but there was too much show that favored the more realistic side the passage has multiple occurences where directly states just that,5
this technology could useful for students classroom reason this technology could helpful because students might get bored classroom this technology could detect that the students are bored with this technology teacher can give them assignment were the students are longer bored this technology can help the learning process because students dont learn when they are unhappy are even angry the facial action coding system would improve test scores learning process and much more the text states how moving you face can improve your emotions according the facial feedback theory emotions moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them student unhappy and the facial action coding system detects teacher can help the student with the problem that making the student unhappy try understand why the student unhappy and just put smile the student face make them happy they can proceed with their work and duties this technology can read the emotions painting then most defiantly can read the emotions human student this technology can the beginning student learning for every student sad happy this technology can really bring out the improvement teachers have been looking for,3
sometimes electoral vote elects the right president sometimes but knowing can have more individual votes than the other canidate and lose that person all because they have more electoral votes sounds wrong election biggest presidencial controversy since gore george bush election wins majority individual votes but bush wins since had majority electoral votes many people beleive the electoral colledge should demolished because the people are supposed vote for the person they want for president not the state the number electoral votes but only needed automatically become the president the problem there are states with and there are states with seems unfair some states because they may small compared some states but isn fair just abolish the electoral colledge gives the people what they want and puts the right president charge its great idea abolish the electoral colledge makes the people happy and make wrong choice its are fault can deal with been through way worse,2

the evening star the author from the challenges exploring venus another name for venus venus known for being inhospitable humans has been subjected debate should send more explorations the planet the author this article thinks the author debates that the value going venus worthy despite the dangers and obstacles face point that the author provides that earth similar venus and that should conduct further studies the planet point that the author makes quite often show that can learn about our planet based off learning from venus today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters exploring venus from this peirce evidence clear that the author trying establish link between earth and venus that venus very similar worth exploring another example the author connecting earth and venus when the author writes about what could been venus long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth exploring venus the writer this story specifically said just like earth because his goal establish the scientific evidence that could gained from going venus because similar earth furthermore the another reason that nasa should send manned mission venus that may the only chance exposition another planet the author provides information how close venus and how this can crucial occasionally the closest distance too earth venus mars our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun different speeds these differences speed mean that sometimes are closer mars and other times venus exploring venus the author provided this information follow with another quote that comes later paragraph the author follows this saying that venus our the closest planet and that going some place closer will lessen space time travel venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit curial consideration given the long time frames space travel exploring venus this crucial have considering that many other planets our very far away making them harder get and making them more expensive missions when venus closer this will increase the support trip evaluate venus because will less expensive and easier get then normal space exploration how finally explore venus its worth the pursuit the author describes this being challenge but one that must overcome explore venus one way that nasa can over come overcome the challenge exploring venus using technology that old bulky but most importantly strong modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick but tend more delicate when comes extreme physical conditions exploring venus this important peirce information the author provides over come the challenge going venus and that can saved technology from the past another way nasa could send astronauts venus through giant blimp the upper atmosphere venus blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roling venusian landscape exploring venus blimp very helpful when comes not burning alive the surface venus because hot but this approach according the author also has some set backs researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance therefore scientist seeking conduct thorough mission understand venus would need get close and personal exploring venus this important know considering that the authors main point that need actually explore venus but this hinders actually which ultimately defeats the whole purpose conclusion venus chaotic and hot place unable support life but the planet also worth exploring the author the challenge exploring venus insist that going venus instead other planets worth because the value going venus worth despite the challenges face going there the author presents this claim explaining that similar earth can learn about our planet well venus also venus close this can save time traveling and that have overcome challenges get their but ultimately worth going,5
cars have been around for awhile now and they seem have developed into our everyday lifestyles but for some countries there such thing having limited car usage can great some cases could really help the enviroment effectively provide less funds for people and even challenge companies pursue bigger idea than just cars our ecosystem angered all the pollution and waste that people put into the air needs stop the idea having limited use cars can provide healthy and great looking earth the article robert duffer paris bans driving due smog see the understanding that paris can help support the idea for having limited usage cars after days near record pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city sentence stated the article paris typically has more smog than other european captial last week paris had micrograms particulate matter per cubic meter compared with brussels and london with nobody driving their cars for day they managed clear alot smog and make the earth look healthy again having the idea for limiting car usage can also have very big impacted people financial funds its common sense not having pay for gas car insurance car payments and even mechanical payments well and having not having pay much those bills can provide person with greater amount cash their pocket but there can down side not having car also cars are made get person from one place another and there isnt any transportation how are you supposed work make some food stops the solution simple ride the bus walk bike get some exercise for once thats the biggest reason why america lazy car complainers such ford dodge toyota all compete with one another but the days studies state that less and less people are buying cars the article the end the car culture elisabeth rosenthal states that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses each year goes this has left researches pondering fundamental question has america passes peak driving answer would simply america has not passed peak driving but how can you car and pay bung bills with money thats question people dream cars everyday wishing they could drive brand new convertible ferrari school but welcome reality were that really doesnt happen and are economy does not help one bit the mobile congress last superar barcelona spain bill ford executive chairman the ford motor company laid out business palan discussing things like trying colab with the telecommunications industry this could and opening for are future could save times around city and ensure that its also safe the same time conclusion the advantages limiting car usage can provide the earth the earth the people and finance nice beautiful and simple but nothing can happen ont act now,3
the facial action coding system facs recent innovation facial recognition software can decipher what peros may feeling analysing muscle movements and facial structure while the technological impact facs revolutionary can sytem like used schools give insight into the emotions student the value facs schools has the potential become great but now facs still has many challenges face order for become practical and valuable part the education sytem currently facs can only recognize six basic emotions happiness suprise anger disgust fear and sadness while this ability great achievement facs would have able read many more expressions such confusion boredom understanding become useful classroom environment implemented its current state facs might look each student face and would able pinpoint only the happy suprised students but typically the happy students are not the ones who need help without the capabilities recognize more emotions facs would serve little purpose this setting the artifical also states that your home can handle the algorithms used decode mona lisa smile many school computers are out date and wouldn able run facs either order correctly use school would have spend large amounts money purchase machines with the computing power run facs investment that may not pay off for years this expense would only made greater the cost the software itself while the facial action coding sytem has the ability become integral part the education sytem with its current capabilities would seem that facs not yet ready assume the role valuable tool classrooms carcross the country,4
the advantages limiting car usage would less pollution less traffic and less money involved for example the german suburbs large garages that are the end development where car owner buys space for along with home cut down cost that germany people have given their cars street parking driveways and home garages are generally forbidden this experimental new district the outskirts freiburg near the french and swiss borders that doesn mean that car ownership not aloud but there only two places park large garages and homes this cuts down money costs for germany long shot because with cars then people don have spend money gas and germany streets will safe without the cars messing the roadies and less car accidents will occur although clitics may say that will difficult for people get around stands that people are just happier this way for example heidrun walter media trainer and mother two says when had car was always tense much happier this way paris they enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city after days near record pollution motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered leave their cars home suffer euro fine same for the odd numbered plates the following day almost drivers were fined which effective way lessen pollution paris since polluted the first place they also said was easier imagine than car free champs elysees doing this got them great results well congestion was down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog which rivaled beijing china for being known one the most polluted cities the world the smog was cleared enough monday for the ruling french party rescind the ban for odd numbered plates tuesday bogota colombia millions colombians hiked biked skated took buses work during car free day which left the colombian streets devoid traffic jams traffic jams are pretty annoying and one wants through them making day like this extremely good for the environment and for your phylicia well people would violate this day they would get charged fines carlos arturo plaza businessman said good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution doing this day would make people more relaxed and happy but also good the enviroment just like germany the end the day important know that all these things these countries are doing are for the good the world good that more mandatory participation then optional objective that people won take global warming seriously even though,4

nick alto article making mona lisa smile describes the capabilities new software called the facial action coding system and provides few examples its possible uses the text the author states that the technology which evaluates the movement facial muscles determine emotion could beneficial places such classroom setting using software such the facial action coding system could valuable classroom setting could improve the quality learning for students the new emotion reading technology could help the classroom could make sure students stayed engaged the lesson often school students become bored easily due lack attention long attention spans uninteresting lessons boring teachers this technology could help eliminate boredom the article huang states that classroom computer could recognize when student bored which would beneficial could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this means that this technology could tell students are bored and could alert the teacher teachers knew when their students were loosing focus and becoming uninterested the lesson they could change bring students back focus which would improve the productivity and use time the classroom because teachers would not wasting time teaching students who are uninterested and therefore likely not listening eliminating this boredom factor teachers would more effective with their teaching time and students would recieve better quality learning the technology could also help improve the quality students learning because can make sure students are not confused often when teachers ask everyone understands the material students who not understand will too embarassed ask for help the teachers with such large class will not notice one only few students are falling behind furthermore the article huang states that most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication meaning that most communication picked other ways such visually unfortunately often classroom setting teachers must face away from their students when writing white board the front the classroom similar situations which means that without the visual connection much the communication between students and teachers lost the new technolgy could help with this problem could identify students emotions even when teacher back turned and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons fit their students needs could also help evaluate emotions that teachers not notice such student confused they may try hide this new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all their students understand the material which would lead improved quality teaching and learning the quality learning classroom setting could improved teachers knowing the emotions their students which would make new technology such the facial action coding system valuable classroom setting this technology would beneficial because could identify whether students are confused bored which would make class time more productive and interesting well make sure all students understood the material this would improve their quality learning and make school more meaningful,5
imagine world where everything you need within walking distance this what our society could become stop relying cars stop using cars could largely cut down greenhouse gasses and polluted air cars means stress dumb drivers dui and car related deaths first stop using cars the main mode transportation buildings would closer homes accomodate people walking them instead driving this saves money because you don need car gas insurance closer and more condensed society means communities could formed where everyone knows everyone like back the old days with city states and villages secondly cutting back cars means cutting back air pollution and greenhouse gasses less greenhouse gasses equals cooler and more healthy earth air pollution big problem places like china france and some european countries get rid most cars the air there will much more pleasant and breathable the sky would also become more clear conclusion cutting back cars could beneficial the whole world communites would formed everything you need would walking distance there would less car related deaths and greenhouse gasses and air pollution would greatly decrease making the earth and its people healthier,3
this essay going talk about the new software that called the facial action coding system which can help the computer knows are sad happy angry putting the example the subject leonardo vinci called mona lisa explain why this software very good idea for the teachers and the students too the software can calculate emotions like math homework just recognizing the subtle facial movements that persons use express how they feel the new software the facial action coding system has promising application for variety industries new software that can recognize emotion and the last innovation from prof thomas huang and his colleague are experts that are trying better ways for human computers communicate this process begins when the computer does model the face creating least major muscles making move like human muscles eckman has classifies six emotions happiness surprise anger disgust fear and saddles associating each with characteristic movements the facial muscles for example your muscles above your eyes rais your eyebrows when you are surprised the software can even identify mixed emotions each expression compared against neutral face big example the subject leonardo vinci mona lisa vinci studied anatomy thep them paint facial muscles for paint special emotions this subject really intented bring smile your face while shows just how this can computer can your can handle the use decode mona lisa smile but this invent can write down simple instructions that encode different emotions for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different this software makes the computer could recognize when student bored confused then could modify the lessons like human great right can indicate the difference between genuine smile and forced one finish with some cientificos conclusions and understand better your boddy according the facial feedback theory emotion moving your facial muscles not ont only express emotions but also may help produce them example when drama coach tells his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning way creating these emotions stage because empath might happen when you see someone else expressions conclusion think this good idea because you can probably know when friend feeling just looking his face imagic that software your computer can know that amazing right also this project helps lot the students when subject hard and they get confused this going help you when you are reading too much then you get bored this software project would act human,3
how could computer seeing one face detect someone emotion and accurate the use the facial action coding system read the emotional expressions students classroom the answer the author uses the picture mona lisa example paragraph one the author states she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry alto par huang explains how the process begins when the computer constructs computer model the face including all the major muscles the model that must move like human muscles the author then states for example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you suprised your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips show anger alto par explain how the different movement your muscles make can show the different emotions the different emotions kids make doing class will precisely accurate however classroom your emotions might vary differently student can look happy one moment and then look bored the next even though they are still happy huang explains how the facial expressions for each emotion are universal meaning they can vary that why using video imagery will capture the mixed emotions paragraph four the author states the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movement real face the painted face mona lisa alto par therefore your emotions are continously changing class this software can detect having this the classrooms will more effective toward the teachers and students the teacher will know when they have modify their lesson when the kids are bored without this teachers about topic without doing something interesting keep the students more alive this software helps the kids because they are bored teacher teaching then what will they learn having this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom both valuable and useful valuable terms that will accurate helping teachers modify their way teaching needed useful terms that will help students more lively the lesson who would think the faces students made class can now detected their own teacher,3
over the past years massive car usage has increased bringing multiple deterrents today fellow citzens should realize the harm the world brought growing car usage the advantages limiting car usage benefit promoting communities that are less dependent cars and can improvement air pollution consequences the advantages begin limiting car usage can have many beneficial effects the worldwide initially the advantages limiting car usage benefit due the fact that communities will less dependent cars source paragraph the author explains example benefit limited car usage stating uneven pitted side walks have been replaced broad smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped this shows how human beings are using cars less walking increasing some health issues creating less traffic accidents and increasing the economy shaoping with the money they have saved from not using cars constantly there are many other benefits such source paragraph proving how parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city this means when the author says bloomed through out the city explains how individuals all ages are starting enjoy the outside activities especially parks and sports centers making over populated with people this gives individuals the advantage out exploring new people and challenges decreasing issues the world such obesity self confidence and healthy status although car usage can necessity while the other hand fact that decreasing car usage can only bring benefits the ones the world shown today this solution could the start numerous amount opportunities that can benefit not only one way but manny moreover the advantages limiting car usage can improvement air pollution consequences the issues harmful gases from cars the run has affected issues and consequences global warming from excessive amounts air pollution source paragraph the author explains advantage less car usage for global warming stating president obama ambitious goals curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions unveiled last week will get fortuitous assist from incipient shift america behavior recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses each year goes this explains how the decrease car usage has protected the ozone layer from harmful gases from car gas fuel and chemicals making the issue global warning benfica rates some points fact using cars may benefit excess for weariness and body pain although worldwide limiting car usage now with these improvements has only benefit for better place breath air that growing being less harmful and cleaner enviroment live decreasing newborn bacteria that can harm improving global warming something all benefit from either now later sum over the past years massive car usage has been deterrent worlwide today there are issues procedings the awareness individuals growing car usage limiting car usage bring advantages such people that can become less deponent cars and decreasing air pollution this issue the matter all,5
lot people probably don think computers being able identify peoples emotions this technology new some people would think super cool and some people would think strange this new technology might useful this technology read emotional expressions students very valuable this new techonology could help detect how student feeling class the computer could detect how they feel scanning their facial expressions for example the text says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored this quote shows that the computer could detect the students emotions and how they are feeling this could help the teacher make the class little bit more exciting this new technology could benefit new ideas this quote also shows the teacher could help the student because they are confused some people might not like express their feelings they might really confused and need help but don want embarassed person could sad and need someone talk but wont speak for example the text says imagine being able detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying hide their emotions this quotes helps support the idea people hiding their feelings and not saying anything this quote shows that this new technology will able detect how someone really feeling their facial expressions even though they aren talking this technology read emotional expressions students very valuable this new technology super beneficial could help classrooms and peoples lives this new technology might the new big thing can very helpful great idea,3

limiting car usage could make americans daily life alot better americans have always relied automobile for there means transportation but limited our automobile use our lfe would get alot better other countries are doing and there getting positive outcomes should follow other countires there car days car ban vauban germany the community completely car free its experimental district that does not allow the ownership car percent familes vauban not own cars percent sold care move vauban heidrun walter said when had car was always tense much happier this way eliminating the use cars this community less stressful traffic and has reduced emmissions americans used bikes walked took the buses our destination pollution and smog would decrease paris partial driving ban was enforced clear the air the global city paris has more smog then any other european capitals after days the car ban the sog cleared imagine did that here the united states pollution would down drastically and stoped driving cars for few days every week there would lesser car accidents every year people would have walk there destination ride bike and people would get exercise from the walking riding the bike would spend less money gasoline diesel americans car use already have starting decrease since the pattern persists will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment many good things come from using cars less and start following the trend our lifes and communities will soon improve,3
the challenges exploring venus how the author suggest that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents comparing venus earth saying venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth what think the author trying say that venus very much like earth even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere why think this detail that supports the claim becuse paragraph the author list all the negatives about venus how the temperature extremly hot and how thick the atmosphere and how the the clouds are filled with highly corrosive acid despite all these things about venus still interesting explore and learn about conclusion our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but shoud expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,2
this article the author uses claims and evidence prove venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers that may come the way starts his article stating the position venus being the second planet from the sun since venus closer the sun this would mean that the venusian landscape dangerously hot having temperatures degrees fahrenheit the article states each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours using this information prove that nasa has attempted explore venusian landscape due the harsh conditions they didn last very long the author refers venus earth twin this because venus has similar density and size venus was also fully covered with large oceans but now have mountains valleys and craters nasa working many different ways approach the harsh lands venus conclusion this article shows the reader that nasa fully determined explore venus out curiousity and they also hope they could discover outbreak the space environment they are striving find something that could change the way our scientists and astronauts look space life,2
people all over the world are saying goodbye their cars and saying hello different old fashioned ways transportation this new trend involves walking bike riding and other types public transportation certain cities like vauban and paris have started set limitations car usage these limitations include days where cars with specific license plates are not allowed drive that day even complete days where driving allowed failure follow these rules results fine most citizens these towns have been following these rules and have found quite rewarding these advantages include stress relief and happier attitude less greenhouse emission into the atmosphere and overall better environment limiting car usage more beneficial than negative one the most beneficial parts not using car often would the loss stress and increase happy attitude most people who have participated the limitation car use have had positive feed back one woman vauban germany where most citizens are giving their cars said when had car was always tense much happier this way said heidrun walter media trainer and mother two she walked verdant streets where the swish bicycles and the chatter wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor rosenthal another man bogota colombia participating their car free day said good opportunity take away stress said businessman carlos arturo plaza rode two seat bicycle with his wife selsky all around people who have joined this trend have started become happier and less stressed the start leave their cars behind another advantage limiting car usage would less greenhouse emission into the atmosphere cars play huge part greenhouse emission into the atmosphere limiting the usage would have such positive result according the the article german suburb life goes without cars passenger cars are responsible for percent the greenhouse gas emissions europe and percent some car intensive ares the united states rosenthal knowing that cutting out cars would minimize the greenhouse gas emission huge percent certain regions like the united states the article the end car culture discusses how the amount people who own cars keeps getting progressively lower each year which will help with greenhouse emission after discussing statistics the amount people who own cars america the article gonese say this pattern persists and many sociologists believe will will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation the second largest souse america emissions rosenthal with limiting the amount car usage the atmosphere will exposed lot less greenhouse emission one huge advantage limiting the usage cars would overall better environment many cities are polluted and have air filled with smog like beijing and paris some this smog comes from cars paris doing something stop their smog from becoming any worse they are banning driving monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered leave their cars home suffer euro fine the same would apply odd numbered plates the following day duffer similar situation happening bogota columbia bogota started car free day help with their situation the goal promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators faced fines selsky these new limitations car usage are going help save the environment overall the limitations that are being put car usage have many advantages the lack car usage certain areas helping create better environment give out less greenhouse emission and give people happy attitude putting limitations car usage has benefited many areas and continues benefit them now most these places are continuing progress and put more limitations cars they head into nicer brighter future,4
the future very strange place this article talks about having driverless cars the future also this article reads about the advantages and disadvantages these driverless cars for instance these cars shall save you from buy new car when your old one breaks down driverless car seems like something nice have which having driverless car can bring lots easiness into your life these smartcards can detect when theses dangers ahead these cars there are sensors that have become way more advanced over the years these sensors can cause the car apply brakes the wheels reduce power its allowing the human better response and more control than human could manang they may driverless cars but there still needs human inside stay alert they can ready take control when problem occurs also the driver not paying attention the car will immediately notify the driver the seats will vibrate theres danger ahead athough there are laws saying that human driver must engaged all times most states illegal test computer driven cars,2
fellow citizens should know the advantages limiting their car usage driving less car can reduce the pollution for example the article german suburb life goes without cars says expert says its huge impediment currently efforts drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes cars are responsible for greenhouse gas emission thats why its important cut back not they could ban driving for example the article paris bans driving due smog paris almost near the record pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city and there was article about car free day spinning into big hit bogota talks about banning cars and only transportation bike walk and busses the article german suburb life goes without cars people who ownes house has pay for parking space stated car ownership allowed but they must buy parking spaces which can cost cause this people who dont have money rather buy house instead car they dont have pay for parking space vauban families not own cars and sold car move germany paris bans driving due smog paris bans driving becuase after days near record pollution which made praise enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city motorists with even numbered license plates were order leave their cars home suffer euro fine which usd and some drivers dont even enforced the rule for example drivers were fined for not cooperating with the rule enforced paris offical diesel fuel was the blamed since france car which made cars fueled with diesels its good idea for paris ban driving for certain amount days because can clear the air with pollutions car free day spinning into big hit bogota they have banned driving for straight years the only transportation you could get around buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars the capital city population million people who violate the banned driving could faced fines the turn out was large despite gray clouds thay dumped rains showers bogota the mayor says its good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution this case agree with the mayor because having stree free pollution can lead healthier state and clean enviroment the end car culture president obama ambitious goals curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions many sociologists believe will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environments since transporation the largest source american emission for example companys like ford and mercedes have been rebranding themselves mobility companies with all these changes people who stopped car commuting result the recession may find less reason resume the habits company who offer transportation for example new york theres new bike sharing program reduce car transportation fellow citizens its good idea cut back and save money and pollution our planet earth everyone wants clean and safe enviroment one thing you dont want your country ban limited driving which makes you take the city bus call taxi,3

the face mars has since become pop icon nasa discovered the face mars when they took picture some people believe that the face real and some don although might look real just messa far they only have older pictures they also have confimed messa which common mars cheif scientist for nasa said reminded him middle butte snake river plain idaho therefore the face was real then why haven gotten more pictures contrast they only have older pictures very few scientist believed the face was alien artifact scientists figured was just another martian messa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh however people thought was real face when the picture went online people thought was bona fide evidence life mars even though some people are defenders nasa still shouldn give them money see there actual ancient civilization could possibly putting that money waste should think about the pictures are real they were photoshopped however nasa has confirmed messa which natural landform since windy cloudy mars this messa could have been pushed around make look like face even though got pictures would still able see things like airplanes egyptian style pyramids even small shacks could have actually seen those the ground nasa dosen even pass over the face that often contrast would not able get much information should not even worry about how figure out what therefore when scientists jim garvin says reminds him middle butte the snake river plain idaho should think about how right when scientists says something big and important are listening and comparing something earth mars means that could have been caused erosion even though are just getting pictures isn enough could have better pictures now then they did back then conclusion erosion and plains earth come naturally have idea what that could made could made sand for all now therefore may have confirmed pictures face but have pictures that not just darker sand the face could anything mars because their pictures confirmed messa natural landform contrast formed naturally just like how looks like middle butte idaho which was formed naturally this gets people saying that their could life mars probably would have found now all all the face was real then why don have more advanced pictures nasa only has older pictures this called face looks like natural landform idaho next time nasa gets people crazy about another ancient alien civilization think about how they need prove,4
dear senator believe that america should keep the electoral college elect the president the united states believe this because the electoral college makes guaranteed outcome gives proper representation big states and the president has have trans regional appeal the electoral college has more certainty outcome for election for example the election obama received percent the electoral votes very convincing number but only the popular vote not convincing the electoral college also avoids the problem tie the votes even though the electoral college has votes which would make possible for tie very unlikely that there tie the electoral college for example richard nixon only received the popular votes but won the electoral college bill clinton had only the popular vote but also won the pressure run off election reduced with the electoral college the electoral college gives the big states more representation than the smaller states for example florida has electoral votes while state like maine only has the popular vote was really close florida but obama won and got electoral votes the same thing happened maine the winner would only receive electoral votes america used the popular vote decide who won the win few votes would mean almost nothing and the big states would have the same representation the small states the president can win the election just winning one region states the electoral college has made that the candidate would have have trans regional appeal this desirable for most people because president that only popular one region and not everywhere will not good president this why candidates don campaign places that they know they will win and branch out the swing states these swing states basically decide the election they are the states that not favor either the democratic republican candidate they have important votes swing states one way will the election this why many candidates campaign these swing states you can see senator the electoral college the best way for electing new president has more certain and guaranteed outcome than the popular vote gives more representation the bigger states and requires appeal from people all over america not just people one region,4
teaching classroom setting something that has been happening sucessfully for centuries now dating way way back before technology was even being thought about this goes show technolgy not needed but maybe sometimes helpful classroom setting peces technology such has things like computers can super helpful when doing things such writing essay and accessing information online however when taken too advance can become more joke and distraction students that where the facial action coding system comes into play the facial action coding system theoretically seems good idea but reality expensive toy there are many other proven effective ways teach classroom and somethings are boring learn about but you still have know them just sit still relax and learn the first thing you notice when walking into classroom usually the students who are choosing not spend their time wisely rather than the students who are this because students who choose off task are often distracted technolgy and gaming which lot more noticable the human eye these students are taking advantage technology provided and using for bad why would put the facial action coding system schools when expensive and would used toy that right wouldnt when used for other purposes also risk crashing which another thing that would take more time rather than taking that time for the students taught everybody learns different ways for example take the idea studying for spelling test some kids learn writing down multiple times some kids learn hearing being spelled others learn best repeating there are many way for kids learn adding the facial action coding system into schools you assessing kids how much they enjoy what they are learning about and not how much information they are actually gaining which bring next point not every kid going excited about everything they learn yes some books are boring and who wants learn about what cells are made and who cares who invented the lightbulb but these are all things kids are going learn anyways not everything going fun sometimes you just need the facts making kids excited about topic all comes from the influences other people being excited about topic and feeling that positive energy around them computer screen told you you were bored wouldn make you less bored the facial action coding system not all bad there are some good parts about the paysage the author talks about how classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored recognize when student confused powerful thing because when more students are confused they don always like say however the facial action coding system expensive way tell student confused child confused they should say something this allows students build self confidence all all the facial action coding system has both pros and cons however the cons over power the pros making this tool not valuable classroom setting expensive toy that should used for other purposes not say there good uses for the facial action coding system but just not valuable classroom setting,5

becoming seagoing cowboy has lot ups and downs but the ups are actually pretty cool like you might find uncharted island and make lot money off you would see interesting and cool places while you were traveling the destination have always wanted ireland but dont think that will ever there unless become seagoing cowboy corse you get lot excercise traveling lot you are the kind person who really likes travel then you would like seagoing cowboy you get chance boat the open sea would really like seagoing cowboy because your always out sea and love the ocean could live the ocean could you would try new things the the way like you would land countries islands that you have always wanted you might also get respect from the other langers mean who wouldn like have respect from other people plus you get awesome name seagoing cowboy sounds cool huh yeah try might your kind thing maybe you could just sit around home doing dishes chopping logs something who knows maybe you will become seagoing cowboy one day,2
this article the author makes sure provide all the facts but ultimately the good outweighs the bad venus challenging planet for humans study thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus has clouds highly corrosive sulfuric alcide its atmosphere its temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit has the hottest surface temperature out all the planets its atmospheric pressure times greater than earth venus wasnt always inhospitable scientists say was probably just like earth venus still has some features analogous earth the value returning venus seems indisputable but don really have options for making such mission both safe and scientifically productive recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel the author makes sure include couple solutions the problem one solution would allow scientists float above the fray vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions they would have solar power and radiation would not exceed earth levels would survivable for humans the downside that researchers wouldn able take samples rock gas and anything from distance electronics made from silicon carbide have been tested lastly the author states that our travels earth should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,2
the article driverless cars are coming the author presents both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars against the development driverless cars because they can cause debate when comes whos fault can also take away the fun driving they are also not very productive and can really expensive just the idea having driverless cars seem futuristic and perhaps awesome but are thay really safe and actually productive the article the author gave many negative aspects driverless cars because they can always occur other words future cars are not safe and possibly productive they seem one the big issues driverless cars who will held responsible for the accidents that occur the companies that produce the cars will probably not want take responsibility for the accident and what the driver does not want either the author said still even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident the company will lose millions dollars and just because one accident other senderos the driver held responsible for the accident would cost them lots money well who exactly would held accountable for the accident its driverless car another reason why against the development driverless cars because they take away the fun driving like the author said paragraph eight wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive staying inside car boring and its much more boring doing nothing all would the driver lose interest and depend the car everything when really the car also needs actually driver this can cause safety issues what the driver does not notice the car need assistance because they are their phone electronic device driverless cars can also really expensive and less productive then the companies say they are the article talks about how they combined many form technology finally get almost finish product says paragraph four the most important bit technology this system the spinning sensor the roof dubbed lidar uses laser beams form constantly updating model the car surroundings the combination all this input necessary for the driverless car mimic the skill human the wheel could this mean that the car will really expansive most forms technology are really expensive and this driverless car will contain several pieces technology just mimic the skill human the wheel also says that the car will only mimic driver but what will when comes very complex things such accidents taking much more difficult route for these reason against the development driverless cars driverless cars can cause debate take the fun out codriving and finally they can really expensive and not very productive they will cause more problems then they solve and are really expensive although driverless car sound really nice its too advanced for this time era,4
have you ever thought about how the world would our cars drive for inventors are trying make that happen but driverless cars come with lot aprons and cons can good thing but also very bad thing some situations driverless cars can help lot such person doesnt have legs but still want get around and doesnt always want wait someone come get them driverless help they can start move around there own more often another reason can help takes half the fuel does than the cars have now also its more flexibility than bus you dont have worry about missing the bus loosing you bus pass you just have get your own car and and come you please the driverless car can more than half million miles with crash and the car alerts you when its needed during heavy traffic pulling our drive ways and going reverse and navigating through roadwork accidents driverless cars also has its cons and could hurt humans when the driverless car alerts the person take over what they cant what the person doesnt has legs take over the car what are the supposed laws are written with the assumption that onlys car has human driver control all times technology messes all the time and that can occur during person driving and can cause them injured death the technology fails and someone injured who fault driver the manufactuers sometimes its hard debat that question which another reason why its hard pass the law for driverless cars driverless cars are going make people think thats its okay text while the car driving which takes there attention off the car and could their time take over they wouldn know because they are texting also with the driverless car gives people much freedom the car such move around more look back and make everything but pay attention position that should keep cars how they are now feel that made this far with driving for ourselves our riding the bus why cant just contine driverless cars are dangerous and just waste person doesnt want drive than they have the option riding the bus riding taxi feel that driverless cars going make the work even more lazy than already are being told have you took deep thought until how the world would with driverless cars driverless cars could big help lot ways driverless cars can hurt lot ways,4

the invention driverless cars has many intriguing ideas clouding the reduction the use gas sensors alert the driver when take over the wheel and new entertainment system but without driver control the vehicle driverless car may somehow malfunction and out control causing danger the driver passengers and other people the road also without ability drive drivers will feel very bored because they would have nothing therefore believe that driverless cars should not made because the safety hazards that could cause and because the lack entertainment value driverless cars should not created for two main reasons first without the attention the called driver the car may suddenly break down causing accidents and injuries pedestrians passengers the car though cars like the bmw stated this article have special touch sensors the driver who may not paying attention the road might not have time react the situation with driverless cars the driver may underestimate what could happen the car suddenly malfunctioned therefore driverless cars should not created driverless cars would not keep the driver aware his surroundings the driver would basically another passenger the car result people the car might start get very bored long trips like traveling down florida driver would not get bored because the new roads would keep his her eyes occupied the road and the driver would get drive unfamiliar roads making the drive little less boring for the drivers but without the ability drive there would nothing these long trips this article even admits that the psychological aspects self driving cars are challenge becuase the driver might insane just sitting car for prolonged period time result driverless cars should not created driverless cars should not mad because the psychological effects person and safety hazards that could cause without the attention driver the car could out control without the driver even noticing driver would also very bored just sitting car for long period time and therefore she would not like these kinds cars should stick with non autonomous cars because the keep the attention the driver the road and provides least some entertainment value for the driver,4
how humans can travel venus venus commonly known earth twin the closest planet have almost the same size and density earth when people first hear this their minds quickly wonder humans could ever live venus any time nasa conducted experiment for venus they have always sent unmanned spacecraft and for good reason each time the spacecraft landed was close the planet would last more than three hours what does this mean for humans the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents introducing venus features nasa and technology astronomers fight the question why they keep studding venus providing the information they have found venus discovered planet that used have many earth like features furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long frames space travel the challenge exploring venus the author explains that venus the nearest option for humans visit because how close the orbit scientists conclude that venus might have had large bodies water and could have supported other life forms like earth venus also has features earth has like mountains craters and valleys since venus already planet with very similar structures like earth makes scientists think whether not take little visit venus according scientific research venus temperature can degrees fahrenheit which times greater that what humans experience earth although the temperature venus can bizarre numbers nasa still comes through with idea how send humans venus just our jet airplanes travel higher altitude fly over many storms vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way the challenge exploring venus nasa concludes that humans are venus they would have blimp like vessel and about the ground resist the scorching temperatures the temperature woul still high degree almost about degrees fahrenheit but humans could still live and function that rate the air pressure would close that earth sea level which survivable for humans nasa idea blimp like vehicle allows humans start journey venus the technology made makes the trip venus possible for humans the near future technology the past has been able make close venus without humans but would always destroyed less that three hours nasa and their scientists work everyday with technology make anyway easier travel venus despite the dangerous temperature zones the chances destruction the planet impediments and the very high pressure technology can make easier adventure venus for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions the challenge exploring venus nasa has been already testing products with their technology see would comparable with venus climate and the product has been able adapt the climate for three weeks this means that nasa starts get the right technology for venus travel there wouldn dangerous they thought venus features nasa and technology all support the author statement why venus worthy pursuit despite all the dangers since venus and earth share similar features scientists found that venus also might have had large bodies water which may also bring other similarities earth nasa has been studying and making plans about how humans will able travel the constant hot temperatures and climate venus and found way for humans travel technology has made easier withstand venus features and made ways for humans able adapt with all these changes makes easier let humans hop board and travel venus despite all dangerous remarks about the planet,5

there are many advantages limiting car usage for example passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states another example that all around the world there are attempts make suburbs and community more compact and more accessible public transportation with less parking spaces this new approach which stores are placed walk away main street not like malls who usually are along some distant highway vauban percent vauban families not own cars and percent sold car move here the united states the environmental protection agency promoting car reduced communities like vauban paris after near record pollution they enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city monday even numbered license plates were ordered leave there cars home the would have pay they did the same for the odd numbered plates the following day almost people were fined one good thing though that congestion was down percent the capital france after days intensifying smog paris typically has more smog than other european capitals bogota colombia millions colombians hiked biked skated took buses work during car free day the goal was promote alternative transportation and reduce smog carlos arturo plaza businessman said was good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution was riding two seat bike with his wife the united states recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses each year goes this has left researchers pondering fundamental question has america passed peak driving when adjusted for population growth the number miles driven the united states peaked and dropped steadily thereafter according analysis dough short advisor perspectives investment company sociology professor drexel university and director its mobilities research and policy center mimi sheller said that different things are converging which suggests that are witnessing long term cultural shift she says allows people feel more connected without driving meet people demographic shifts the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate spivak research has found that there has been large drop the percentage year olds getting license while older people are likely retain their licenses they age study found that driving young age decreased percent between and you can tell the advantages limiting car usage are that helps clear the air reduce smog and take stress away also lowers air pollution and helps with making the greenhouse gas emissions europe down another thing that great way promote alternative transportation these are some the many advantages limiting car usage,2
the article the challenge exploring venus has very excellent claim about studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers paragraph the author says often referred earths twin out all the planets venus the closet earth terms density size and occasionally distance too its saying that each previous mission was unnamed and for good reason they thinking that since spacecraft has survived the landing for more than few hours maybe its becoming issue not single spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades the author explains that the atmosphere thick and almost percent carbon dioxide the average temperatures average over degress which something people need know anyone wanting venus because that temperature could harm you very easily the high pressure and heat can cause erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes the land surface national aeronautics and space administration has one particuarly compelling idea for humanas studding venus the hostile conditons the surface venus would allow scientist float about fray there jet air ancestral higher altitude fly over many storms temperatures would still toasty like degress but the air pressure would close sea level think that this aurthur did fantastic job explain the venues worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents know now that would not want venus see what its like,3
the future the present what seemed like mere dreaming now coming life new techology has helped with many advances today for example smart cars this concept fairly new but has already sprouted problems these dilemmas are complex therefore the world still not ready for driverless cars throughout the years many companies have tried make this new idea happen yet new concept for example the late general motors created concept car that could run special test track these smart road systems worked surprisingly well but they required massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply too expensive practical this shows that driverless cars are not smart idea now days people want something practical and fast smart road systems are nether practical quick because would expensive and would take time for the roads upgraded once they saw the expensive would take they let the idea after this idea smart roads epically failed other came with the idea smart cars even though smart cars have been effective they are still not able drive themselves they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents smart cars have programs assists the driver not drive themselves humans will still have alert the road will not going help the driver what the use cars that can drive themselves when the driving conditions get tough humans will needed another important issue these driverless cars come out who will blame for accident happens the driver the company because the person the car will assisting the car the car should blame for since the smart cars are made drive themselves then all people involved the accident would victims due the information safe say that driverless cars are yet merged into today life the people today spend most their day doing something opinion they are ready nothing one going enjoy this break though maybe not becasue though they are just passagers the car might need assists therefore there need for cars that will get only part the job done,3
personally believe that driverless cars are good idea and can very useful there are also some major points that are needed pointed out before person purchases drives one these cars can see people taking advantage these technologies and abusing the things the car may provide the buyer should always take into consideration that these car could malfunction and aware that these cars are not always going reliable the driver were carless and text and drive the car could possibly malfunction and you could putting your life someone else life risk manufactories are coming with new techniques help alert the driver any danger that could possibly occur before the incident could even happen vibrating seats are providing the driver enough time stop the car when about run into another object flashing lights the dash board are used alert the driver the car thinks they are being distracted from the road these cars the manufactories are installing video cameras watch the driver inside that car and watch for any danger the driver might encounter outside the car gps are installed monitor where the car case crash the driver lost the road the driver can use find there destination motion sensors are being put into cars help the driver drive safely the motion sensors help the driver know how far away they are from hitting another car even person they are also used apply brakes when the car coming close another object they are hoping soon put display where the driverless car system can shut off when the driver wants control the car read the positive and negative factors binary code they functioned surprisingly well but make the massive upgrades needed would far expensive for them even make practical the main focus that these manufactories have keep everyone the roads safe take this into consideration these cars could possibly change the human way driving each and everyday new technologies are being discovered and giving humans another reason become more lazy these developments will eventually come into good use when the time comes but that the people using them will have enough common sense understand they can not abuse the advantages these cars provide and they could lead into bigger consequences,3
think that would useful classroom because sometimes the teacher cant always read the students facial expressions and will keep teaching the same boring class but used the new technology that could read the kids faces and change the course the class make more interesting then more kids wouldn bored all the time and they will able learn more about the subject that they are learning about the new technology could also save more money not having have alot teachers the classrooms and they could use for food newer technology and maybe better building also kids might not like some the teachers that are the classrooms and the teachers might not like the kids that are their either with the new technolgy replacing teacher would save them arguments with the kids and teachers that why think that should emplacement this new technology into our school systems,2
the main advantages limiting car usage would less accidents and less pollution people dont really know about how many accidents and how much pollution cars are responsible for start off with cars can make you very tense and then possibly resulting crash without cars people would less tense and calm every day they work for example heidrun walter said when had car was always tense much happier this way the outskirts freiburg street parking drive ways and home garages are generally forbidden their streets are completely car free except for the main thoroughfare freiburg does allow car ownership but there are only two places park large garages the edge the development where car owner buys space for along with home result the people not own cars and sold car able live there people now walk take the tram ride bicycles school and work and yet these people are very happy about planes are now taking this concept the suburbs they are doing this putting new building walking distance from those people winsted the malls were people have drive order get there addition people being less tense banning cars would result less pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city after five days smog rivaled china which one the most polluted cities the world diesels were the blame but finally monday the smog cleared enough for the ruling french party rescind the ban for odd numbered plates tusday this ban also went colombia for three years they have been doing this and they only allow buses and taxies everyone else gets fine eventually two other colombian cities cali and valledupar joined the event kids now are not even wanting get drivers license they would rather walk these kids get their jobs looking the ones that are walking distance this very good thing because the less drivers the less pollution there the air conclusion limited the usage cars people would more relaxed and there would less pollution the air pluss people would gatting exercise people would benefit from this and our world would much cleaner,2
official the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational three reasons right there why should switch over election popular vote unfair outdated and irrational let help you better understand the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states stated what wrong with the electoral college source the electoral college also unfair because there always one person this case candidates trying harder than the other person also stated source during the campaign seventeen states didn see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didn get see single campaign which completely unfair foolish even way past outdated decades ago there reason why still actually have this around many people stopped voting maybe not because how old this act but defiantly because need new way election popular vote could one those new ways this electoral college has have exasperation date someday irrational irrational because doesn make sense you think about basically easy way get out cheating and one likes cheaters were change the election popular vote think about how much more worth would think about how there wouldn many problems people voted for the right candidate what they actually won what about all the world changes just makes more sense more reasonable there could many things different today changed the way election worked years ago never too late still have time time stop the unfair outdated and irrational ways all you need little motivation,3
the author did alright supporting his idea studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers there are some things that the author explained well and others where didn defend his case when reading this will seem questionable this something off when the author was explaining his thought this made convincing argument told some similarity between venus and earth often referred earths twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too venus and earth are very alike terms apperance the author uses point that venis close earth that makes easier travel there these differences speed mean that sometimes are closer mars and other times venus being closer venus would make the trip there easier then most other planets there are also some things this topic that the author doesn into tells you that dangerous the planet the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet this tells you not safe venus but study better would need get there know what like there and don know how get there alive why would studying venus worthy the atmosphere dangerous thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere doesn seem that worthy exploring you can even survive venus there are good reasons and bad reasons for studying venus overall the author did job supporting his idea,3
wouldn cool able relax while driving personally driver myself know that driving for long periods time can very tiring your feet get tired and your legs become reassess you were able just sit back and relax while the car was being driven and you only had attentive when problem occured that experience that you would want partake believe that driverless cars could very convenient for drivers and think that they should put use they would become very popular because says paragraph two television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves many people would want own one for themselves and able get the experience everyone would know about because the media would make very well known and the companies that would selling the driverless cars would make lots profit many people might say that dangerous and could cause tragic car accident but paragraph seven states fact none the cars developed far are completely driverless they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents with this being said drivers must attentive and remain alert and ready take over when problem like this was accu another point that may brought discussion what the driver attention not able grabbed when the car need the driver assistance well paragraph seven says that has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over other options under consideration are flashing lights the windshield and other heads displays these are all things that could put place ensure that the car able quickly get the driver attention personally believe that the driverless car would great help every person driving they would able relax more and they would not have take manyas stop breaks between round trips the driver could simply more ease while driving and not have cautious the driverless car would more safe for people inside the car and outside the car such pedestrians the driverless car great idea,4
the electoral college process established the constitution compromise between election the president popular vote qualified citizens the electoral college process consists the selection the electors the meeting the electors where they vote for president vice president the counting electoral votes congress their are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack impressive democratic origin history all are practical reasons not liberal conservative reasons our country would much better off kept the electoral college rather than choosing the president just based the popular vote the electoral college widely regarded anachronism non democratic method choosing president that ought overruled declaring the candidate who recieve the most popular votes the winner the advocates this position are correct arguing that the electoral college methodist not democratic modern sense the electors who elect the president not the people when you vote for presidential candidate youre actually voting for slate electors the electoral college consists electors majority electoral votes required elect the president your states entitled allotment electors equals the number its congressional delegation one for each member the house representatives plus for each senator each candidate running for president your state has his her own group electors the electors are generally chosen the candidates political party but state laws vary how the electors are selected what their responsibilities are the electoral college good because restores some the weight the political balance that large states lose virtue the mal apportionment the senate decreed constitution the electoral college also avoids the problem elections which candidate recieve majority the votes cast the winner take all method awarding electoral votes induces the candidates focus their campaign efforts the toss states votes the toss states are more likely pay attention the campaign really listen the competing candidates knowing that they are going decide the election each party selects slate electors trusted vote for each party nominee however entirely possible that the winner the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote yet that has happened when gorge had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes but that was the first time since can argued that the electoral college method selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has intention hope carrying their state democrats texas for example republicans california knowing their vote will have effect they have less incentive pay attention the campaign thn they would have the president were picked popular vote but course voter vote swings national election and spite that about the eligible american population did vote election voters presidential elections are people who want express political preference rather than people who think single vote may decide entire election,3
has someone ever told you that the face mars was real but you knew wasn the face mars natural landform called mesa but people mistake for face because the shadows formed the face mars natural landform because research with space crafts and the study pictures over time the face mars natural landform because research with spacecrafts research with space crafts has shown that the face mars just landform many people thought the face was alien artifact when appeared many books hollywood film magazines radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines people still may not believe but there more say the face mars just mesa because pictures shown overtime the pictures between through show the face fading away they show the face was nothing other than moutain like landform the pictures were taken with high tech gear that they had back then they were taken when spacecraft viking was looking for another spacecraft viking was snapping pictures and got the face later nasa found out was just mesa conclusion people still may believe that the face mars was real but studies show that was just landform the face mars just landform because research with spacecrafts and and the study the pictures over time final thoughts this that the face was cool until saw that was just mesa was cool learn about this but was just goofy looking mountain,2
the future cars are coming use they are the driverless cars driverless cars are good thing they will help people who can dive will others lot people oppose driverless cars for one particular reason these cars will save people lives when that are the roads people think the cars will not save people but kill them cars have all the same saftey features normal care and more these automobiles have many bores such dubbed lidar that use laser beam form constantly updating model the car surrounding this will see thing that the diver would not see when driving help the car stop for thing fount the car see car coming you and more you the side the road not get into ascendent also this car will save the owner money the car and get you places better them public transportion these cars are made from hybrid car they will same gas with will save you move ans some are going electronic cars sergey brin google founder believer one day the never future will have fleets driverless taxis the will pick you your house and take you anywhere this taxis would use less gas then public buses not and taxis wirich will save money the only problem about the cars one question the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer with this one question there are only four place the united state were you can use driverless cars the manufacturer should the one fault they should have tensed every system the cae before sent the owner but also their should law stating that you own driverless car you need get all the secor the car cheeked profissional every months conclusion driverless cars will help the economy and also save peoples lives people should not think they are bad thing yes they need tested more but people should want change that will help people out,3
google has had cars that could drive independently since under certain conditions driverless cars would have huge impact our world today with both positive and negative affect google cofounder sterger brin belives that the future driverless cars form future public taxi system this would have postive affect because the cars would half the fuel todays taxi and would more flexible than bus driverless cars are coming soon and has been used before these will soon able help and change the world they will soon change the way look cars today google cars have been known drive more than half million miles without crash this showest that they are safe but arent completely driverless the use driverless cars benefits use because they arent driverless certain conditions these are arent driverless and require the use the driver conditions like pulling and out driveways getting through complicated traffic issue and getting through road work this will have negative affect because they should able work under all condition driving driverless cars can have negative aspect and positive aspect the driving laws negative way these cars cant function certain areas and this can disrupt driving also illegal even test computer driven cars most states and postive way these are allowed tested most states and upgraded the point the driver can receive alters notify them things tela has projected the use computer driven car with percent autopilot driving system used most the time other cars like mercedes benz audi and nissan have paned relased the version computer driven car these cars ere soon reales and they will help with many driving difficulties that encounter today this will have positive outcome our world,3

the mystery the unmasking face mars the article unmasking the face mars people think that the face was created aliens this essay will tell you the face was created aliens was just natural landform why would people think this face was created aliens was just natural landform what would you think about the face being created aliens now that got that out the way why would people think that the face was created aliens there was not much evidence that the aliens were the ones that created the face people can not just around saying that aliens caused the face happen because there was very little proof that caused aliens garvin also said reminds him middle buttle the snake river plain idaho paragraph and paragraph also says that there was alien momentum after all also some people think that the face just natural landform think that the face was caused why natural landform because found more information that the face was caused natural landform like paragraph michael malin and his mars orbiter camera moc team took photo and when the image first appeared jpl web site revealed that was natural landform think that the face was really created aliens there would have been more evidence proof saying that aliens had created the face because there was more proof saying that the face was created natural landform there was more proof about the face being created aliens than just being natural landform then not sure what would have done last all found out that there was more proof the face being created natural landform than the face being created aliens there was more people talking about how was not created aliens and there was also people saying that there was proof saying that the face was created aliens but would have say will stick with there being more proof about the face being created natural planform,3
not see place for self driving cars our time but may see place for them the future although there are many advantages these google self driving cars there are also some things that take away from self driving feature google may have found new mode transportation but for the here and now believe taxi are for here stay these are self driving cars why must the driver rider still fully aware the surrounding objects and traffic they had state this why should this allowed the streets all this great idea and claims helping our enviroment using half the fuel the taxi use would huge technological impact our entire species carbon footprint our planet but also what google should deam the most important features this product saftey passengers and the vehicles surrounding although agree with amn this great idea and could take over the taxi cab industry total feel this may for the years down the road google shoud wait ten fifteen years order perfect the technology order get this self driving car the roads but until then feel still time for the classic yellow taxi continue being driven human behind the wheel our cities,2
believe that this not valuable for students classroom sure could help them make those faces more but doesnt have much use other than that not like helps lose weight improves health just shows emotions especially school setting most students express their emotions freely anyways there may some cases students hiding emotions but for the most part they tend very expressive first many students may not realize how much they show their emotions already but generally they are incredibly easy read this technology would not that usefully becuase that would only help very select cases also some people would twan their emotions scanned computer they may going through hard time and want keep that personal possible second could invading someones private life this mean some people hate when everything know about them for example people who put tape over their computers because they are worried about the fbi watching them think that becasue people like that would not very accepted into schools without forcing onto students also not think the students really care about expressing their emptions computer third although could used detect emotions items history would not have place schools invasion privacy and would very prying into students personal life conclusion not hinky this technology will very well accepted into schools think will have forced onto the students whch would just cause more problems from parents and students although does have some used they are situational not think that amazing discovery,3
earth twin kind hot venus earth twin but far much more hot than earth itself whole lot more closer the sun than earth and that make space travel get venus harder there could many pros and cons venus there are also many dangers going vetus study the atmosphere far one the biggest reasons not there with nasa new and improved technology space travel there could lot safer than how now the author does good job depicting the struggles space travel venus venus the same size earth and that could good could bad life could possible because almost the goldilocks zone but scientists would have find way help with the heat has rocky surface just like venus and there evidence that was possibly covered water one point the planet one earth best choices survival since venus almost the same size earth should safe travel there the atmosphere venus far one the biggest risks when attempting visit this planet the atmosphere made carbon dioxide which would kill you within minutes the air the planet too thick even breathe all the carbon dioxide didn kill you then you would die suffocation the atmosphere very hot and scientists say that the ground reaches temperatures degrees farenheit the atmosphere venus the biggest problem when trying visit the planet the technology that nasa has developed over the years astonishing they have developed jet airplanes that can take you outerspace insane speeds and they have also reduced the time that takes get there even good old spaceship will the trick but the space company has made some serious upgrades them over the years they have even tried make shuttles made silicon carbide which can help item withstand the heat that brought upon venus earth twin doesn seem fun now the uther does great job depicting the struggles space travel venus although almost the same size earth still very dangerous approach the planet the atmosphere makes almost unreachable since hot and thick but the technology that nasa has developed would doubt increase the chances surviving the travel venus,5

the use this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable because being able detect the students emotions can very beneficial many instructors and teachers different ways will efficient because will let the teachers know what the students are interested what they like instead trying figure out their own also the students will able get better understanding what they like during school and what helps them learn classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored according huang this could help the teachers and instructors know they need change anything about the way they are making the students learn for example shows the student being bored they could activity that more interactive and involved rather than just sitting there and doing worksheet also they seem confused gives you opportunity help that individual one one you are able their pace and patient with them they can learn their own way overall this technology could very beneficial and efficient the school environment going help teachers gather knowledge about their teaching styles and they need change any thing about the way they are making students learn also this helping students realize the certain ways that they learn and giving them knowledge their likes and dislikes school the new technology allows the teachers have options what they throughout the school day that interests the student and helps them learn better,3
the lively impacts from dead engine personal automobiles and cars have played major role throughout the world since the invention the car world war cars have been very successful invention and many people drive their own every day their way work school other places their feet can not carry them though the car has fulfilled its duties making the lives humans easier has also contributed many negative events for example car emissions get trapped the atmosphere and cause living things breathe dirty air around them therefore revolutionary idea has been spreading around the world using personal automobiles less the new aspect using cars less has promoted happier society cleaner environment and open attitude towards alternative transportation first all establishing agreement decrease car use people have been said happier and stress free the continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas the world create enormous amount stress for the people driving many develop road rage irritability and are unhappy after suffering from long ride home because traffic some believe that cities should become more like vauban community germany which the citizens have given their cars because those who live there are not focused driving and are pleased living such manner heidrun walter mother who lives vauban portrays her love for this car free community when she states when had car was always tense much happier this way rosenthal living area with little use cars the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress cope with addition with cars people are forced spend more their time outside get from one place another bogota colombia there annual car free day which anyone who does use their car has pay fine many spend their day outside walking riding their bikes get around and believe that the car free day good opportunity take away stress selsky they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors they wear bright smiles their faces and look things with positive attitude with smaller amount people using their personal vehicles less gas emissions are becoming part the earth atmosphere humans breathe the gases that are polluting the air and can become sick from the environment suffers from the dirty air and may not able sustain life there not stop the large amounts pollutants being emitted into the air the united states passenger cars are the cause percent greenhouse gas emissions while europe they are responsible for percent rosenthal this means that the car use the united states ruining the air around and assists greatly creating disgusting environment popular and global cities pollution even more noticeable and overwhelming for example paris smog has become everlasting issue the climate the area contributes the smog filling the air along with the use cars cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer air trap car emissions chicago tribune reduce the smog the area elaborate plan was taken into action cars with even license plates could not drive certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive the other days doing this the air paris cleared dramatically therefore promoting system where car usage not common the environment can become healthier and cleaner which benefits the citizens the earth last declining the use cars creates open attitude towards alternative transportation methods those who live car free communities discover new ways reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day some will utilize their body and take advantage nature biking walking from one place another others might public transportation will car pool with those who own car previously mentioned before colombia participates car free day which means colombians hiked biked skated took buses get where they needed selsky their use other means transportation the day without cars exemplifies that possible live using other ways get around some people are against the idea using other transportation but they were see the impact the alternatives have they would more accepting these days many young people tend get their license later waiting until they reach their twenties suggesting that they can live happy life without relying personal automobile instead using their own cars they find other ways get work school these people become acclimated organizing their lives around where they can walk take public transportation car pool with friends rosenthal younger people who commit their lives walking public transportation become aware the fact that driving machine that can negatively affect the world not necessity their awareness then can continue passing each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use cars throughout the world conclusion life without cars might life worth

untouched and exactly the same for hundreds years and this has caused extremely outdated not only far too outdated and complicated help our voting process but the electoral college does not give the voters voice instead takes away from them the electoral college also can lead concerning situations that the country and its people not want put for these reasons strongly encourage you make the change and switch election popular vote the question whether not abolish keep the electoral college tact heavily debated one but clear that getting rid the electoral college will highly beneficial the voters america the electoral college was established hundreds years ago when our constitution came about and created complicated process elect the president and vice president the united states our country changing day day and certainly have made monumental changes since the electoral college came according bradford plumer author the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong poll was taken gallup the year that showed that less than just forty percent americans support the election system that have now this proves that time for change and that the

electoral college not only outdated but also extremely complex voting method article entitled what the electoral college written the office the federal register explained that the electoral college lengthy process that involves the choosing electors and the issuing certificates ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted the electoral college does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially believe that america should begin elect its presidents using the popular voting method moreover the electoral college should longer the voting method the american people because the people are given voice with the electoral college process his article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong bradford plumer specifically states that the people themselves not vote for their desired candidate but instead they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate the people should the ones who vote for the president because they will the ones who are governed the president the electoral college gives voice the people and considered many non democratic way voting and often referred anachronism today struggle encourage people vote and present election day because one feels like their vote matters people say that one vote doesn make difference and that there point filling out ballot has real affect which candidate chosen the electoral college and the process established really just confirming these opinions people not feel like they are contributing because when comes down the electoral votes are the deciding votes the electoral college only has little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions regular people who show the polls election day order make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice being heard and increase voter turnout election day imperative that the country switches over election

the electoral college brings about unneccessary problems that could all avoided the country converted the way electing election popular vote summation the electoral college has been around for hundreds years but time that the united states makes the change that would improve the way electing its future presidents the electoral college outdated and complicated does not allow the voice the

one car one life one big accident that all the future asking develope continuing try improve and inspire people use driverless cars not think driverless cars should ever become new big thing for many reasons they can malfunction you they still need assistance they cant handle road situation they might not update any new laws road changes nearby there many negative reasons and thoughts that appear when thinking about the development driverless cars first reason why against driverless cars because they can always malfunction what doesnt see animal the road and runs over will stop help would starting loosing control who knows because your not the one behind the wheel you could have stopped and saved that poor animal instead you let your car take control also what just shuts down turns off completely the middle the road all electronics have point time where they are slow and slowly begin shut down how long would you have the car keep you think driverless car can last you years maybe your lucky the weather and the technology cant keep and hold its together long gas operated automobile what doesnt let you take control because malfunctions and you end hurting someone like says the text the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacture also what even the point have automotive that still needs you the car its not smart enough drive without needing your assistance would useless say you are driving down the street and your texting and letting you car drive its own all sudden crashes and hurts other including yourself would still your fault even though you was not the one driving other words you get car accident would the police put your car jail you well you offcourse your even recovered from the crash your car has put you anyways driverless cars allows drivers think they can keep their eyes off the road when all reality they have pay attention and alert you have have your eyes remained the roads all times then you might well drive atleast you will secure and more alert finally the car over all just big mimic people are tying develope objects with human like qualities the text even says the combination all this input necessary for the driverless car mimic the skill human the wheel personally believe being human special and automobile can never special human life yes may love our cars but never much one would love there children friends family driverless cars are just overall bad idea and should keep our state safe and the people not the only one who agrees driverless cars are illegal most states the text mentions result most states illegal even test computer driven cars this shows that not the only one who belives they are not safe and matter what upgrades and assumptions that are made will not make driverless car good idea lets original and stick the safe way lets avoid the one car one life one accident,5
driverless cars could the next big thing driverless cars sound like good idea first but read this article the dangers this car became more and more like night mare should not able make these kinds cars simply for the dangerous side these cars these types cars could potentially blow seconds their seniors something else has default these cars made for certain situations and only have been tested those situations some concerns that could raised when the car can tell the space between you and another car the development traffic jam and the safety these cars they aren safe first off how know that this car can really park itself alert the driver sure this has been tested but only certain amount cars have been tested with actual people inside the seniors the car can have default and end fatal situation with the car being driverless the safety turning the wheel has scary the car driverless then should all the work the real life driver and the driver shouldn have alert car companies have been making these cars for almost years then what wrong with guess would that their would something its sort already car dealerships ready buy the development traffic jam seems like good idea until you start read further into can wonderful things such alert driver announce when the driver needs take ahold the car but shouldn the car already able this its own yes keeps constant rate mph but what you want faster how will you that have interpret the driving fun new way said werner huber not the fun new way this method driving can cost the lives many and they can also cost the company billions and millions dollars somebody sues them even though traffic jam has some pretty cool features helping stay safe one these have believe see kind things the features traffic jam can distract people more and more finally discussed earlier the safety these cars aren all that great safest that almost all states illegal drive computer driven cars most drivers are alert the only thing that would distract driver would she was their cell phones that why they put laws such texting while driving one thing that has developed who going sued that test driver actual person harmed while testing these cars the driver being focused the gadgets the car this can cause more accidents that texting and driving conclusion google and other car makers should stop making these cars because they can harm people alot should not have driver less cars because when can the car tell park how much space between you and the other cars the development traffic jam and the safety these cars there has been talks about these kind cars before but then they stopped and now new ideas are going big companies don want sued because something that their car did since tela has projected make release for car capable for driving auto pilet percent the time seems car companies have little more testing and fixing surprising think that three major car companies will have self driven cars,4
what the face mars this question many asked themselves when the face was first discovered the viking some believed was proof that there was life mars while others believed was exactly what actually natural landform similar the ones that form commonly the american west such mesa butte these are the facts that cemented nasa belief that this wasn some alien made landform but rather naturally occuring one although few scientist believed that the face like formation was alien artifact still became priority ours nasa get better quality photograph could prove wether was natural landform man made unknown martians april after years speculation and conspiracy that was bullit martins and that were trying hide this information finally got shot taking another photo the face when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time the picture taken with the mars global surveyor was ten times sharper than the original viking photos these photo were what needed cement the fact that was not alien monument all and instead natural landform not everyone was happy with this photo though the face mars located very difficult place photograph and when the moc took the picture there were wispy clouds you had look past the conspirators believed the alien marking maybe covered said clouds alas set out again take another picture this time april cloudless summer day cydonia malin team snapped incredible picture what the picture showed was that the landform was the martian equivalent butte mesa exactly what belived was natural landform this essay may may not have made you believe what this landform actually but what you believe doesn not change the proof the pictures hope that this enlightened you well convince you the landform being completely natural hope you enjoyed reading argument could not convince you thank you for taking your time read this,4
this story the author suggests that studying venus worthy explore despite the dangers presents tells that venus was once been most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life also that venus has familiar features such valleys mountains and creates but despite the belie that life was there also that nasa and others are just curios what they could find from venus first the author did good job pointing out and bringing the reader with venus once have been most earth like planet our solar system long ago but also goes and continues how was covered with oceans secondly the author tell that there are familiar features such valleys mountains and craters venus this makes want pursuit the study venus despite the dangers presents even with all the critical conditions venus has this example want and visit venus lastly venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity human curiosity makes want venus and see what can find and look most humans are very curios and when they find out there was once life venus makes want and see what out there the author put this give another reason why should out venus puts human curiosity bring finaly from all the eight paragraphs feel the author could have done better job their part explain why worth pursuit despite the dangers presents also that the comparison between earth and venus was fine but going venus and exploring and pointed out that there was once life venus gives good example going and exploring venus,3
think that they should have more people join help with the seagoing cowboys program think they should have more people beacuse then will inclusive having more help instead having many animals with not amn people for example you had ten cows and one person then would harder but you had least five people helping then you would have half many which might would have big effect how much more help unwedded wanted what you put different point thought what those cows and horses were going little kids and they were for example going use them for because then would make other people want join for the kids sake would you think that would make more people join more people help more people get involved think brought people attention that joining this could possibly save animal you really think about you could even save farm because cows produce milk and some poeple cant even afford milk and thing that you could get from these animals that are this program the following problem about the farm and cool part about helping would you could overseas you join the program and you have mind like luke then outed this passage would glad have this opportunity and another great benefit out helping joining said the story table tennis tournaments fencing boxing reading whittling and alson games help times pass made more aware people other countries and their needs and you think about with this being quoted said the passage could teach people real lesson about others pinned others help this could learning opportunity this could teach people another reason how they arent the only ones indeed all these reasons are things that support answer how think that they should have more pople join help the seagoing cowboys program,2
the challenge exploring venus the author suggests studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents nasa working try get much data and information about venus possible only because soon could all have space traveling place thats nearly the same earth one day farther studying and knowing about venus called deaths twin the paysage states thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus venus atmosphere the planets surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit this shows why they was considering cars that hover over the land miles because humans wouldnt able the ground that long survivable level but still dangerous levels toxic breath they think venus may have life likely such ours because point time venus was half percent water and could have living things and aloha closely matching looking valleys and mountains like ours they are rally trying take closer look into studying and possibly making there way finally seeing the passage states venus was probablyciovered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familar features such valleys mountain and craters basically these all information have given you for tell you allyl what they are trying wit venus and for good results,2
cars are big deal our everyday society use cars all the time because they are what get from place place further into the future more improvements cars are being made each day one major invention the driverless car the development the driverless car good thing because convenient safe fuel saving and beneficial our knowledge cars many people are always needing travel from place place and don always want drive more convenient just hitch ride from someone such friend taxi but sometimes those aren always the most convenient options taxi drivers could take someone anywhere your friend could under the influence driverless cars are safer because they could take you where you need safely they are also more convenient because sometimes people could impaired and unable drive they would just have driverless car pick them instead this way convenient for people travel without worrying they are going safe not main factor people buying cars they are safe according the article driverless cars are coming these independent cars have driven more than half million miles without crash people could safer driverless car than with someone driving car safety huge deal our society and people buying cars want what best for them and their families driverless cars are safer companies will have good sales and produce better profit this way the economy being benefitted and society the world today try conserve our resources much possible fuel major resource that used power lot things everyday life using driverless cars would limit our use fuel half what taxis use and that phenomenal inventions like the driverless car can lead preserving resources conserving our resources important thing need and fundamental developments like the driverless car can help achieve our goal doing that the research these cars significant for people the future many years ago would have never known all the important things about technology that know today researching and testing the technology the driverless car have produced more efficient knowledge for the future driverless cars need sensors operate similar human driving the car which important creating cars without researching and inventing these important products wouldn have half the knowledge cars that have today driverless cars are beneficial because they are convenient safe fuel saving and important our knowledge cars driverless cars can help people society and people the future the development these cars can influence people create even bigger things the future and that incredible the future brighter than has ever been and the development such product has made this possible the future bright and driverless cars have led further down the road creating newer better inventions,4
belive that the facs technology would valuable think that would valuable because can probably tell student cheating the student tired the facial action coding system would allow the computer track the users face would allow the computer know the student cheating seeing the user smiling little would false able see the user tired bored the user student was tired bored could tell the computer switch little bit and try make whatever they are doing little bit funner the text states that you see your screen and you smile will show you just like that one you frown when you see that will show you completely different one that just couple thing the facs can that why belive that would valuable,2
have you ever wondered about how another planet can just like earth and how its terrain well researchers have found out that venus can have the exact same terrain and other features well venus often referred earth twin has the same density and size and the closest our planet well while researchers try land spacecraft the surface venus almost impossible because the temperatures venus are average degrees farenheit the pressure times more than what experience our own planet would crushed stay there thats only the beginning what goes there there erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes seeking its surface but even after that just like our planet earth because scientist have been looking venus and found that venus has surface rocky sediment and other features like valleys mountains and craters they have also found out that there use covered largely oceans and also could supported various forms life the conclusion all this that even though venus dangerous and also good the same time that can still explore and possibly have human life living there,2
believe that driverless cars are bad idea there are many things that they still would have improve before they would safe they arent totally driverless anyway because you would have stop and start driving when ever you come construction and accident the road going tell you some reasons why dont beleive they are good idea the first reason dont believe that good idea because they dont know how drive through construction accidents that have happens the road yet you could driving down the highway and many accidents that happen you could just come around turn aand then you would have watching very crosley know start tearing the car this could cause some major issues causing other wrecks happen know was driving down the road with driverless car would kicked back repacked you come papon wreck though you could also wreck because you were not ready second reason don think they are good idea because they wont have clue who blame there was accident you got wreck with someone would your fault the other person would the cars fault that you crashed they wouldn know who blame for the wreck someone was get killed these cars the family and friends would blame the cars they could have big problems with this because may have been prevented the car wasn driverless third and final reason what would the price for these cars know that they most likley wont affordable for some people yes the rich could pay for this car because they have lot money and they dont have worry about anything but threeself what about the middle class and the poor they already have worry about there house payment and many other things will these cars mandatory for everyone have don have driverless cars and regular cars the road the same time many people will have some serious trouble buying the vehicle because they are short money this why believe that these driverless cars are not good idea yes some people may think they are the best thing ever some may just not care tuley believe that will much safer and the other cars are more dependable just stayed with the old fashion you drive the care with gas pedal and brake new technology good things but this case think that they are taking things little too dar,4
why shouldn use facs technology classroom facs technology shouldn used classrooms and there are several good reasons why some the things that people value the most are their money good education and privacy implementing facs technology can disrupt all these things that people value first all the author this article nick alto never even mentions the cost this technology seeing this technology isn even fully developed yet would presumably cost millions dollars research even get fully developed working product when new technology comes out usually more expensive then anything else the market school the last place that should using its resources for emotion reading system most schools are lacking funding and resources which leading cuts many music and athletic departments another pretty well known fact that schools spend less money cafeteria food then jails school getting additonal funding these are the types things that they should spending not useless emotion readers this goes into the second reason which effectiveness and practicality how know that what this computer saying actually correct sometimes there are some things that advanced technology just can not solve computer may sense sad confused look student face but that doesn necessarily tell you why they are sad confused huang from the article says that based off the look your face the computer could modify the lesson first all teacher teaching lesson probably wouldn want computer modifying what she wants teacher shouldn modify the whole lesson for the entire class just because someone has certain look their face for reasons that may not even school related modifying lesson for students who aren even struggling could potentially ruin the way they learn and how quickly and effectively they learn and understand concepts teacher senses that certain student confused not paying attention they could always talk them after class and fix the problem which much more efficient and effective way doing third reason that this facs technology shouldn implemented for privacy while the author does list some useful applications for this technology such surgeries and video games common computers for everday use not where should used one reason that people fear this advanced technology their own computers for privacy many students probably don want camera their school laptops constantly scanning their faces see what kind emotions they have many students would see that creepy and intrusive and would probably complain the adminstration remove people value many things life but some the most important are their money good education and and their privacy having this facs technology schools can ruin all these things which why using this technology classroom not valuable,5
this face from mars just natural landform can created from aliens because aliens not exist also one has ever seen real alien before they could just making this for the entertainment and attention the face even looks like human head can prove that the evidence that nasa has the face even resembles human head there shadowing that makes the face natural landform the shadowing gives illusion eyes nose and mouth according paragraph april mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time and snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos thousands web surfers all over the world were waiting for the image appear jpl web site revealed that was natural landform and not alien monument may look like the face was created aliens but really doubtful there not that much evidence that could been alien marking perhaps could been the wind and water making rocks collide form the face there could missing evidence that nasa might not cached but nasa does have evidence that can say was just natural landform,2
venus not only one the brightest points light the night sky but also one the most dangerous planets our solar system the second planet from our sun sometimes referred earths twin have sent numerous spacecrafts land venus but not single one has lasted more then few hours its atmosphere this why spacecraft has touched down for three decades its surface because thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide covers all venus venus average temperature over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times grater then what experience our own planet astronomers are still fascinated venus even though dangers because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system astronomers think that was covered with oceans valleys mountains and craters easily could have had forms life venus nasa has idea sending humans venus what they would having blimp like vehicle hovering over miles over venus landscapes collect information venus dangerous plant but could also planet that has lot potential old life forms but nobody knows for sure how venus was its still question until can see for ourself our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,2
what the electoral college the electoral college process not place would have argue favor keeping the electoral college changing election popular vote for the president the united states would have agree with keeping the electoral college would agree because the electoral college consists electors majority required elect presidents and think that fair amount people who are required vote this electoral college process consists the selection the electors the meeting where they vote for president and vice president and the counting the electoral votes congress these votes are very important because with those votes you are making very important choice voting for the president and vice president should not stop because you could make difference with just one vote you never know and you would not want just anybody your president right these electoral votes should not stop this election held every four years the tuesday after the first monday november make vote for our candidate are actually voting for our candiate electors very important after the presidential election your governor prepares what they call certificate ascertainment what that listing all the candidates who ran for president your state along with the names their respective electors important because shows which electors will represent your state the meeting the electors december year the certificates ascertainment are sent the congres and the national archives part the official records the presidential election bradford wrote the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong talks about how some people prefer direct election the kind have now and how this year voters can expect another close election which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency yet the the electoral college still has defenders this shows electoral college good because still has its defenders says the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state some voters feel like electoral college unfair but others not they should electoral college because all the reasons just gave wether some people like not they should not abolish electoral college,2
the author feels that further study venus are dangerous but worth the time and effort this passage describes the conditions and states the challenges that come with the exploration venus venus our lovely evening star our sister planet sounds beautiful doesnt don fooled the nicknames this planet have you ever heard looks can deserving you shoud keep that mind when you are thinking about venus venus the second planet from the sun but has the hottest surface temperature any planet the entire solar system even with mercury being the closest the sun with atmosphere almost perent carbon dioxide and temperatures degrees miles away living there would impossible the surface there are erupting volcanos huge earthquakes and probes that land its surface have been reported shocked lightning venus got the sister plangent name due its similar density and size planet earth there also thereby that venus was one covered oceans rocky sediments similar valleys and mountains and could have been obtaining some type life forms humans are known for their curiosity even when could leave them dead order any further megachurch venus technology that can withstand insane amounts heat would have created then tested scientists have yet explore enough venus difficult collect rocks dust gasses for any type examination feel that the future scientist will create device that can help explore the surface venus safely amd effectively reading this passage really made interested learning about venus and also feel that further exploration would worth waiting for the correct technology further studies would effective because would know more about the mysteries space,3
should the facial action coding system used classroom environment would being able tell students emotions help with giving them the lesson think would for few different reasons think the facial action coding system should used inside and outside the classroom would help the teachers know what going inside the students heads which then they could give the lesson way that the students could feel better about their work this also would help the teachers know what may happening students lives the facial action coding system could also used look pictures people and see what their emotions were when that picture was taken the facial action coding system could and should also used everyday jobs would let the employees boss bosses know what emotions they are feeling while working which would then let their boss bosses know whether fire them change their work environment which the long run would lead happy not upset any other positive emotions the employees could have the facial action coding system should definitely used classrooms and even the workforce think this technology should released the public soon possible even though most people can read others facial expressions just looking their face,3
who ever thought that computer would able tell you how you are feeling know never thought this would happen but again technology gets better and better everyday the use the technology that allows people read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable because can help the teachers think about what they can make that student student have better day and can help teachers learn the different facial expressions that connect with the certain emotions help them determine how student really feeling the use this technology would valuable because can help teachers think about what they can help student the use this technology can help decide whether student really understands the work given them there just lying becuase they don want ask questions because what others might think for example when looked the painting mona lisa thought that she wasn happy person but realized was wrong the first sentence the first paragraph stated that she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry the use this technology can also valuable because can help teachers learn the different facial expressions that connect with certain emotions help them see how student really feeling this may able help teachers stop altercations from accusing because the facial action coding system will allow the teacher see how angry upset the student may for example person really angry the system will detect that overall the facial action coding system would very valuable this article has helped able detect certain emotions peron may have this system would give teachers better understanding about how students are feeling the use this system can help teachers better students and help teachers determine how student feeling based their facial expression,4
there were driverless cars would crazy because hate walking its not that lazy its just that wouldn feel right without any cars there should not driverless cars because everyone doesn enjoy walking very much probably would some type other transportation instead cars such train bike bus etc just imagine there were cars train stations would crowded there would probably arguments all the time just wouldn feel right this was happen would try everything power try and stop what going the roads the world would just look empty nobody was ever earth dont think everybody this world would get the mindset not having car some people might think possible but thats not humility possible would have some type debate for something like this happen but honest opinion that never happen only everybody thought the same then maybe can pulled off there should debate for this,1
venus important study because long ago could have supported life but now that there are dangers studying the plant some call venus earth twin studying venus would good for earth because venus could have supported various form life means the somewhere venus corroded and that mite steer away from becoming secondary venus venus being very difficult study because the pressure time greater than earth and temperature average being over degrees making difficult land stay living for medium period time enough time gather sample for studying although that venus would good explore for science sake would bad idea for the fact that vence atmosphere mainly sulfuric acid whole trying test flight venus was good idea that know now that going venus bad idea because three decades not single spaceship has touched down venus these reasons think very bad idea study venus because all the danger,2
being the second planet from the sun venus has gained attention from scientists and try lot way make our way the venus but none the scientist have ever get lay their hands the venus venus one the brightest points the light night sky and very challenging place examine more closely venus referred earth twin because its the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too sometimes venus only the right corner space terms scientist has sent numerous spacecraft landin venus but each previous mission unmanned and spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours venus has thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide and surface venus the temperature average degrees fahrenheit and times greater atmospheric pressure than what experience erath even though like that the scientists fascinated venus because may well once have been earth like planet our solar system hovering safely far above the planet peering venus from ship orbiting far above the planet can provide only limited information researches can not take any forms rocks gas anything from the distance therefor understand the venus they would need get upclose nasa working other way approaching the venus and some electronics have been tested and only lasted couple week such conditions old technology have been looking back even though the modern technology are powerful and fast but old technology have their own advantage exposing the tablet phone acid heat capable melting tin can damage your phone the extent damage but system that use mechanical part can ade more resistant pressure heat and other resources the human curiosity will led the discovery new things the venus the curiosity can lead alot things and expanded meet very edgers imagination being the second planet after the sun venus catch lot people attention from all over the world,2
limiting car usage might thought most wont even think about but thats not the case countrys from all over the world are partaking this new way the reason why people are doing this clean the polluted air breath growing project that europe introduced suburbs without cars europe town germany constructed this experimental suburb project for little cars the community this place home residents and there are practically cars the main source transportation tram you are allowed own car but its extra year america they are not close carring out this idea but the last year the number license are going down and the number cars being sold and hiw much are driving this concludes that are taking consideration how much emissions are putting into the air france paris enforced partial ban driving clear smog the city monday motorists with even numbered plates were ordered leave cars home the same would apply for the odd numbered plated the following day public transportation was free from friday monday these ideas helped clear the air pollutants but took long time because hiw much pollution was the air due france favoring diesels over gasoline another way people are cleaning the air and limiting car usage car free day bogota columbia the giral this promote alternative transportation and reduce smog bogota large city homed million citzens this idea day without cars was started boots the because this parks and sports centers have booms and many miles bike trails have been constructed for the recreational use but also urge people not use cars and clean the air these ideas have been expressed reduce the usage cars using cars less will have huge effect the ozone and how much pollutant the air,2
dear state senator think should end the electoral college because not fair each american not fair because voters can control who they pick and the person they vote for end losing the presidential election even though our founding fathers established this act doesn mean benefits our country the electors are chosen the candidate democratic republican party some states has winner take all process when that process over and the candidate win the presidential vote that state then shows which electors will represent your state although this would seem like good way vote disagree unfair everyone would lot easier for every citizen just make their own personal vote for example back gore had way more popular voters than george bush who had higher number voters due the electoral college process think every state should reconsider picking the electors because they always seem defy losing the electoral college can also avoid any mishap the future what there was state that had equal number votes what would happen then has been stated that over percent citizens would rather vote towards their candidate they select rather than going through the process congress should consider the thoughts and opinions that voters have they wish not the candidate with the popular votes could potentially lose presidency conclusion the eyes the government may seem like proper way vote but unfair you should abolish the electoral college for good can elect the right candidate who deserves presidency order get rid this process should take single vote from every citizens,3
the use driverless cars something very controversial todays times years ago there wasn enough technological advances have cars that can driven computer believe that the use computer driven cars bad thing when one these cars are the road there chance that there could wreck but that did happen who would fault person could have been driving and caused wreck but they could say the computer was fault this would let people get easier when they cause car accidents there could obstacles that the car misses when driven the computer the computer may not have seen car front and kept driving there would way knowing what happened and who would fault most states dont have laws concerning the cars and some dont even allow you test drive them most states illegal even test computer driven cars this means that states have made illegal even test the cars this shows that they would dangerous because there are laws against there way that they are safe yes there way telling normal cars are completely safe but there one but the human driver fault normal car the owners normal cars can say that computer was driving the car the time because wouldn possible even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident the technology fails and some one injured who fault the driver the manufacturer this means that the cars legalized would have have another law just for them say hawo would fault accident happened and someone was injured could the manufacturer the driver but there would completely positive reason for one the other fault there ever was accident and somebody was killed the car for any other person there would investigation say the human the car was drunk the person could say the computer was driving the time and there would way knowing the person was telling the truth not what the law said the manufacturer was fault they could have let someone who was guilty crime and charged the company that made the car how would that fair the family that lost someone wouldn that why the driverless cars are bad idea there are many reasons for one say they would good but the good outweigh the bad there reasonable doubt that the cars would unsafe that they are illegal most states they should not allowed out the roads because nobody knows what could happen until does happen there would laws for this specific type vehicle but how accurate would the punishments something bad happened because the car wouldn equal that driver normal car because the smart cars have two options for who blame there would never any way sure that the person blamed was the one fault that why the new smart cars being invented should not allowed the streets they are just not safe enough yet,4
venus the evening star since its the brightest point light the night sky humans have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world and each mission was unmanned since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours and vere touched venus more than tree decades the thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide and the clouds are even more challenging since their highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere and the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than experience earth and the environment would crush even submarine venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported forms life and has familiar features surah valleys mountains and craters and conclusion could possibly buli something survive venus could find some amazing things like ever ahad water and find maybe remains past forms life,1
new president really how many votes did they win someone were ask you this what would you say thirty electoral votes the winner takes all system flawed and needs either fixed completely taken down and here are two reasons why first president should chosen the people seeing our county democracy meaning that elect representatives rule for popular vote fits the sene bit more than electoral vote secondly there was every tie the electoral college would catastrophic because instead being the peoples hand the representatives hands aslo known the ones who already have power the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters because the winner takes all system each state candidates dont spend time states they spend time stats the know thy wont win some states can get candidates out and its because the electoral college unfair official the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments favor are mostly assertions without much basis reality and the arguments against direct election spurious best its hard say but bob dole was right abolish the electoral college this quote states that the electoral college not fair and down right pediculus you may say since its getting the job done and there has been ties whats wrong there are manny thing wrong startin with popular votes can lose electoral votes also some states can get people come and campagne sift just could have cause tie the polls this article just that many people and the representatives could have chosen president and the reason this bad because they will get president that will what ever they want there were just voters ohio and voters hawaii that went the other way the electoral college would have tied making representative choose this article just that many people and the representatives could have chosen president and the reason this bad because they will get president that will what ever they want finalize the winner takes all system flawed and needs either fixed completely taken down and here are two reasons why first president should chosen the people seeing our county democracy meaning that elect representatives rule for popular vote fits the sene bit more than electoral vote secondly there was every tie the electoral college would catastrophic because instead being the peoples hand the representatives hands aslo known the ones who already have power,3
some people believe that the face was created aliens but some say the face just another landform you read this essay you will find out why and the face landform not some scientists believe that the face was just another landform because they had the same thing happened with the martian mesa few days later people had the chance see the picture nasa let the people see people would attracted mars the face haunted the media for years people thinks the face landform because the face was located cloudy place they didn stop with the picture they increased the size three they could get good look the picture actually shows the martian butte mesa they waited until summer take another look the landform and nasa told the world that the face was just natural landform,1
the author makes very strong statement when says should explore venus the author finds the exploration worthy nasals time dangerous may exploring venus would determine whether not could new home for the human race and all other sources life would significant breakthrough for survival when the author says that venus the closest planet earth terms size and density sounds like venus should our next home not that easy the author explains many times nasa has sent spacecrafts venus see what had offer most crafts became worthless after short period time the planet not one spacecraft has landed venus over thirty years zero research was able done due the extremes the planet the planet venus closer the sun than earth resulting extreme temperatures around degrees the outer crust the planet thick atmosphere carbon dioxide cover venus along with clouds made sulfuric acid the atmospheric pressure also insane extreme scaling around ninety times that earth volcanoes earthquakes and lightning are all challenges that come along with venus well nasa has figured out ideas send man study venus though would floating miles from the surface would gather more information than have the time masa also trying engineer spacecraft that will able land the planet and last long they need want overall the author shows the strive gather information venus and how setting further the future than never before venus very dangerous indeed but new ideas and theories are being made everyday trying conquer what venus has brought the table the author summarizes this our travels earth any beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,4
opinion think that good idea manufacturers develop smarter cars for the future creating smarter cars helps reduce accidents due the improvements that would added the cars they also allow driving more easier for everyone lastly new and developed cars make driving more interesting and fun creating smarter cars helps reduce accidents due the improvements that would added the newly developed cars google has had cars that could drive themselves for more than half million milles and without crashing the article said the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone which indicates that the cars are being specially made help out drivers able drive better and safer these improvements would help lot drivers such adding cameras the cars they can monitor the drivers and make sure they are paying attention there are many reckless drivers that not pay attention the road and use their phones these improvements would help save lives the cars would able steer accelerate and brake themselves the car would able drive safer than person who constantly their ponette could cause accident also developed driver seats that vibrate when vehicle danger backing into object allow manufacturers develop better cars they would make driving easier these cars are able handle driving functions speeds mph these cars are made not only help the driver but aslo makes sure that the driver paying attenion they know when take over these cars are made the point where they are almost driverless they are capable steering accelerating and they are also able brake themselves these developed cars make driving easier because they notify the driver when there are work zones accidents understand they are not capable driving thru these occurance but since they notify the driver helps them plan out different route that could save them time lastly the development cars would make driving more interesting and fun many people imagine the future with flying cars and very high tech cars should take advantage that technology allowing these dreams come alive would very interesting see cars that are able tio drive themselves without human use some developers such the google cofounder sergey brin are envisioning the future with better transportation sergey forsees that there would cars that would use less fuel and offer far more flexibility than bus would find very astonishing see car like that being able sit the driver seat and just let your car drive its own would amazing experience you could eating talk the phone without any concern because your car driving safely can would very cool able experience all these technological developments conclusion think its great idea let manufacturers develop these cars these cars would help out reducing accidents would also allow driving more safe because you have smart develoment that allows elcar drive its own lastly these cars would such amazing experience for the future have let technology and manufacturers with new ideas its thing actually want see all our envisions the future the future would much better easier and more fun allow the develoment these cars,4

dear state senator have been citizen the united states for entire life and through studies research and personal experiences with the electoral college system have come the conclusion that the electoral college system not only out date way casting vote but also ineffective way electing president believe that the popular vote both directly reflects and accurately shows which politician citizens have chosen will best lead our country the electoral college merely way for politicians attempt swing the vote their favor paying more attention states that contain more electors politicians should concerned about gaining the votes individuals regardless how many electoral college members their states contain there very little need for the electoral college even exist all there absolutely point having two ways for collecting the votes citizens when all that the system requires for one the candidates gather more votes than the other having the electoral college does not help the voting process and therefore will only harm make the process electing president ineffective many cases the votes the electoral college against what the popular votes want and tend cause unwanted politician into office not the only citizen concerned about this system there are people all across the united states who dislike the electoral college and who see that constantly gets the way electing decent president into office there have been politicians chamber commerce members and everyday citizens who have stood aginst this awfully electoral college and who have realized just how terrible and ineffective putting this system out commission will easy task but enough citizens like myself write their local state and federal congress members change just might possible though group effort would required destroy this system would extremely difficult convince politicians and presidents that have been office for years destroy this college that allowed for them into office would also exceptionally difficult get all three branches the united states government destroy the electoral college afterall would only take the president veto stop from being removed there are counter claims mine that sure you will recieve within your time office counter claims that you should ignore think that you should look over all the evidence all the facts and all the sources that you can inorder form your opinion whether not the electoral college should stay should terminated some the claims that you will recieve will not have much basis and will most likely state that the system has been existence ever since the founding the united states these claims are not based evidence the system being correct being fair these calms are based fear change change tends scare people especially when their power voting may altered due major change the government but over the past several decades alone our country has undergone many wonderful changes and experiences that have positively affected its citizens and its laws two these changes include the desegregating schools and the right for women vote these changes are extremely positive just like the destroying the electoral college would would have positive impact all the country citizens and would allow for the united states show that too can change and adapt for the better not writing this letter you because think that you can single handily change the voting system the united states writing this letter you because have faith that you can help change the opinion your fellow politicians and state leaders hope that you use the facts and research that have presented you today and continue gather more evidence the electoral college system and why holding back our country from properly electing its presidents thank you very much for both your time and your consideration wish you luck changing the system and informing others about the problem sincerely proper name,5

how would you feel robots had your life their possesion driverless cars are being developed many different manufacturers driverless cars are not safe enough put the road they can cause accidents and injuries they glitch out malfunction driverless cars are bad idea and will big problem going into the future one reason becasue the cars can cause accident and seriously injure someone that wasn even driving fact traffic laws most states not allow driverless cars the road the cars have not been proven safe enough handle most extreme conditions another good point the cars could have glitch the system and get into accident the robotic cars would complete control the passenger life and other once starts driving the road they not alert the passenger take the wheel could injure them and other drivers counter argument could point out that the cars have various safety precautions and will alert the passenger take the wheel but glitches the system could occur and fail alert the passenger the manufacturers could get into big trouble even the car didn malfunction because people wouldn know the passenger the car was fault the situation driverless cars are not needed this world course they would cool and convenient thing have around but they are too risky and dangerous brought into everyday life not approve this until the manufacturers prove that they are safe enough withstand storm the same question could asked how would you feel robots had your life their possesion,4
the author suggests studying venus worthy pursuit matter the dangers faces the author well states the topic she would talking about the author mentioned that since not similar earth terms weather climate changes that should discover the closest planet apart from mars she included some positive and possible solutions such airplane flying over storms solar power would plentiful air pressure sea level radiation would not exceed earth levels etc the author knows what they are talking about and wants prove that venus worth get studied for the author mentioned that some our earth problems could solved venus due its conditions and how venus not bad compared our planet earth the article the author states that imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape just our jet airplanes travel higher altitude fly over many storms vehicle coveting over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way this shows how venus not all bad planet even think live shows how there solutions most the negatives has and how could somehow somewhat living descriptively explains the reader and making them imagine what would like live venus someday therefore the author efficiently dodge the many the negatives venus has mentioning some the things that nasa doing and some the positives could bring that have our world today conclude the author states and mentions how venus worth get studied for mentioning the many positives could include live mentions how vehicle such car could fly venus and the same time avoid terrain obstacles which problem have deal with today how airplanes could fly over storms which another problem have today and how flights have cancel their flights due bad weather one postive aspect about venus was that solar power could more efficent there then our planet earth since some parts the world solar energy just dream therefore the author efficiently states his point provides evidence and reasoning why should further the investigations studying venus,3

the article the challenge exploring venus the author suggest that venus worthy being studied despite the dangers that presents humans have landed the moon and sent and lended rovers mars why not try and land rover venus the author does good job supporting his her claim that should and study venus more talking about how may well once been the most earth like planet our solar system sending blimp like vehicles hover above the surface and testing that nasa has done venus may well once been the most earth like planet our solar system the article the author states the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes features such valleys mountains and craters the author says paragraph long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the authors means that since venus has all these terrains that are similar earth that may have had liquid water the surface and the right temperatures support life the next paragraphs the author talks about imagining sending blimp like vehicle venus hover around miles above the surface like how our jet planes fly higher altitude avoid flying storms towards the end paragraph states that the temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth this shows that use the right materials could fly the blimp like aircraft and study how the air pressure and the exact degrees the atmosphere would lastly the author explains how the testing that nasa has done the text the author says nasa working other approaches studying venus some simplified electronics silicon carbide have been tested simulating the chodas venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions this shows that the author getting information from reliable source nasa the author also dives deeper and talks about how another project looking back old technology called mechanical computers and that they can resist physical conditions better than modern computers conclusion the author did great job saying that venus worthy studying even though the dangers that presents her supported their idea well with reasons like how venus may well once been the most earth like planet our solar system saying that earlier venus lifetime that was probably covered water and supported various lifeforms another reason was imagine sending blimp like spacecraft hover miles above the surface venus and lastly the test that nasa has been doing spacecrafts withstand venus surface for least three weeks this are good reasons back the claim that the author has made,4

think that the author should further his study because the things that they already predicted used venus and the things that are now there they said that venus sister planet earth think that strongly possible that there was life and lots other thing venus there wasn life there then they could had the chance having life there earth were end the passage says the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familar features such valleys mountains and craters venus having things like that are the exact reason that venus should explored getting venus might tough thing though this passage also states that spacecraft the landing for more than few hours getting venus will one dangerous yet good trips take while traveling venus could very risky and dangerous imagine the experience you get traveling venus wouldn like going italy better chance see something new scientist are actually speaking about visits the planet the future because venus closer the sun really hot there hopefully scientist can figure that out that could possibly huge part why spacecraft has yet land there that people can and explore venus nasa working new ways and study venus they looking into old technology from world war nasa says that our modern computers are lot more delicate than computers from back those times basically mixture the old technology from the and modern day technology could possibly help travel venus think that traveling venus would could something new for have lots things work course before setting off venus there are mountains and valley and all other things like that think that worth giving shot,3

disagree with the belief that the face mars was created aliens disagree because team called the moc proved that the face just natural landform taking picture ten times clearer than the original one understand that some might say was very cloudy day when they took the pictures but the team took pictures couple years later and proved the same thing again the face mars just natural landform believe just natural landform because when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time the team moc took picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos although some people still say was cloudy and perhaps the alien markings were hidden haze still possible that they had gotten some very clear photos ampil cloudless day cydonia mars global surveyor went for second look they used camera with absolute maximum resolution for example each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo conclusion the face mars just natural landform the pictures show landforms common around american west the team have proved over and over again that the face mars was not created aliens the cameras over the years have improved and the photographs became clearer,3
this article the suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit other than the dangers has there are many dangers for exploring venus some those dangers are the thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid atmosphere and the surface the plant surface temperature averages over degrees fahrenheit even though has its dangers worthy pursuit say this because much like earth the article they refer our sister planet they say the article much like because they beleived long ago was covered oceans could have supported forms life and other similarities this shows worthy pursuit what one day earth dies and there becomes whole new worl with life venus say that because the article they compared much real life earth,2

alien made naturally made the called face mars not face made from aliens the face just rock formation with shadows there reason believe that the face make aliens the face mars just martian mesa the text states that scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia ony this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh that states that they just figured that was mesa the time being april they truly found out that was just rock formation the information the text states and april when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera moc team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all not everyone was satisfied though the face mars located degrees north martian latitude where was winter april cloudy time the year the red planet the camera board mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face perhaps said skeptics alien markings were hidden haze the people were still thinking that there were aliens that made the face the mission controllers prepared look again april cloudless sumer day cydonia mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look had roll the spacecraft degrees center the face the field view said garvin malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the vest viking photo they found that the picture was actually shows the martian equivalent butte messa therefore the face mars just another rock figure with shadows they have solved the mystery wether the face alien made naturally made,3

the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the story the author supports his her idea saying the planets surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet this helps support the claim because the author talking about the dangerous heat that people would experience venus the author also supports the claim stating paragraph two that numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite its proximity this also supports the authors claim becuase she saying that venus challenging planet study the text the author also states while venus simple see from the distant but safe vantage point earth has proved very challenging place examine more closely this supports the claim because the author saying that you can not examine venus more closely because challenging and dangerous these claims help evaluate how well the author supported his claim because they explain why venus dangerous and challenging explore they also help evaluate how well the author did giving good examples why the author said what they said,3
all for having this technology read students emotional expressions student myself get bored easily during class honestly bored right now maybe the teachers knew that students get bored during class maybe then they could find way keep students busy maybe even make school school work little more fun the text says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored well that right there would help the teachers well the student this facial recognition can tell that are also confused then the teacher would know what need help with most students are shy and don want say anything when they are confused with their work this whole thing would just much easier honestly don understand why this isn already thing the passage also states then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor seriously the only person that thinks this great idea the students that have hard time classroom setting could seriously use these this would probably help home schooled kids all saying that scientists need jump this and get out here where kids that struggle school can actually enjoy and graduate this great idea and will stand opinion until this thing the fact that there could something out there that could not only the older school setting but also the kids that have adhd that can focus nephew has the hardest time school not just because that but because most teachers now days are lazy and considerate about what goes the classroom and have seen this first hand this facial recognition thing could amazing thing for students all the globe,3
the article the challenge exploring venus has lots useful information about the planet venus and difficulty explored well why worth exploring despite the danger even though dangerous explore venus the article does have some good points regarding why worth the risk explore one example from the article paragraph which reads astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system this excerpt helps show that earth and venus were quite similar one point making important explore and discover how both planets were similar and humans could live venus some point well many other unanswered questions another good point that the author makes paragraph which reads recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel this part the article helps show that there can many practical uses for information discovered about venus during these explorations even there danger involved when trying explore overall the author has strong argument for the benefits exploring venus outweighing the danger and difficulty,3
the use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom not taht valuable because you can tell how person might feeling looking their face expression people show their feelings showing their facial expression towards others but some people just wont show how they feel with facial expressions they might express their emotions through words emotional expressions are not always true version person feelings people some times pretend express something else then how they really are feeling inside everyone has gone through the same problem having fake smile and pretend happy but the inside you might just feel awful also there reason why computer should tell how emotionally feeling the paragraph shows how student gives his her partner directions how move the muscles smile which shows that looking the muscles someone facial expression can aslo tell their emotional expressions knowing how someone feel can aslo make you figure out way how you could help out and make them feel better they not feeling well computer can help out someone feel better but humans can technology not valuable for students classroom can help read your emotional expressions but can help you feel better way,3

did the author support their idea well this article believe did saw many reasons why should least try venus gave many reasons how venus very similar earth and could inhabited one day also gave many reasons how could dangerous and why people haven really been able yet they mention things about what venus has done other space crafts the past and what can others now even the author gives many reasons why venus refered earths twin says venus the closest planet earth density and size and occasionally the closest distance too this tells that venus like earth the ways how dense and how large also says that occasionally close that shows that could just like earth but with some differences the author also says paragraph may have once been the most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported many forms like just like earth with this telling that there could fossils could one day maybe inhabit venus needed with adaptations course the author also says that the journey would dangerous mentions paragraph each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since space craft has survived the landing for more than few hours this telling just how dangerous because topically you would think machine being tougher than the human body but you think about you can see just fast that machine was destroyed that machine was destroyed quickly imagine how quickly the human body would also says not single spacecraft has touched down venus more than three decades this also lets know how hard would get there and how fast the right materials aren used something can destroyed during the trip the author then gives nasa plan how somebody would able access venus paragraph tells that nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray gives this idea that can think about being safer route and that maybe with this method somebody could able make with his evidence the previous paragraphs can conclude would very dangerous land venus but not above also gives scenario what would like for the scientists floating above tells vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying out their way temperatures would still toasty haroun degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans telling this saying that wouldn the most comfortable thing but would liveable showing that would possible and they really wanted they could explore venus paragraph mentions that the scientist floating above would only give limited insight with this can see that there still wouldn everything solved but would still closer than ever gotten also says paragraph most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms photography and videography ineffective meaning that the scientists wouldn able photograph anything venus look later the scientists would only able look things closet than anybody ever has but not able document any with this can also see that wouldn able see what venus looked like from earth making hard report back findings and research all all beleive the author did support his idea well gave the pros and cons and was able explain everything out myself don know would worth all the money supplies but think with nasa idea can get closer than ever gotten before the conditions would liveable but maybe little uncomfortable and could get some good information venus venus closely related earth the author makes out then maybe could worth shot but still debating nothing the author did because did explain and support everything very well but always had very strong opinions everything,5

driverless cars aren new topic the automotive world they weren advanced they were now but now they much more advanced and more practical since the modern era can fully understand why people just want hurry make cars that drive themselves but just doesn seem very practical driverless cars would have more faults than benefits the road people just want upgrade everything without seeing the faults evolving for example the car still needs driver manage why you need upgrade doesn even fulfill its own namesake the limited automotive use really just puts the driver more risk because the possibility malfunction that note since the cars are lined with high tech equipment and whatnot wouldn the accident that kind vehicle more severe something could explode and injure much more than the drivers this also would make one these cars far more difficult replace states the article with being filled with sensors and other high tech equipment this could lead thousands dollars being thrown out the window for repairs the end the benefits having driverless car are outweighed the faults the call still pretty tough since the idea still underexplored whole for all know the problems could get worked but manual cars won become obsolete manual cars still retain the more benefits mind,3

dear florida senator there has been much controversy over whether not should keep the electoral college have removed and vote the president based popular vote believe the best decision change election popular vote for the president the united states the system would change people would feel like their votes actually matter more then they now they wouldn have worry about the electors flipping sides some people though say that the way the election now completely fair the case votes are based population begin with the electoral college was taken out use more people would feel like their vote matters although you may think you are voting for your choice president you are not now when you cast your vote you are actually just voting for your candidate electors said what the electoral college the campaign voters seventeen states didn have chance see the candidates all those candidates went mainly the swing states states that were not certain who they would voting for the states unvisited such rhode island and south carolina were passed over because the candidates knew they would wouldn have their vote matter what the ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance see either candidate their state defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president the romney and obama election mentioned brings the fact that romney knew that throughout the south was going get their vote realized that there was need there because didn need anymore popularity the south because had already gained their electoral votes those who opposed romney the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for romney the system were change which believe should more people would feel their votes mattered matter what state they were addition feeling like your vote matters people never know the electors would flip their depictions the slate electors not picked the people said the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong that sometimes the state conventions the party central committee the presidential candidates themselves choose who will their electors that being said you don know whether not the electors will follow your choice president not for example some electors refused vote for their party candidate and they chose whomever they wanted were switch the way things are now that would not happen poll taken called the gallup poll showed that over voters prefered direct election rather then the kind have now this took place when gore recieved the popular vote but lost the electoral votes you can see that the current system has its flaws many people say that fair for all states because their amount electoral votes for example defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president florida which has much larger population than wyoming recieved electoral votes for obama while wyoming only had electoral votes this the same time though makes candidates want only the larger states try get their votes the smaller states once again feel left out and unappreciated conclusion strongly feel that need change election popular vote above all more fair the people citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they now people wouldn have worried about the electors would flip what they had voted for although some say its absolutely fair throughout all the states there are still the set backs that come along with keeping electoral college agree with former presidents nixon and carter that need abolish the electoral college all these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system electing our president and know you will agree,5
being classroom with large amount students can intimidating this makes easier for student fall behind classroom setting since they may too scared ask question one may thinking what they laugh raise hand maybe that student may need different teaching approach but they not know how convey this them there could solution this problem new technology uses computer that constructs computer model the face making mona lisa smile can used process the emotions that student may feeling meaning that technology reading emotional expressions students classroom valuable and beneficial reading the emotions students can help the teachers gather more beneficial data them they constantly say that they are not mind readers however many students may embarrassed that they are not quite understanding the content which this technology could provide some assistance the computer could simply read and see what percentage the class confused large percentage then that means the teacher can over whole class also working vise versa meaning that smaller percentage then the teacher can make smaller groups and provide the needed attention them this theory was stated huang ¨´a classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor making mona lisa smile although the article refers online classes the same can applied the human interactive classroom the teacher can look the data during the lesson check understanding along the way and then provide the extra needed support those that need then let those that understand move forward that way the children dont fall behind and the children that understand the content can further challenged providing more effective and rigourous coursed another benefit that this technology presents that can read the distressing emotions student especially during the high school years which are very stressful both the workload and character development teacher able see that student upset angry stressed even combination these emotions because by weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions vinci masterpiece making mona lisa smile student had particularly stressful event their household they may feel angry frustrated and sad the teacher can then understand that they are going through moment and sure provide some support also the students are feeling especially stressed the teachers may even provide some kind stress relief day since prolonged stress can have some serious effects the human body this technology may even able detect mental illnesses such depression anxiety which the student can provided with the support that they need possibly leading the prevention suicide attempts and anxiety attacks conclusion having technology the classroom can extremely beneficial both the students and the teachers can provide useful data the teachers which they can adjust their teaching plan accordingly and effectively educate all the students furthermore can help students dealing with mental health issues making sure that they get the help and support that they need order the most attentive the classroom they can technology continues implemented into the teaching program this computer software should considered well,5
the author say that worthy pursuit despite the dangers going venus says that dangerous and not worth said very challenging and proved which means its hard get their and could dangerous many people tried their but never landed venus they even also sent out space crafts and they disappear just dont even make close venus someone evr makes their would dangerous space craft has made their for more then decades says that that dangerous because the bad things that could happend like humans check out will bad because there acid flowing around the air also think dangor because was proved challenging and because one ever made their even spacecrafts havent venus also has the hottest temperature the surface then any other planet which dangerous for humans human ever makes their could dangerous they are their for long they have limit how long they should stay their this means that dangerous venus also think that nasa people should just not try their because people could get nervous when they their and just forget about the limit time they should their the author was right fro what read and the reasons saw why was dangerous venus,2

have you ever seen ever been mars most you might have not but studying mars part job believe that the face mars natural landform because aliens not exist nasa has proved that natural landform and looks like landforms earth first reason because aliens not exist there has been much research this world prove that aliens not exist but still some people believe that there are aliens whenever something weird happens space always have say aliens exist and there lot proof that they don mars landforms can change just like any other planet for example started out looking like bump then warped into many different shapes with cracks ridges and the end turned out looking like face second reason because nasa has proved that natural landform says paragraph april mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos when they recieved the photo revealed natural landform the picture showed the martian equivalent butte mesa which are landforms common around the american west the face was proved natural landform the end third reason because the face looks like landforms earth paragraph states what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa which are landforms common around the amercian west this tells that the face common and not shockingly new landform also paragraph says reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho which lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars the face obviously not new thing because earth has landform very similar landforms are made naturally and takes many years start noticing the changes landform some people might say that aliens are real and that over the years they have been working this landform they could also say that nasa rarely goes over the face because hard find nasa never sees the aliens because this reason this all true except that aliens are real there true proof knowing aliens are real not but they most likely aren also nasa has proved that the face isn new landform but that similar many landforms earth conclusion the face mars just natural landform believe that the face mars natural landform because aliens not exist nasa has proved that natural landform and looks like landforms earth,4
the electoral college system that must changed system that takes away the people vote sense originated from the founding fathers well outdated system that could have drastic overhaul the electoral college could thought ruining portions this democracy granting the people vote for president there could great error introduced such way selecting people for such positions therefore stand vehemently the side that the electoral college must change granting the people and the government cleaner more reliable form election three contentions removes the thought there being improper ratio electoral votes popular votes too easy for fraud occur the system and because how irrational and unfair the first reason why the electoral college must changed favor popular vote system because how there such margin error introduced its existence the opposition may argue that popular voting system may have equal not greater chance error but that very inaccurate popular voting scenario things are about basic possible election results are taken directly from the people each state and the results are then combined and compared turn selecting someone into office contrast the electoral college far more complicated resulting more things wrong for instance notable example the election between gore and bush this scenario gore received larger number popular votes bush won the electoral college the whole practice the electoral college introduces many variables the equation that would just very irrational use such system continuing the next reason why the popular voting system should replace the electoral college the chance fraud such form election the members the electoral college could anyone now this may not thought fraud however could well thought fraud the system these members the college could potentially curve the results election for instance the election members did not stay true the one candidate resulting the possibility for improper ratio votes between the electoral college and the populus counter this argument may how often this sort thing may occur the election was the first election since that had similar problem however this sort thing should never occur there should never occasion problem occuring something substantial presidential election final contention regarding how irrational and unfair the entire electoral college this there type winner take all system set place this means that most states candidate wins the state they take the electoral college for the state because this candidates mainly focus campaigning states that they have clear chance winning this extremely unfair for many voters the states that these candidates not even visit they would have evidence what vote election this could also change election with disastrous results for example the election mere few thousand different votes both ohio and hawaii could have led tie the election ties are often fatal the electoral college system delegations congress determine winner the election counter this claim may how the winner takes all system encourages more campaigning the toss states where close attention set upon the campaigning individuals however this still does not change the fact that other states are not receiving the proper amount campaigning prove fair election summation the electoral college must changed favor popular vote form election three previously stated contentions first provides the chance for there disastrous results election these results may consist there being tie improper ratio popular votes electoral votes seen the election continue second contention regarding how there chance corrupters and disagreement election with the electoral college place anybody could technically become part the college and there may dispute between what member for what candidate and such this could very confusing for the voters and finally the entire system the electoral college plainly unfair and irrational this results the election being unfair certain states that did not receive proper campaigning for particular candidates allows candidates choose which states they would like take part campaigning with all the electoral college jumbled confusing mess election and ornamentation,6
driverless cars are the cars the future humans are getting lazier and lazier and need technology fulfill our needs driverless cars are the perfect solution our laziness they are safer and more reliable than regular cars regular cars pose threat our safety regular cars have driven drivers who aren always paying attention their surroundings driverless cars may sometimes need driven user certain situations the event road work accident the driver must take over the wheel and steer around the hazard companies are working new technology that cars become completely driverless companies are trying put car entertainment systems vehicles the driver entertained few years there will driverless cars there doubt about that just metter when and how they will come about all for driverless cars they are the future automobiles,2
the face mars indeed just natural landform was first recorded when this happened everyone went crazy because they thought was form aliens yet they were incorrect nasa has now said that just natural landform and has evince prove well paragraph talks about how the fce just natural landform saying just rock formation also says that the shadows just give the allocution being face which means the sun has cast shadows the rocks and the way the rocks were formed made the shadows fall the wholes appearing face when really isn paragraph says that there alien monuments proving most thero wrong they found this out taking another photo with better linense they can socom and see what really there doing this they found alie monuments and that just land formation nasa originally belived also paragraph says the face equivariant mesa buttle which means that compare mesa and buttle wich are both natural landforms earth also this paragraph was proven that the rocks were created lava now considered lava dome over all scient now belive that just natural landform and that there aliens ther and that there never was winsted they say just rock formation that was made out lava now considered lava dome also they say just like our natural landforms here earth,3
the author this article demonstrates and tells variety factors that contribute the fact that although venus has several dangers surrounding the idea studying venus worth the pursuit well throughout the passage the author tells the pros and the cons venus has but somehow continues try persuade the reader that more research and studying done will all worth the long run not only does tried persuade the reader with his writing but also includes several facts proven nationwide professional companies and sources the author solely begins reference nasa and how they play role advancing the knowledge venus throughout the course studies uses evidence such venus would allow scientist float above the fray just our jet panes travel higher altitude fly over many storms vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way the text also states temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth not easy conditions but survivable for humans the author includes this give the reader reasonable idea what one the largest space companies has come with begin send humans venus furthering his persuasion continues include details the text about some the innovations many researchers are working that could contribute expanding our knowledge venus following the details nasa and their idea visit venus the author includes evidence about some the many innovations researchers are working along with how nasa contributing help better these innovations the author does very good job describing some the innovations created and how they will help contribute meaningfully our discoveries venus the text states some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chodas venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions the text also states another project looking back old technology called mechanical computer systems that use mechanical parts can made more resistant pressure heat and other forces although the author does very well job trying persuade the reader that studying for venus worthy pursuit completely oppose his idea and what trying claim this article that all the research venus and trying pursuit the idea that will all worth false will not worth and can support answer with several different ideas from the text first the text states spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours this major reason because something like spacecraft made out hard metal with weight couple tons can not survive for more than few hours imagine what could happen with the human body secondly venus provides thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets and contains clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid which the human body exposed can determinate and die instant lastly venus surface the temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what humans currently experience earth these conditions also have the capability liquefy many metals with these kind statistics from the planet venus there realistic survival chance for any human body which why completely oppose what the author this article trying the author this article supported his claim that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers although properly demonstrated why supports furthering studies oppose his idea read the statistics from venus and why furthering investigation this planet would reality pointless this concludes his reasoning behind wanting continue studies along with why chose oppose his idea venus,5
for technology able read the emotional expressions students would very beneficial some students could struggle with verbally expressing their emotion making hard for their teacher learning coach know the most successful way teach them therefore the student starts get bored anxious confused the computer could pick those emotions and make changes the student learning lesson help get them back focus and engage with their learning classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor mental illness rise amongst people general students suffer from too they not indestructible working machines technology being able read emotional expressions students very valuable could help students feel less stressed when working lesson they struggle with without the panicky feeling having talk the teacher about infront the class which could cause anxiety with majority communication being nonverbal can hard understand even for humans technology being able pick would alot easier and not feel intrusive the student having explain themselves the teacher learning coach most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication notes huang computers need understand that too,3
believe that driverless cars are actually bad idea while driverless cars can help with stuff they can also hurt while the car driving without the help humans wont know what when hits construction sites and when imette actions needs taken with the human instincts not there behind the wheel the car will more open collisions and massive wrecks driverless cars may what people think need but they could also mean many more accident related deaths driverless cars they alot help driverless cars can apply brakes steer and can even drive themselves now but that really something you want car while they can drive themselves they can take the same action alert person behind the wheel lets take this for instance your driving down neighbor hood street and kid runs the road alert human can hit the breaks and swerve but car wont able all that fast the driverless cars dont have that quick instinct humans where can jump right into action the sight danger the humans are also capable driving slowly and safely through construction zone where car will just the speed limit registered driverless cars can the jobs humans can behind the wheel when driving with out the humans instincts the cars will more open wrecks well while even with our instincts humans cant avoided all car crashes that happen our life time cant what makes you think car that don have those instincts can either crash can happen blink eye and cant always ready best can hope can apply brakes avoided bathe cullison going around the side thats the problem though going around and avoiding not always option when thats the option you have apply brakes quickly reduce speed that will take atleast little impact away from the crash now cars have breaking system them where they apply breaks when they are close something you are going down the interstate mph and need stop good luck having the car thr time you reach the cars range apply brakes will late driverless cars may what people think need but they are not what need need people start focusing more driving and stop being distracted while driverless cars are becoming popular the more wrecks are increasing along with this new technolgy being built into cars like phones people can call each other this just distracting drivers more and can lead bigger wrecks the future need stop with the smart cars and back phones and cars where humans have drive themselves this driverless cars are step the wrong direction thats view driverless cars dont like them thin they are terrible idea and should stop being made dont want see anyone else getting hurt because they were unfocused while driving these cars will the death many more people then any nother kind driving driverless cars cant what humans can and they will one day worse then drunk driving thats perspective driverless cars dont think they should used all,4
personally think that would bad idea use this kind technology schools help students learn this mainly because errors that the computer could make other outside factors the program makes changes the lesson due facial expressions alone then would make unbelievable amount mistakes case you still aren sure what getting ill explain more detail below first lets just ignore the outside factors and talk about just the flaws telling emotions based completely off facial expressions sure that not alone saying that matter how being taught will without doubt bored detects this then will try switch way teaching that thinks that will enjoy the problem however comes when bored with that way well because would keep switching would almost impossible learn anything due the program changing how the lesson tought every five minutes now lets ignore the problems with the facial recognition not working properly and focus the outside factors that would make putting this our schools disaster lets say that you hate the way currently teaching the lesson then out nowhere you see proper name over the corner fall out his chair and smile meanwhile your computer sitting there thinking boy the human really likes when teach this way and decides teach like that more often well now that kid stuck learning that way until the program can take hint and change now lets explore the opposite effect lets say that the program has been doing amazing job teaching you but your cat died yesterday you are verry sad the program now thinks that doing bad job teaching you and decides cross that method teaching off the list and try another one now you aren learning well you could otherwise conclusion think that would horrible idea utilize this technology our school systems with even one the errors that mentioned would bad idea but with both them happening once they would practically destroying the students educations,3
have you ever heard the unmasking the face mars before well people started making accusations before they got high quality photograph they though was face aliens had made mars that was one the many accusation made about the face mars the face mars just landmark because the face mars located degrees north martian latitude where was winter april a cloudy time year the red planet there big cloudy winter storm when people discovered the face well with all the wind blowing could just been made dirt and rocks and everything blowed into one pile and coincidence been made into face second another reason why the face just landmark because right after the winter storm they got viking photograph the face mars before they can make accusations that into history you have have high quality picture prove you are right they got one picture and that not enough solve something history start making illogical accusations without evidence finally why the face just landmark mars because instead waiting get high quality image they waited years back mars see when they finally did back see the face they had lot better and high quality cameras when they arrived back mars was proven that the called face was just landmark quote the text that makes everything logical what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte landforms common around the american west there you have the face mars was just landmark not alien face see before everyone made illogical accusations they did not have high quality photo and when they first took the photo when was cloudy day nasa correct because before making accusation they went and got evidence prove their thodey,4

the article driverless cars are coming totally against the development these cars one reason why against the driverless car because people may fall asleep while the driverless car switches over manual driving and you may not aware any this another reason why against the driverless car because this car doesn actually have human controlling computer the car can accidentally hit someone then can automatically switch manual driving and might cause another accident and very dangerous one third reason why against driverless cars because this car gives many people chances whatever they want behind the wheel while the computer driving these three examples demonstrate why against driverless cars don lazy when comes driving don fool and buy driverless car,3
who doesn have car now days seems like everyone dominated these four wheeled creation technology the other side many places and countries the world have decided put stop the use cars this idea giving their cars came with many advantages everyone some this benefits are the following when cars are used less left completely unused this helps stop pollution people feel better and improves the economy car users first all the most important advantage that being car free can stop pollution one city that had ban car use for few days paris due all the smug the action that they took stated the article titled paris bans driving due smug monday motorists with even numbered license plates had leave their car home and not use else they would get fine euro which equivalent dollars and the same thing had done for the odd numbered plates the next day the article says the smug cleared enough monday for the ruling french party rescind the ban for odd numbered plates tuesday this shows how much damage the cars cause the air just day there was huge improvement the amount smug demonstration how much can help just taking public transportation and leaving our cars for while addition another benefit that people feel better the source called car free day spinning into big hit bogota has this quote that businessman carlos arturo plaza said good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution and true that cars can cause drivers lot stress for example the simple task driving work the mornings can cause stress because have constantly preoccupied not having accident even hitting pedestrian bogota this measurements has been taken really well the community and has worked just fine taking stress away something are always trying but dont realize how simple can just used our cars less they are cause this stress after all another advantage that improves the economy the car users based personal experience parents can spend over dollars week just buying fuel for our car imagine all the money you can save you didn have spend fuel anymore another very expensive thing than comes with the use cars that when breaks you going have spend hundreds and even thousands dollars the repairs conclude there are many benefits can recieve limiting our car usage three those are the ones talked about can stop pollution and smug can make people feel better and can improve our economy,4
venus earth sister plant other people like call earth twin venus counted earth sister twin planet because how close density and size venus earth scientists have tried and tried explore venus with little robots but the little robots only lasted couple hours venus surface venus believed uch like earth now scientists believe that venus used covered oceans greenline and other type life before earth scientists are worried physically venus themselves because the dangers they will macewen arriving venus venus atmosphere blanketed thick blanket almost there are clouds sulfonic acid temperatures reach least and the atmosphere pressure times greater than earth the author thinks that scientists should get close and personal despite the danger challenges that they fac from venus because could have insights venus wouldn get sample anything shouldn limited exploring just because the dangers should explore the very edges imaginations and innovation,2
this passage the author claims many ways and benefits visiting and exploring our sister planet venus claims that venus the closest planet earth terms density size and the closest earth distance also claims that even though will dangerous and difficult explore venus there are already many scientist trying figure out ways make safe and less risk the authors claims this passage does support the idea studying venus despite the dangers through out this passage the author describes how simula venus earth paragraph states that venus may have once been just like earth long time ago the author states that many astronomers beleive that venus could have once been covered large oceans and could have supported various life forms venus has many features that earth also has venus has features like valleys mountains and craters like earth the author claims that venus can our nearest option visit when space exploration possible would better visit place that could have once been just like earth that close the author claims that many scientist are already finding and testing new and safe ways get close enough venus explore paragraph the author states that nasa has possible solution the hot temperatures venus nasa would make scientist would able float above venus from distance the temperatures would still around degreed fahrenheit but the air pressure would like the sea level earth they would not the easiest conditions work but human would able survive these conditions conclusion the authors claims that the idea studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers good idea the author backs his claim with many facts such venues simulates earth the authors claims support his ideas thoughout the passage,3
the idea using facial recognition technology identify how someone feeling new one also preposterous one you can not fully understand what someone feeling looking their face and attempting invasion their privacy facial action coding systems should not used classrooms the idea that you could fully decipher what someone feeling based how they look absurd you can not decide for yourself how someone feels based the movement their muscles for example someone looks sad you can not just decide that they are sad just because they look that way machine decides look confused does really have the right change what learning understand how someone really feeling you have first ask yourself why they might feeling that way once you understand this then you can determine what happening machine can not read minds confused about one thing the machine does not know what not mention that people often feel varying emotions varying times the day might sad one minute then laugh joke the next might not understand something than understand the next second the machine might automatically change something understood based few seconds confusion this not efficient helpful read someone emotions based their facial expressions invasion their privacy let assume this machine can accurately decipher someone emotions based muscle movement what you don want people know how you feeling confused about something and embarrassed about suddenly the whole word knows should the student decide whether not they want seek help not some magical machine forcing students share private emotions you run the risk making them less willing school who would want school where everyone knows how you feel all times the day that would affect learning severely and would definitely more harm than good hindering learning attempt better understand students not worth using this software classrooms would ineffective and even did work would huge invasion privacy this software should used paintings and nothing more not accurate enough anything other than hold back human learning this software not fit for classrooms,4
according some theories there more than solar system and each one them contains plants and the studies all these solar system and planets rotation around sun there are plants which are aike venus and earth and them being unique makes worth study about venus one the brightest point light the sky and the second planet from the sun also referred earth twin according the author humans have sent numerous spacecraft land this could draped world each previous mission unnamed and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours even though this happend the national aeronautic and space adminsitration has been compelling ideas for sending humans study venus and make possible for them come backe venus has different enviroment earth more hotter and more more pressure which also makes hard survive but still has some features that are analogous those earth the plant just like earth with rocky sediments valleys and mountain the nasa has been working projects like looking back old technology called mechanical computers which were envisioned the and were used during world war nasa and other scientist are woking really hard that could recall the venus can sometimes our nearest option and also can safe and survive there too the author believe that should not scared have limits our thoughts becuase danger and doubts but should expand meet the very edge our imagination and innovation studying more about venus worth have any problems earth always know that have another option could move too other plants like the venus studying more about vetus could help nasa achieve they goal landing venus safely and making some machines that could last long enough contribute meaningful our knowledge venus groping through and bearing the heat and air temperature the venus,3
the author have lots facts and think needs add his ideas people can see what thinks think venus cool but didn know that was that close the planet earth also feel like people dont find facts fun because people dont want know all the fact and can see this could happen like longer and would alive would not because would salote money planet and would miss the planet earth yes the author did support this idea but could add more his ideas because dont really understand you could live because how would you get food water pets and have fun venus and people would also motley dupes and fat because people are not going outside play and you cant talk enone and the spacecraft was unmanned and for good reason then dont think this not going happen eny time soon,1

the new technology called facial action coding system should should used classroom read the emotional expressions the students why you make ask belive will actually rise the students smartness and test scores also would the best for years come will hpl the students more smart becasue classroom there are kids that are scared embarassed rise their hand and ask questions the teacher see student confused and sees that kid sacred rise their hand then would explain what was teaching then the technology shows she isnt confused then would move this will great years come because kids wouldnt left behind and wouldnt feel that they have drop out they will see their self being something big the futter then will have more doctors and mostly likely find new medics for illness like cancer will get inocentes help live this earth longer and maybe hopefully keep the earth clean they would smart enough find new ways keep the earth clean not even just help the earth but help kids prevent from doing things that will harm themself and others for example the teacher sees somone mad they can try help and talk and that could help school shooting because sometimes all need someone talk conclusive belive the new technology called facial action coding system should the classroom because will help the earth and thw world but mot importantly humans,2
using the new facial action coding system would great for student use the classroom for the number reasons one the teacher gets know the students are paying attentions two the teacher gets know the students are understanding what she teaching and three the students are communicate with the teacher with just looking something and not even doing anything else the teachers need know the students are paying attention the lesion for start this program would good schools across the world students can tend stare off and get distracted with other stuff and with simple scan the teacher would know and can tell them get back task maybe they are having time class finish classwork homework they can know they aren doing and just talking with another student something when teacher teaching they respect the students understanding and they aren they want them ask questions most students don ask questions and for this thing just scan face and tell they are confused can help more students pass the classes they are this program basically going encourage students participate more students sometimes are afraid put their hand and ask questions this program could possible tell when they have question states the text can read the major muscles the face which good nothing won get hidden from the coding system conclusion have stated why think this facial action coding sytem that can detect human emotions good the classroom stated that the teachers need know students are paying attention students are understanding what the teacher teaching and students being able communicate with the teachers,3
the government claims they are for the people which the electoral colledge corrupt considering that every state doesnt have the same amount votes even thoe president can get majority vote wont matter because the other president has more votes according the electoral colledge your not even voting for the president your voting for state electors then they elect the president how you know that they are going vote for your pacific president this shows that simple system can rigged for failure sorce paragraph shoes that certain electors refused vote for there partys president popular vote simpler less fool proof system and should considered the government rully for the people the electoral colledge very sensitive system and alot can rong vary easley knowing that your vote might not actually matter can frustrating because your relying nother person vote for that president the people should change the system from electoral colledge popular vote its only fair the citizens that actually vote and its more fool proof sure they say that corruption happens vary rarely this system but you cant simply trust somebody word like that expressly now days its scary how you have vote for state vote for you chosen president its just longer more complicated system that can get messed easley election for the president big deal our president has the biggest role the country and cant rely electoral colledge because can easley corrupt damaged than that could screw the whole country over think should change popular vote because stands more for the people and more fool proof and can work better for number reasons hope the state senior wold able take this idea and make work,3
the electoral college process that has been used the united states government for many years the process that selects candidate for presidency based electoral votes rather than the popular vote the people many believe that the electoral college should abolished but were take out our governmental system would take away most the effectiveness our elections the united states election process has worked very efficiently for many years with this process election very effective for choosing candidate and when comes down the last process the electoral college house representatives stepping when there tie very unbiased and also effective choosing candidate were abolish the electoral college the united states government would basically starting over with their election process which isn necessarily good idea once you are nearly years into being official country the united states election process has worked very effectively with the electoral college for large amount years there reason why should abolished from the country throughout all these elections the best candidate was chosen for each presidency the end because this great process election rather than choosing the majority the people which could have biased opinion left both the citizens and vote congress this forms balance between the two opinions very evenly based system said source defense the electoral college five reasons keep our reprised methos choosing the president the article states that the electoral college requires presidential candidate have trans regional appeal this means that just having one region the united states really respect you and vote for you this does not mean you are going win the election region can get you the win there simply are not enough electoral votes therefore you must cover the most ground possible the united states because the more states you win over the better your chances becoming president are the electoral college very efficient process election instead only the people voting and the decision who becomes president left the popular vote the power selection for presidency evenly spread between congress and the people some say that the electoral college unfair and that irrational this stated the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong written bradford plumer states the best arguments favor are mostly assertions without much basis reality this means plumer believes that those who argue favor the electoral college not take look the reality things when talking about this subject the electoral college very fair when comes the election president because all want choose the best candidate for the job and the only way that have effective system for choosing candidate without having biased opinion tossed into the mix mess the process sort like job interview you show what you have offer the boss this case the whole country and you are chosen for the job that means you were the most qualified and that you are the best choice for the job whichever candidate gets chosen for the job was obviously the best candidate the time and there nothing that anyone can change that the one situation that most people worry about within the electoral college when there tie the electoral vote this situation the decision the election would placed into the hands the house representatives and the senate chooses the vice presidential candidate best suited for the job does not matter how many representatives there are for any one state stated the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong bradford plumer states that because each state casts only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing voters would have much say the representatives from california representing million voters this means that state has more power than another this process and every representative has the same amount power when comes down choosing candidate best suited for being president additionally creates sense balance between all the states and nobody has unfair advantage when electing the next president you can see the electoral college very effective process used the united states choose presidential candidate that should not abolished from the country with this system the country has functioned very effectively for very long time the system very effective for choosing candidate best suited for the presidential position and very unbiased and fair when comes down the decision the house representatives for the election abolishing this efficient process would just disservice the country election process and highly doubt that any whole hearted citizen the united states america would want that his her own home country,6
dealing with the face and researching own feel very confident say that not made aliens reasons being that you see what looks like face wall maybe even curtain something that sort does mean that created some alien another unrealistic being article read said that the scientist believe and then said that the theorist believe question are you going believe theorist someone who probably hasn even seen person over someone who has probably examined the face over thousand times trying come with something reasonable and real evidence give the people scientist said that believed that was mesa butte yes true that the government could hiding aliens and their having the scientist just say that for there sack but likely the scientist have said that they think they actually seen somewhere maybe there not liesing and seriously just mesa butte garvin man who went see the face has said reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho and has also said that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same hight the face mars does that seriously sound like liesing hes actually seen and studied and everything and has reason lie about but your decison you can believe him you can believe the theorist the article read gave lots reasons why wasn alien face that was just nature being nature and the way the put was very informative and told that was defiantly just nature being nature while ending this would like say that yes believe the scientist that the landform looking like rock was just mesa butte but what really know not scientist but still answer the question yourself you believe the scientist you believe the theorist,3
have never liked government intervention depictions that should left the people who feel the effect mandate however government intervention limiting the amount car usage may prove genuinely good cause may prove accomplish what government was first formed help shape the world make better place exist not only with each other but with the whole earth fist may seem little crazy our day and age actually reverse the climb our use technology and innovation like vehicles after all isn that what supposed isn natural constantly evolve time passes well cars aren natural and they destroy what are facing dangerous pollution after days near record pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city source this alarming and many people who care for the earth every day facing new headlines negativity and although whether kim kardashian dress fits not upsetting think need focus more important things and expell the negativity always bashed with could developing things that will really make impact like new breakthrough sciences space medical sciences and much more instead all our development since world war has been centered the car and that will have change source but there hope all this already seeing improvements the number miles driven the united states peaked and dropped steadily thereafter according analysis doug short advisor perspectives investment research company source maybe reversing the climb our use cars isn hard after all can hit the ground running reduction the ownership cars has also shown surprising improvement psychological well being vauban germany they have almost completely cut out automobile use their community when had car was always tense much happier this way said heidrun walter media trainer and mother two she walked verdant streets where the swish bicycles and the chatter wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor source sounds like people can much happier without the constant buzz cars coming and going the mention children also makes think that would much safer environment raise children without the stress parents having worry their children would safe with many cars about think everyone remembers their parents telling them time and time again look both ways before crossing and then double check and then hold their hand and watch out for right turning traffic reduction automobile use this case directly related the stress parents have over their children when doing something simple crossing the street addition reduction automobile use and ownership gives the local government something more beneficial focus rather than spending millions paving roads parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced broad smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped source with this change local government can focus really improving the standard living more job openings with more businesses easier travel despite what one might think during rush hour and higher level general safety with less danger car accidents all all think will hard transition through government does plan get involved the reduction car usage easy make bad habits but hard break them however succeed will see huge improvement the environment and the standard living and will really worth these are not views opinions these are facts,4
this discussion will discuss the positive and negative aspects driverless cars with the article hand will show you what details support these both arguments aspects driverless cars the positive aspects the car are that the car will can autopilot for you here this article says they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents the another positive aspects this driverless cars are that can save fuel half today taxis and offer more flexibility than bus will save money for building another car perhaps save fuel for the world for the ability move around much more than the bus can time saver anyone rush the negative aspects the car that what the technology fails and whose fault that the driver the manufacturer fault here the article says still even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident the technology fails and someone injured who fault that the driver the manufacturer the another negative aspects that still cost millions dollars build this new technology car here this article says that the sensors weren there the computers weren there and the mapping wasn there wasn something you could buy radio shack conclusion that must wait till the development reaches safety level even commercial the world,2
the story the author says the rightist planet space and every space craft has been frailer that has landed and they have acid clouds and your head can explode and super super hot hooter than the sun even and they have very big storms and lightnin stikes even though very simile earth still very different meany ways even not being the planet and just chillin above you can still die but its hard even study from above because how dens the planet but they are finding ways their but still very hard study the planet think the way the author puts good they talk about how looks like earth like have revans rocks lakes and more but they also explain how bad the conditons are their even though dont really care about space that much think would cool because for all know venus could had life some point life their could bones some kind their still life that would very cool thats conclusion,1
fellow citizens pollution the big buzz these days ecofriendly supplies are increasing people want quite cars are being created electrical polluting gases solar power electricity ever since were younger people drove attention limiting car use any possible way like carpooling riding the bus riding bikes walking etc what this craze about limiting car usage vauban germany you can say there life the fast lane all life peaceful result pecent families vauban not own cars heidrun walters says when had car was always tense much happier this way walters walks verdant streets there were swish bicycles and the chatter wandering children drowning out the occasional distant motor paris there not much peace life the fast lane its city congestion after pollution measures reached record high paris banned driving clear the smog cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer air trap car emissions monday motorists with even numbered licence plates were ordered leave their cars home suffer dollar fine the same would apply odd numbered plates the following day the smog eventually cleared enough release the ban for odd numbered plates tuesday while america after with the number miles driven peaked thereafter that number steadily dropped does this mean america love affair with its vehicles seem cooling probably not but april the number miles driven per person was nearly percent below the peak equal where the country was the explanation greatly because cash strapped americans could not afford new cars now because america recovery recession and unemployment noticing the next few years ahead therefore limiting car usage can either accident emergency spaceage celebration choice either way limiting car use great for our environment and great for your skin,2
think that the use this technology read the emotional expressions students real say this because you look into the computer and have emotion your face will tell you what facial expression you are showing for example your looking mean then the computer will think that your angry this moment just how people can look you and tell how your feeling the new technology can the new technology did not work describe people expression then the computer would not anything computers are smart technology and can lots things good idea read the emotional expressions students because computers know how your feeling once you look into figure out how your feeling the computer will take picture model your face the new technology could only tell six emotions which are happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness the expressions people make are very universal the new technology can not describe how your feeling your not showing emotion you smile while ads come the computer while assume that your demonstrating the mona lisa facial expression because your smiling and thats what they she wanted you they wanted bring smile your face last but not least think that the use this technology read the emotional expressions students real say this because you look into the computer and have emotion your face will tell you what facial expression you are showing for example your looking mean the computer will think that your angry this moment just how people can look you and tell how your feeling the new technolgy can the new technology did not work describe people expression then the computer would not anything computers are smart technology and can anything,3
scientists great lengths try learn more about the world around whether through rockets that into outer space simple lab experiments they are willing spend large amount money achieve their scientific goals the author also believes that scientists should invest the advancement scientific knowledge the author the article the challenge exploring venus believes that venus should pursued despite its many dangers the author supports this idea through the use technology the planet future desires and earth and venus similarity support his idea well the author supports his claim through the use explaining how venus somewhat similar earth says astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system says this that humans will become curious about these features and will want learn more about venus continues writing long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the author uses this quote make people more curious about what had happened all the life venus this can make more people want study and learn about venus then the author compares venus and earth today saying today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters explaining what currently there and trying increase people interest with venus thus the author uses venus similarity earth make people wonder what had happened make how today convince others and support his idea that venus worth pursuing addition that the author also uses the advancement technology support the idea writes nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray through this saying that were presure venus may also make advance technology and develop new things such this blimp like structure also mentions that solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels this means that some the solar power may harnessed from the atmosphere venus and used for other uses such powering some technology also says many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus therefore humans discover and invent machines that can last long enough know would have this technology for further use and can continue advance the future which this helps justify his desire for the continuing study venus the author also uses earth future desires and wants try support this idea tries make imagine how venus could useful the future space travel due its proximity earth writes furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel believes that venus can and should used long term space travel therefore must continue try study the author also believes that the world should continue perse venus because human and their want for more knowledge the author writes striving meet the challenge present venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors uses fact that humans will eventually come another problem that they can not solve believes that they should not just stop trying but that humans must adapt and try advance technology get past these endeavors this exemplified when says our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation therefore the author uses humans desires continue gain knowledge and future explain why the planet should continue its investment venus conclusion the author supports his idea that venus worthy pursuit despite its dangers supported myriad reasons and has good amount supporting evidence his support effective due him explaining the benefits our continuation making technological advances the fact that may encounter future problems done the road and the scientific reasons study venus therefore the support uses good and makes good argument about why the planet should continue perse venus,5
world with driverless cars would very simple world with newer and more advanced technology being invented everyday gets safer well although driverless cars are not completely driverless yet still great start amazing future new driver meaning that just learning how drive and have admit not easy looks think would wonderful live time period that has driverless cars least able witness them being made the majority our cars now are already operated computer systems even though humans the majority the work required control car the human kind whole isn always the keenest when comes being aware our surroundings and being able have car that allows pay more attention without actually doing anything could take away lot the pressure for drivers especially teen drivers fuel consumption has always been and probably always will one the top issues associated with cars and driving but with the creation these new driverless cars the amount fuel consumption should down according google cofounder sergey brin the health our planet major concern and having millions maybe even billions cars letting out gas not making better can create car that requires less fuel which means produce less gas into the air then that one thing can check off the list things destroying earth sensors and lasers are also great contributions the completion driverless cars although they would course still require the driver stand the energy operate and drive the car would done the car itself technogym continuously advancing and even faster pace getting hard keep time all driving cars that don actually require drive sebastian thrun seems have the same idea considering that just the time frame the created gps computers laptops and touchscreen cellphones paragraph eight asks why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive think these are great questions know that new driver would totally miss not being able drive why not create car that gives you the option deciding you want the car drive itself you want drive course one likes traffic and who likes hour car rides florida these could the times that the car would drive itself all all driverless cars could one the many successes man kind but safety still issue great thing able come with the idea create things such driverless cars but even better know your the one who perfected the idea and turned into reality are living reality innovative generation that only just getting started can wait see what happens next maybe car will flying then too,5
first all will agree with the development driverless cars all know that the technique improving the new technique shows the good way them serve the driverless cars one these new techniques the driverless cars will help lot different ways for example the driverless cars will improve the safety cars can let the drivers have time sleep the long term travel also can help old man childen drive the car will really helpful will more popular than the old car than are using now the technique driverless cars improved and don need human driver anymore that good news for old people childen because they don need drive all the computer will fix all the problems the article talking about the driverless car still waiting for the law there are few states allowing the driverless car that good start the future there will more states and more counties allow the driverless car the article also talking about the driverless car bad way still not really safty yet know the driverless car not safety yet but should give the driverless car some time improve believe the future the driverless car will more safty than normal cars because the normal cars are control humans humans will make mistakes for example the long term drive the driver will really sleepy maybe the driver will take phone call when the driving but the computer will not tired better than the human drivers but should give them some time improve the driverless car the technique the driverless car still importing now think the technique will progress and become well done some day that time the technique have already grow and will lot save than human control cars maybe now the driverless car are still have lot questions but the future the driverless car will more safty more common and more confortable think the driverless cars will have great development the future,3
the article driverless cars are coming the author presents both positive and negative aspects driverless cars for one all for the development smart cars look forward time when one buys cars becasue one needs them anymore belief that that the development the smart car could help great deal the forseen future are already our way towards the idea driverless car not only becoming real but also helping our deteriorating planet you see believe that since even though there are few vehicles now that don necessarily need gas run there are far more that than not our vehicles now adays alot damage our ecosystem than most realize seem care for sooner later that invisible wall that shields the sun light which burns brighter than any fire known man will instead helping create life will destroy there much pollution the air now because our nonexistent will protect that which live instead slowly killing now clear any misinterpretation must state that way tree hugger but believe that must something about this pollution instead sitting back and watch the dreaded show death that one the reason why all fro the development driverless cars for believe that this idea will bring few steps closer vehicles that have need gas any other polluting resources our deposition this said believe driverless cars could also helps getting things faster already most cars nowadays cars have apps stalled that allow not take our eyes twe road while the same time things that feel need time sadly common thing these days for everyone have some kind bussy schedules since are children our kids now school for most the day then get home and their homework school clubs athletics they signed for yet don really want becasue their parents are the ones who dont want them out the house all because they have work late and won home till late are bussy doing other things that they can take care their children all day they send them taken care someone else this the product filled schedules which are made easier handle now smart cars the technology installed them making possible multitask while driving and able not waste time making easier finish the list things done now most driving laws presented the article are written the assumption the only safe car has human driver control although opinion that not the case most occassions believe that most car accidents are caused because drunk driver because driver losing control all these accidents could avoided smart car the way see that the future the way are going with technology will lead safer car where difficult situation you could guided your smart car completely driverless cars could kind auto pilot certain situations for instance person decided out with couple friends and decides that although completely irrational idea drive home course with simple click button could all avoid could horrific accident,4
driverless cars seem like neat and fun idea but they are not great they seem driverless cars can dangerous and are not more efficient then normal car these cars seem have many good things about them but actually have plenty negative effects the driverless cars ahold not developed driverless cars are not practical because the cars are not driverless the driverless cars can only alone mph conditions the car also can not alone traffic near construction stated paragraph the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires the human the car can not even relax while the car drives itself because she must still watch the road and ready drive when the car can not then the driver will nervous waiting for their turn drive when time the driver will just feel much more stressed not better for the driver just drive all times and avoid stress about getting the wheel time some might say that the driverless cars are great because you are much safer them these cars have lot new and smart technology that helps making car trip much safer for the driver and its passengers also allows the driver multitask while the car drives drivers can their phones finish their hair and makeup when the driver tough situation they can just let their cars get through and take back the wheel whenever she ready the driverless cars are not safe they seem with all its technology the number one reason people get into car crashes because they were distracted usally their phones and encouraging drivers their phones driverless car very dangerous with these new cars will very hard try and even multitask since they are not self efficient the driver must pay attention the road all times therefore making very hard safely turn around and something else drivers when trying something hurry will have leave what they are doing attend the wheel when the car can longer drive since the car will only able drive specific conditions the driver must attend the wheel constantly the driverless cars are fact not driverless and beat their own and only purpose these cars have many negative sides them and should definitely not take the place normal and safe cars driverless cars should not developed car manufacturers,4
the article the challenge exploring venus the author thought how could research and study venus without any casulties during the expédition paragraph has clamped that venus has thick atmosphere carbon dioxide with its atmospheric pressure being times greater having the hottest surface and its venusian weather presenting additional impediments including erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes the author could claimed that venus itself worthy pursuit because had stated that astronomers are fascinated also because had once been the most earth like planet the solar system paragraph the paragraph had stated that venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have been supporting various forms life like earth was doing venus has surface rocky sediment and includes some interesting features like valleys mountains and craters this led question how would astronomers study the planet order for the author find solution the problem should read the paragraph talking about nasa paragraph nasa one possible solution make vehicle hovering over venus avoid its major disaster conditions the air pressure would close its landscape far the sea level earth hope that this information should good enough for the author used doing some kind project and wish him good luck,3
dear senator thank you for taking the time read letter would like bring something your attention that has been mind recently think the electoral college important picking our presidents and think that needs stay apart our voting process the electoral college our history and the founding fathers didnt put there just removed the electoral college needs stay apart our voting process beause always have the certainty outcomes everyone presidents and avoids run off elections with electoral college always have the certainty outcomes because the winning canidate share electoral college invariably exceeds his share the popular vote also its highly unlikely for tie the electoral college unlike popularity the electoral college everyone president this such big part because the electoral college requires presidental candidate have trans regional appeal region has enough electoral votes elect president candidate with only regional appeal unlikely successful president the electoral college avoids the problem elections which candidate receives majority the votes cast there pressure for run off elections when candidate wins majority the votes cast that pressure which would greatly complicate the presidental election process reduced the electoral college conclusion the electoral college great thing for the united states and states its very much what our founding fathers intended and should never take away its neccessary and needed voting for presidents,3
driverless cars are coming faster than expected they say there one that being relased this year this the case will driverless about percent the time the only time the driver will need drive around road work and accidents the first completely driverless car estimated relased around think that the driverless cars will wonders the world the reason think that driverless cars will good thing there could less accidents around the world the main reason have wrecks because its mostly the person driving the car not paying attention driverless cars will always have eye the road senses danger its going cautiously and warn you the danger another reason think driverless cars are good idea will save more fuel the long run driverless cars will more than likley run battery and solor power run that also means that they will cause lot less pollution the atmosphere the last reason think driverless cars will hit will fun use them just think can have driverless cars what else could put them they could have bullit wifi coffie makers and can even make them self starting just think the endless possiblities that could happen those are the reason think should continue develop driverless cars less accidents higher fuel savings and the endless possibilites that come with you dont think should devol driverless cars read this and sure will change your mind the matter hand,3
there are still some disputes about the true identity and origin the face mars most likely just natural landform but some people disagree some people believe that was created aliens however since there legit proof aliens even being real how could you prove that they did this nasa also has high resolution photographs that make pretty clear that just natural landform may have taken several tries collect all the needed data back this but the scientists did now know briefly mentioned before there proof alien life actually existing then why are people convinced that was aliens yes may have strange shape but that doesn mean anything there are strange shaped things here earth but people don accuse being alien now understand that this space and different planet but still there are way more logical explanations normal for there landforms planets that simply the deal here the scientists also collected high resolution photos the face when the best photo was taken was made clear that this was just landform similar some the american west was just formation that looked suspicious from far away you looked the zoomed picture just looks like jumble rocks people just need think realistically there however couple small reasons why people see possibility this being done aliens one the pictures was taken from behind small wispy cloud this gave some people enough reason believe that there could alien markings hidden the haze another reason people have for believing this extraterrestrial work that there have been some unexplainable sightings and findings that may point alien life existing there actual facts proof but enough has happened without logical explanations convince certain people this theory respectfully refute these points the idea alien markings being hidden stretch there was even clear picture taken more recently that showed alien markings proved that was just landform there really not that much more response the few unexplainable things that may point alien life have way tell what really out there there something then doing pretty good job staying hidden undiscovered because have cold hard proof anything for some things there are just logical answers there always going something don know probably the most reasonable just stick the facts already have and learn accept the most likely stories yes okay believe hope that there something out there but people should also realize that they need think reasonably certain matters especially when there proof like this case this very strong argument there are many ways that person could keep going and explaining each detail its full extent but think all the most important information has already been mentioned people should accept the facts there always going someone who disagrees but every argument like that there way more proof pointing the conclusion that the face just landform you might still think something different but think made clear why have much reason believe what believe,5
the years does the evolution automobiles and the effect carries our environment technology changes the way move and interact with one another some for the better and others for the worst limiting car usage will help individuals carry themselves their environment because will cause less pollution and less accidents earth atmosphere slowly starting change due the fact that chemicals and gases are being released from your very own car amercian population increases the risk the the greenhouse gases resulting global warming and the lost some habitats the pattern persists will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation the second largest source america emissions just behind power plants rosenthal stopping the usage cars our society will help protect not only ourselves but also the lives those with whom you share with imagine lossing your loved one car accident and never hearing from her him again amercian population starts increase those migration stream resulting manufacturing and labor cost more cars are being released into our living the lives those which care will soon never seen again limiting the usage cars with help keep our enviroment society accident free and see those familar faces which saw grew parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced broad sooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restuarant and upscale shopping districts have cropped selsky day without car will help the lives many epically those around you when technology changes does our ideas and perspective our surroundings congestion causes stress and reduces the chance clear sky car usage changes the lives many well impacts what care about and what don care about limiting car usage will help individuals carry themselves their environment because will cause less pollution and less accidents,3
the use this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable because student can know what other people are feeling just taking picture the text states that using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements real face this mean that this huang can take picture and can tell how you friend are feeling another example the text its states that weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions this means that when someone takes picture paints one you they can tell you are happy sad margy worried devean scared final example that the text its states theory emotions moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also many even produce them this means that even you don feel emotions than they can change that for you feel more happy even sad conclusion these doctors can just take painting picture something and can tell what your feeling think that this valuable the student because gives chance see people where feeling back the day,2
human emotion once about feelings and expression can now calculated and recognized computer were math problem stated the article making mona lisa smile nick alto there new technology created prof thomas huang way improve the relationship between computers and humans meaning ads and websites would able assess the user and adjust what shown depending the emotions the human the example given the article you smile when web appears your crean similiar might follow but you frown the next will different alto not only this device useful the world marketing but may also use classroom the facial action coding system facs would have great value the way teachers and students communicate way improve the education students and the way teachers teach though there are many pros and cons this given situation done right this device could help students greatly begin the use facs would wonderful way help students and teachers communicate indirectly this would done through computer that could analyze the movement the muscles the face identify the six basic emotions happiness surprise disgust fear and sadness classroom setting whether during assignment lecture teachers would able use facs read the emotional response the students help determine their thoughts the given subject this could allow teachers improve and change the way they things order better the students educational experience addition this technology could utilized keep students honest the classroom expecially assignments and tests the complexity facs able read mixed emotions which would allow teachers build understanding their students and help the teachers find way relate the students also counselor may also able help students more efficiently with the use this device they would able read the emotions students help them determine the mental and emotional state students though all these pros seem good paper there are also many cons that come with ultimately quite clear that this device may seem intrusive some people stated the article using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements alto this technology would able use videos track facial movements and determine how people feel some students may think that their rights are being violated with the use facs students may not want teachers know how they feel especially the feeling negative however alto states humans perform this same impressive calculation every day alto meaning people naturally utilize the function decoding emotion most likely not that difficult determine how someone feels current technology there are fingerprint scans and facial recognition that essentially have the same purpose the end this device may not intrusive people may think overall using the facial action coding system would benefit many people within the school system teachers would able connect with students and determine whether their teaching methods are working not this would then improve the education that the students receive and result happier classroom environment and better grades the facs understanding and analyzing emotion may eventually lead the improvement education and the attitudes students have towards school,4
the introduction the author describing venus and explaining how the evening star the nickname but beyond that paragraph and wasn explaining why you should pursuit however one statement that does paragraph venus the closest planet earth terms density and size meaning not that far away reach yet one paragraph that arguing with wanting venus each previous mission was unamed and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours however one statement from paragraph that shows that they wan na venus astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system this paragraph also claims that venus was most likely covered with oceans and still supported different forms life paragraph though one the statement claims not easy conditions but survivable for humans stating that venus climate and other factors made being there pain but again for sure possible paragraph well says nasa has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans study venus going little further paragraph just explains that understand more about venus that they would have get much closer and also describes how scientists are working innovations that would make the tech and gear that necessary better and able last longer they are doing because they can understand much when they have evidence paragraph has claims how you should venus whatsoever but instead talking about older tech used the however conclusion paragraph they stated venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors another line that they used our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubt saying that matter how many risks just happen venus perhaps were able get there worry free come back with things didn know from before,2
the viking aircraft that circled and took pictures mars looking for potential landing sports for future aircrafts found shallowly likeness human face mars some scientists believed unnatural and made ancient civilization mars the more reasonable option was that was just another martian mesa which are commonly found the part mars called cydonia nasa has proven the face mars butte mesa common landforms that are found earth april the aircraft mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time the mars orbiter camera team moc took picture with way higher amount resolution than the first one thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl website revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all even after proving the public wrong about this conspiracy many were still not satisfied the face mars located degrees north martian latitude where was winter mars the time when the mars global surveyor flew over cydonia therefore some people believed that the alien markings were hidden the clouds april whatever hope people had that the martian face was made aliens nasa threw away was cloudless summer day cydonia mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look the moc team took extraordinary photo the face million times better than the past two what the picture actually showed the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west conclusion the conspiracy the face mars was yet only conspiracy and proven nasa the picture only showed the equivalent butte mesa according nasa thanks the mars global surveyor which took picture maximum resolution each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo,4
imagine world where people longer control their vehicles the machines they used buy for the pleasure driving and not just get around while playing their phones terrifying right with the idea driverless cars coming into view this modern day and age must pause from imagining the cool idea these automated automobiles and imagine the scary possibilities that very likely could come along too many the people who push for driverless cars only see the idea car coming them without them even having move muscle however these people most likely haven considered the dangers and downfalls the self driving cars with these driverless cars comes the possibility that people will become lazy forget the enjoyment that can come from driving and most importantly create many new risks and dangers the driving world these days many people are already too lazy even walk but imagine people longer even have drive with automated cars becoming possibility many are losing their minds over the idea being able get around without having put forth any effort these people may have learned drive one point but with automated cars they may forget how drive causing huge problems they ever need drive car that can drive itself create these self driving cars will end with entirely new breed lazy people who most likely won drive their car let alone walk the possibility these lazy folks may tragic but easily moved aside the fact that self driving cars will take away the enjoyment driving can bring many years ago idea was romed that would bring the demise horseback travel and this idea was the car since the day the first car was produced driving has brought many people immense pleasure that unrivaled for years people would save their hard earned cash for the newest car just feal the power gentleness had while they crusted the open roads for hours just their car and them now that pleasure being threatened the idea self driving cars with these new cars will longer have this pleasure these self driving cars take away the enjoyment showing off how nice your car handles how fast you can drive the car does the driving and controls the speed taking away the freedom and pleasure once had although losing the enjoyment driving robbery the dangers these new cars heavily out weighs our loss pleasure today dangers driving are things such speeding and lack awareness however the dangers self driving vehicles are much worse when current vehicle the dangers driving are mostly things can prevent such reckless driving and lack attention with self driving cars they could malfunction leaving time correct the vehicle meaning accident even worse such death self driving car having issues the driver may not even away and seconds later could lose their life with human controlled cars have time correct ourself and most the time are aware problems with the vehicle but not with cars don control these possibilities brought self driving cars should seen before make the leap the next generation travel when lazy people enjoyment driving and new dangers are the risk self driving cars should stop and take moment think when see the risks these new vehicles already know that they outweigh the non existant need for self driving cars these self driving cars bring much more negative than positive and disagree with the idea entirely take look people driving this day and age and the answer yes and for self driving cars obviously,4
the electoral college not place harmed its process theurer amendment the the electrola college and amendment should keep were electrola college good place learn about the presidents deserve this dont let walk away from most people runing for president has there own group electors chosen the candidate you not have the right take ower electoral college most use wont this out all use person did not vote the presidential election held every four years tuesday after the first monday november when you vote for president you help choose your state electors most state have winner take all that gets prise for the winning president which why need keep ower electoral college have right vote can help choose state electoral the electoral college consists electoral the amendment gives ower rights can vote you cant take away were electoral college let can what wont can vote just like others have before,1
think they should because the electoral college process not place the founding father established the constitition the compromise between election the president popular vote the electoral college consists electors majority electoral votes required elect the president your state entitles allotment electors equals the number members its congressional delegation one for each memeber the house representatives plus two for your senators each candiate running for president your state has hin her own group electors the electors are generally chosen the candidate political party but state laws vary how how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are the presidential election held every four years the tuesday after the first monday november you help choose your state electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you actually voting for your candidate electors after the presidential election your governor prepares certificate ascertainment siting all the candidates who ran for president your state along with the names their respective electors the certificate ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate your state and shows which electors will represent your state the meeting the electors december the election year your state certificates ascertainment are sent the congres and the national archives part the official records the presidential election under the electoral college system voters not for the president but for state electors who turn elect the president you lived texas for example and and wanted vote for john kerry you vote for slate democatic electors pledged kerry the off chance that those electors won the statewide election they would congress and kerry would get electoral votes who are the electors they can anyone not holding public office depends the state that how works this reason,1
there major debate going the united states about whether not driverless cars should able the roads driverless cars should not allowed the roads with human drivers three reasons driverless cars should not allowed the roads are they don have human react situation they can malfunction and they not have the survival instincts that people have some people think driverless cars are safe because they are able react better than humans however these cars can not react well people driverless car relies sensors hooked the car know its surroundings whereas human can visually see their surroundings and react situation the article driverless cars are coming the author states that the spinning sensor the roof dubbed lidar uses laser beams form constantly updating model the car surroundings cars that rely sensors can completely know what around them many people think that technology reliable that will never malfunction however there have been many cases where technology has given out technology never one hundred percent will fail every once while the author the article driverless cars are coming states the technology fails and someone injured who fault driver manufacture technology can fail even the worst moments you really trust something that could fail emergency many people also believe that car will avoid collisions however car doesn have the survival instincts that human has human will avoid anything that puts their life danger the article driverless cars are commings the author says that none the cars developed far are completely driverless they can steer accelerate and break themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills cars can not navigate conditions tht require human instinct which the cars themselves not have driverless cars should not let out the roads they are put the roads people may have trouble the cars could cause trouble for human drivers the driverless cars can not drive like humans the cars may cause more danger than good for human drivers,3
ufo lands your front yard apart from the screaming you hear beeps and boops you turn the side and see alien standing your doorway opens his mouth and loud alarm sound comes out you open your eyes and then realize was all dream that the only reasonable explanation for you seeing ufo alien this day scientist have not encountered signs life any other planet what makes you think aliens could have created the face mars two decades and half ago scientist discovered face like shape mars was about two miles long scientist claimed was staring the cameras but there was nothing surrounding power tools hammers not even few sculpting tools how would aliens create such thing with alien tools magic powers maybe because was natural formation scientist figured out was just another martian mesa which are frequent around the cydonia according the article the only thing different about this one was that had unusual shadows make look like egyptian pharaoh which made people wild when mars face started its fifteen minutes fame became beloved pop icon was featured movies books and radio talk shows haunted grocery checkout lines for years that when people mostly conspiracy theorists started thinking what aliens formed some scientist even started believe that was alien artifical more research was done scientist took more pictures which were ten times sharper than the first ones and studied them discovering the oblivious that was natural landform there was disappointment all over the place not only for the people but scientist too was mesa natural landform was even compared the middle butte the saler river plain idaho since then the popularity the face has gone downhill maybe one day resurface the social media funny meme that teens will talk about for two weeks tragic,3
state senator wish for you change the electoral college popular vote for the president the united states the electoral college just longer system chosing the president the united states why through longer process instead the states just choosing the president united states the way the electoral college looking just another system why cant have just one system where based popular votes the states instead having the people choosing what the electors should say why not just straight foward vote the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational bob dole right say abolish the electoral college what have richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce and the afl cio all their time agreed abolishing the electoral college they not alone according gallup poll taken shortly after gore over percent voter would prefer direct election the kind have now this year voters can expect another close election which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency but yet the electoral college still has its defenders the single best argument against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state candidates dont spend the time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states during the campaign seventeen states didnt see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didnt get see single campaign anyone has good argument for putting the fate the presidency the hands few swing voters ohio,2
the author supports this idea because brings more than once for instance the beginning the passage the author mentions that the spacecraft has used cameras and other robots the sad part they didn survive more than few hours humans have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the author gives details certain things that should aware doesn just release with one fact and stay with that tells the people about stuff already know about things that aren healthy for humans thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venu atmosphere the antisurface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth humans know what now our bodies will react temperatures like that the author isn sugarcoating anything for humans conclusion this that the author telling the truth despite the dangers like possibly dying before coming within two feet the atmosphere that venus worthy pursuit the only problem how can pursuit have nothing that can make past what the author does here really let know the dangers then explain why like that that really helps because didn have that confused out mind,3
dear mister senator course because this america and because were idiots have problem not taxes not jobs health care its the president how elect the president that the electoral college that changes the way elect our president and lot people don like that being one and think need just have straight forward election course you know the electoral college bunch representatives from every state tha have president mind when they vote the meeting the electors basically mean your not voting for the president directly your voting for the electoral hopefully vote for your canidate that you supposedly voted for this system wrong because unfair those who vote for the other president but still succeed helping the electoral college vote for whatever president they feel like voting for the time this why think should ban becuase isn the fairest smartest way handle the goverment yeah idea created the great founding fathers and yeah convenient way sort and group people like who with who method but there are few things that can problematic like don know say bribery from the president the electoral college mean come not like that hasn happened before like the whole nixon thing and kennedy pretty much cheated his wife with marlyn monroe but this can stopped just with simple petition get rid change the electoral college then this could stop some presidents before agreed with like jimmy carter bob dole and groups like the chamber commerce and the afl cio according source gore didn win because the electoral college even though won the popular vote yeah was created the founding fathers and should respect there great legacy but that was then and this now this coming from the guy who faught for independence and peace but had over slaves himself yeah not much hero voters prefer direct election over electoral college according source please mister senator please make the right choice and choose abolish the electoral college because unfair and calls for corruption the information will tell that more voters will happier with direct election than electoral college isn that what you want whats best for the people can changed you choose ban they may have been the founding fathers the past but who are the fathers today the new founding father mister senator,3
scientist know that the face created something else but someone thinks aliens created don think aliens can that many things could the cause the face mars but sure not aliens scientist have not proven that aliens are even real yet aliens were real scientist would know about and they might try capture one the face would been causes wind the spacecraft could been natural landform the face mars could have been caused the wind when planets rotate could have cause some wind and the wind could start form piles dirt the dirt could have been moved into the shape face the shadows give illusion eye nose and mouth the face didn have any footprints around aliens couldn done earth the wind blows and pollen from one flower goes another dirt mars could blew one area and could form face spacecrafts flying around mars could have cause the face appear the air that blowing out the spacecraft could blown the dirt into piles piles dirt can form since the stagecraft big when the stagecraft takes off could form the face because when air blown out leaves mark spacecraft couldn have left mark the face the fuel the spacecraft could left mark after blasting off mars the face mars could there naturally the third planet from the sun there any volcanoes lava can explode out aliens wouldn come out and randomly make face scare people the face mars must natural because don believe that aliens are real aliens are real probably would have seen one now aliens can alive they were alive they would have find food sometime however the face could have been madd aliens stil shocked that people think they real never seen one before aliens could able fly and they don have touch the ground the could pick the dirt and place where ever they want form the face conclusion still don believe aliens but something had happen mars could been natural landform could been spacecraft flying around mars they world may never know how the face was created but positive that aliens didn create,4
were scientist nasa will not believed alien because most scientists said aliens are not real and think they just made alien face mars maybe when the wind blow the dust trun that face when they goes there they died and their dead body face still there but really interesting because that face really big and image times bigger than pixel size but believed there are not alien the other planets earth because alien are not real but have mesure that have ask more question the smartest scientist and ask about how did that face happen and how are gon na prove about that have ask more question about that too and they said that face look like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were some them don believe because they don see and they just guess that answer but when looked the picture think saw that crown and their face look shiney and that face look destroy don believe aliens but there was some aliens that planet they might made that face too and they hid away from that face wish see that picture for real and take some picture and prove,1

honestly against driverless cars because people are just reckless drivers all together lets say person decides buy driverless car and says the passage they still need their hands the staring weel and they still need pay attention but since called driverless cars the buyer decide trip and night the think driverless car meaning don have look the road dont have hold the steering weel hey can just sleep since driverless free thats must mean that mean dont have the road because just thing self but lets get real here never will there ever car that you will never have pay attention the road but that car comes out then all heck would break loose the streets there would wrecks everywhere because some people are just nieve that their just are careless reckless people car can ever manage run own the author even said the artifical you still need keep your eyes the rawod and thats opinion you,3
should give our cars order live better life that the question everyone mind right now but brainer places all over the world have done this experiment and seems they like the results here are few key points from passages that will help persuade you into joining the idea getting rid cars vauban germany has given their cars for better and healthier life many families vauban have given their cars that percent them don even own car the reason why vauban did this because they realized that passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and more than triple that amount car intensive areas the united states looking the bright side this since there less space for parking stores are placed walk away main street rather than malls along some distant highway you want drive car you can always buy small area for that also comes with house where you can park the car which would have hybrid paris did the same thing that vauban did but different way monday motorist with even numbered license plates were ordered leave their cars home suffer euro fine the same would apply odd numbered plates the following day course there were people who didn obey the new law and where fined and some even had their cars impounded for their reaction the fine however congestion was down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog the only exceptions were plug cars hybrids and cars carrying three more passengers since they didn really affect the pollution much cars that use lot more gas doing this cleared the smog for some time paris fact much the smog cleared that the french party was actually able rescind the ban for odd numbered plates tuesday instead making law bogota colombia created program called car free day where millions colombians hiked biked skated took buses work whatever they had the goal this program was obvious promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators faced fines for the first time two other colombian cities cali and valledupar joined the event having cars except for taxis and busses bogota doing this the parks and sports centers have seen and highly approved this idea and have turned uneven pitted sidewalks into broad smooth sidewalks along with the new improvements new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have appeared conclusion getting rid cars permit even just for day week seems like good idea lots the people mentioned above highly approve this and say that actually makes them lot happier and stress free course the people who don approve this idea are the ones who were fined for driving drive zone all all still recommend this idea things florida start get out hand and must resort something,3
the face mars was just natural landform because when the first original vikings took the photo they could see the face and that was september they saw the face mars photo when the mars global surveyor flew over mars with his mars orbiter camera his team snapped picture ten times shaper then the orginal photo when the photo got back nasa they analyzed there was face show from mars even though you can see much better the the original photo and they took this photo may how did that make big change from now years ago this means there was alien monument from the beginning thats why should have them take pictures mars every year just can see diapered they destroyed could got buried then also could compared the took pictures and see was the same from september may thats what could did,2
have you ever been confused when comes reading and understanding person that you just ultimately can not new technology system has been released give exact percentages persons emotions just looking into camera the facial action coding system was designed decode using some new computer software that can recognize human emotions the test subject the mona lisa painting leonardo vinci has answered many questions when comes what she expressing the facs can valuable classrooms because can help with the studies human anatomy psychology and can help others understand each other calculating another persons emotions can help with understanding human anatomy and psychology classes schools for this software human anatomy has major role and stores similar anatomical information electronic code the research going along with this system shows there are action units within facial structure that signifies the movement one more muscles each the six basic emotions that paul eckman has classified are all associated with the facial muscles important for students know these muscles and learn how they work according eckman your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises eyebrows when you surprised and the orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips show anger this speed technology comes with information that human could but helps students become knowledgable how works society based technology right now and the forefront the younger generations this software should partake students learning emotions are something that are unbelievably hard understand when coming from other people one typically can not tell how person feeling just the way they are looking unless they are close with them personally being able understand someone emotions will benefit them and their surroundings they can get help they are down can have reassurance they think someone mad them students can become more aware each other and can give more support their peers with program like this the most accurate percentages are provided giving description how the person feels the mona lisa for example she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry what other technology can get those numbers the more understatement each other that within society valuable and can potentially create peace amongst all the reason the world such bad place because there that confusion within each other and nobody knows how anyone truly feels students can grasp this concept this entire generation can change the hatred and all come together the years society becoming more and more aware technology making have greater effect the population whole schools technology the greatest way teaching and learning because curriculums can made simpler technology all that will there eventually might well use and understand now the facs can answer many questions about person group and how they live the constant wonder and confusion the world how people feel about each other can come end and create peace this can only begin with the young generations,3
one part thinks that should have driverless cars but another part thinks that shouldn what something goes wrong with the driverless car what the car doesn the way that you want what you crash you just blame the car like its the cars problem the persons problem what your car gets damaged badly can they fix the driverless car and will they have parts for also idea because what you have call someone text someone and its something important think they also good for navigation you could just tell the car where you want and will take you there could probably cause less accidents because its ran computer and usually the people fault foire the accidents but what the computer just stops working does that mean that the car just stops working before they realise the car think that they should have better technology first the technology now amazing but don think computer can smart enough drive car just yet the future definately think that they are going have google cars that drive themselves that opinion the driverless cars,2
think the face mars just face landform because how would aliens make face planet few days later nasa unveiled the image for all see then nasa captioned huge rock formation they didn say nothing about aliens and probably didn even think about aliens after years they finally stopped researching about the face mars think that was just there land formation because don think any person alien could make face planet after the years went you could see the face even more but the only reason why nasa couldn see clear because the aliens markings were hidden haze which says exactly the text perhaps said skeptics alien markings were hidden haze nasa says just don pass over the face very often lot the scientists think that alien artifact which then later the scientists figure was just another martian mesa but this face was little different then the other ones unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh the text says which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth nasa says the face mars was really big then how many years you think took make the face was alien artifact but then again says the text there was alien after all this discovery took nasa years figure what really was and everybody has been talking about for years because this like one time thing you would never see face planet there been much information that wasn aliens and says the text that thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform again there clarifying and making sure that everyone don freak out and just make sure natural landform,3

our generations have many ways transportation some the transportation that are using effecting our ecosystem and causing have very high percentage greenhouse affect some countries are helping stop from the percentage from going germany they have upscale community and they dont use vehicles much their streets are generally forbidden street parks driveways and home garages the new district freiburg passengers are responsible for greenhouse effect europe and some car intensive areas the united states all that due vehicles germany there only two places park large garages and where car owner buys space paris helping also with banning driving because smog they fine even numbered license plates that didnt leave their cars home mondays they were charged euro the same with odd numbered license the next day almost drivers were fined and twenty seven people had their cars impounded due their reactions the fines really helped because the congestion the air went down cold nights and warm days cause the warm layers air that trapped cars emissions diesels make vehicles france compared average for diesel engines the rest western europe they had more smog than the other european capitols bogota colombia they set program have car fre day that led leaving streets the capitol city eerie devoiced traffic jams they had three straight years banning cars only being able use bused and taxis they were permitted for the day without cars the capitol city for their seven million population that day they had millions people hike the colombian mountains bike skates the people took bused work for the first time two other colombian cities cali and valledupar joined the event their day without cars campaign because bogota the conclusion cars and another type vehicles are bad for our environment they are causing have greenhouse effect its polluting our air and ruining our earth soon our president inh the united states going end culture cars why dont all practice not having cars for day like paris and bogota will better for our environment because the congestion our atmosphere bad and almost greenhouse,2
have you ever looked photo someone and wonder how they feel yes well now you can thomas huang form the eckman institute for advance science the university amsterdam all for this facial action coding sytem could show how people long before use felt when getting there picture painted picture taken people could know how family member and friends felt before they past away what could know how animals felt with the facs dont know how people felt back then didn know what they were going through but with the facs could get general idea how they felt that time there life say you had family member that passed away that you never met before but you want know they were happy sad mad person you could use the facs know you dont have hear from someone else wouldnt cool know what animals are feeling this facs could show how humans felt wouldnt you like konow what your pets are feeling your pet was sad and you didnt know but you use the facs you would know and then you and something with your pet keep the happy now you might asking how does this facs work well ehren the computer constructs computer modèle the face all major muscles the model must move like human muscles examples your frontalis pars lateralis muscles when you raise your eyebrows you are suprised your orbicular oris around your mouth tightens your lips show anger these reasons just listed are why support the facs,2
this why for and against the development all the new cars they are making the driverless cars are very interesting and sound like fun you are still driving but your car also driving itself the only thing disagree with when comes the law the person driving and the manufacturer should have fault the person driving should have the most fault for driving recklessly but the car could have done itself also think the cars should aslo tested know what capable doing certain situations the cars should have crash test like the other vehicle they say that they want the cars safe for the people able drive them but how are the cars going safe they are not tested anything the cars are changing while the years they are just getting better and better the cars have very like human minds and what human when they are driving but when there accident body wants take the blame for what happened google can make all this good technology for things like cars and everything but going safe use even though the person driving the car doesn have much they should still have control they should have control over everything their accident not the sensors for the car might work couple times doesn mean they will work all the time the cars are going have camera them watch what the driver doing the camera should see that the driver watching the road while driving the car this why for and against the car,2

think driverless cars sounds fun but good idea don think think that sounds like bad idea and bit reckless driving car human you have control over everything besides the other drivers how fast you which way you turn how close the lines you are somewhat safe this way but cars are still deadly matter how much control you have you need have control over them not robot also paragraph talks about how you will still have navigate through roadwork and accidents and when pulling out driveways what the use your still going have something another would also much more expensive sell and make when that money being wasted could helping getting america out debt for something useful but instead why not spend something not even need paragraph talks about accidents and who would responsible the driver company and the company they could sue the place and depending how bad they can have the whole operation shut down seems like big ordeal that could simply avoided sticking with normal cars they are already dangerous enough with humans control imagine car controlled robot machine,2

today was having argument with buddy this argument was about the face mars both had our own opinions what thought was weer sitting living room the tan couch with the television friend was tall with blonde hair and skinny had brown hair and was average height worked for nasa had seen pictures what was and had proof that was only mesa and was illusion the human eye zeke thought was artifact once living life mars thought nasa was going say was something else people wouldn truly know what was thought nasa was trying keep the dark noone would try and travel there get closer looks and steal there idea zeke thought needed run further studies truely figure out what this was told zeke that was only landform mars and not some alien artifact told him that was mesa which was common this area mars also explained how shadows made look like face and how was all illusion that was visible the human eye they said that this landform was nothing more than landform mars that wasnt what had appeared zeke who was man what said did not believe and wouldn take word for once got idea his head wasn going move for anything did not matter what proof you showed him wouldn believe single word argued with about hours until finally decided that wouldn argue about anymore still told thought his idea was right and was completely wrong told zeke worked for nasa would know way more than does insured him was not alien artifact and was just mesa which looked something wasn and that shouldn stubborn about and just believe knowing zeke didn thnk would even budge course was right and zeke didn sway his answer all offered show him prove had pictures the event and showed him finally could see what saw decided that needed look closer into the pictures came back the next morning and sat down and ate donuts and drank some coffie gave back the pictures and said you know think those pictures didn help change mind all,2
have you ever felt the need communicate with computer personally think valuable have the facial action coding system our computers classrooms although many may disagree but all have our own opinions the reason being for opinion that computer classroom can tell sad probably change mood the time leave that class like the passage said the computers the classroom can tell your sad give different from the one youll get your happy smiling also lets say student sitting the computer bored maybe the that pops may change that for them many students now days dont their work what their supposed because boredom think having computers understand persons emotions mood facial expressions and etc pretty cool you dont know what goes out school cause that persons emotions person and computer can communicate feel like ill help out many ways especially for the shy ones the ones who are always upset people like that dont want talk anyone explained how they feel and holding everything just effects both physically and mentally,2
does anyone remember when google came with the smart glasses that can anything was said the next revolutionary smart item and everyone will either want have well turns out not even half america bought these state the art glasses just the google glasses did not succeed believe the same thing will happen driverless cars not only will they extremely expensive manufacture and buy but they are also completely unecessary there are already smart phones that can read fingerprints and buy anything just with press button correction the press screen also the cars can even possibly labeled unsafe anyone could anywhere because there specific driver nobody control children could drive off anywhere they pleased they felt like doing also stated the passage who will pay for damages and possible hospital bills there are accidents couldn the driver fault because they weren even controlling the car couldn the manufacturers fault because the car worked perfectly for testing right driverless cars may fascinating but they are not good idea for improved way driving first all these vehicles will extremely expensive the united states already trillions dollars debt due many wars and payments and yet still keep spending billions dollars that not have not only will the cars cost lot money make but having remake every single road that these smart cars can drive them will cost even more the amount construction workers that would have paid would shoot numbers through the roof exactly how much would these cars even cost guaranteed the cost buying these cars will not equivalent the average toyota camry honda civic the car may use half the fuel needed for regular cars but they will cost lot more than gas secondly these cars are not necessary they are new they are exciting they are the most ridiculous idea have been considered many machines the work for people and this can result fat america the united states has already been depicted the most unhealthy country these cars can drive themselves anyone could anywhere without driver this correct then possible for child possibly drive the next state they felt like criminals wouldn need getaway driver all they had hop the car and press button this unsafe possibility although the driverless car may seem fun for people who want new way transported completely unecessary and lazy finally the idea driverless cars may contradict with the law stated the article there may some conflict between manufacturers and consumers when comes accidents and road problems there was accident between two smart cars who would pay for the damage difficult point fingers when both cars are driverless and are not controlled person will the manufacturers have warranty for the car will each driver have pay for damages themselves they just broke cell phone does separate insurance come with the car these are questions that need answered manufacturers want their ideas sell conclusion driverless cars are not good idea because they cost money that not there they are unecessary and may even dubbed unsafe and the idea contradicts with many laws different states just the google glasses was bit too much the driverless cars would meet the same unfortunate fate,5
the author supporting this idea very well because the text giving many reason how venus our sister planet but lot hooter than the text they said the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater that what experience our own planet they came with many ideas venus and take test samples example imagine blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape just our jet airplanes travel higher altitude fly over many storms going very dangerous job the planet because they can not take samples from distance they have take samples the planet going one the biggest challenges they will ever have but they want know what like venus they going for everyone and the people this world,2
personally think that there should electoral college vote not only does keep the popularity vote out check but also holds good amount personality behind the fact that carries over years tradition divide that years per term president thats over presidents that have won their electoral college votes they used the popularity vote would insane the people realize what they are talking about could billions dollars out our debt hole were our spending habits these presidents have had over the past years have lead into doing surprised were all still alive honestly different candidates have different ways planning their lives office their daily commutes their daily functions what laws they are going put into place next the next time that they will make public appearence those kind things but when theyre talking about taking electoral college out play because its outdated personally would say throw them box loony toon cereal dont believe throwing out something our founding fathers came with expecially now that have many our constitutional rights going out play and being laid rest for the many years that they helped serve justice and made actually realize our country went war fight for our freedom thats basically taking away our freedom have who think best office everybody talks about both candidates the popularity war also wouldnt work because they talk about both them equally another citizen would,2

think that the author who wrote this right about studying venus despite the dangers presents say this because the text mention that that not long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have various forms life this makes think that start studying about venus and get enough information need know there form life venus could fnd many things about this planet and maybe make life there also believe that were find interesting information about venus would have send some type living organism prove that could have some type life somewhere other than earth first think would have rough time finding ways life venus but think that are able something like this and succeed believe that can succeed but there will obstacles the way like the radiation would not exceed like earshot leves such the temperatures would warmer then here earth they are many things that would not have human being survive but the other than there few things that have possibility life the text had menton that conditions like venus are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth next some positive evidence prove the statement this author would venus may once have been the most earth like they refer that out all the planets have venus the only one that has similar things earth which there could chance life venus would allow scientist float above the fray venus could our nearest option for planetary visit how text stated believe would and could happen tried lastly the text have seen good and bad evidence prove the authors statement but have not mention that venusians value not only because the insights but because human curiously will likely lead many quality intimidating endeavors human can bring something this research conclusion think that the author right about studying venus even though have cons about doing this still believed that were something like this wouldnt succeed the first time but with effort can and find ways life venus,3
driverless cars are great investment and idea for our country encourage not only the cut down fuel usage but also reduce the number accidents the futuristic automobiles could revolutionize the country driverless cars are fantastic idea and could create several benefits for the country driverless cars have the potentiel drastically reduce fuel usage the opening paragraph the article the author states the cars forsees would use half the fuel today taxis less fuel used for automobiles would empower the united states spend less money oil and natural gas imports additionally less fuel pollution released cars would help make the enviroment safer place for current and future generations the article the author talks about the use gps and sensors used the cars relying computers transport much safer alternative compared the current option the driverless cars that are largely computer powered leave very little room for human error which would drastically reduce the number automobile accidents opponents driverless cars may argue that these cars are not safe the event unforseen circumstances such accidents road problems however driverless cars stated the article are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill thus emergency situation the driver can take over the car can advance past the situation and continue move along without any issue conclusion driverless cars could the best thing happen automobiles since automobiles were invented they could reduce the amount pollution and save the united states millions oil imports furthermore self driving cars can make the roads safer place although may seem scary some and there may few bumps along the road driverless cars could make the world better place,4

every four years there election the election used decide who our president will for the next four years the electoral college currently being used for our elections the articles does the electoral college work and defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president richard posner believes the electoral college should continue stay use the other hand the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong bradford plumer believes that the electoral college should removed from the system electing the president while the electoral college has been use for majority the time time start different process called popular vote the electoral college has been place for many years and has produced good results one good thing the electoral college does prevents candidate from becoming president they only have regional appeal this crucial because candidate with only regional appeal unlikely successful president posner with the electoral college place makes impossible for candidate with only regional appeal become president because region has enough electoral votes elect them another helpful thing the electoral college does has certainty outcome less likely for disputes than popular votes less likely for disputes because the winning candidate share the electoral college invariably exceeds his share the popular vote posner even state has few more votes for the electoral college still creates huge victory even though the electoral college has produces some good results presidents being elected through popular vote will better more efficient and more equal again the popular vote will more fair will more fair because president with more popular votes will win the electoral college candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes this happened when gore got more popular votes but lost the presidency plumer the electoral college not fair the citizens this country and the candidates more people prefer one candidate over the other then the president should clearly clearly them the electoral college also not fair because there tie then the vote goes the house representatives the house representatives selection can hardly expected reflect the will the people plumer the majority the house representatives republicans the president elected will reflected that and will not give the democrats equal representation all all popular vote should used determine the president because more fair and equal way equally important popular vote should used elect the president because then candidates and voters will pay attention the campaign with the electoral college candidates only spend time trying win the votes the swing states they will not pay attention the states that they already know have their vote fact the campaign there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited two those are rhode island and south carolina plumer every state should able see the candidates the voters get really know who they are voting for they will make better decision also with the electoral college people states that know their vote will not matter will not pay attention the campaign person such republican california have less incentive pay attention the campaign than they would have the president were picked popular vote posner everyone opinion should matter and should taken into account when electing the president summarize popular vote the only way ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need elect the president and that everyone vote matters conclusion electing the president painstaking task and should done using popular vote not the electoral college the president the united states plays important role our country the president has make many difficult decisions and those decisions should reflection the entire country should not just reflect the certain states that contributed their electoral vote,5
should change the electoral college election poplar vote its states the text the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational when you vote for president your actually voting for state elector possible that the winner the electoral vote wont win the national popular vote but that happens rarely over voters would prefer direct elections voters doesnt vote for the president the electoral college they actually vote for the slate electors wouldnt you want vote for the pesident you want except voting for the electors its unfair that some states has more representatives than others because its the representatives big states such california has representatives which represent million voters example the votes are tied and its wyoming and california decide who president obama romney and california representatives voted for romney then even wyoming representatives voted for obama romney would won they should let citizens america vote for president except for the electors personal opinion there would higher amount votes per president fair the president would elected the most popular votes the president that has thhe most votes should the one who wins all,2
cars these day have become way more gas efficent and eco friendly cars are still evolving though now cars can drive threeself you can not buy them yet though because they are not fully ready believe that driverless cars are safe the fact that the driver would probably not become focus they should and feel that they really don have anything the article states that the cars are not completely driverless because don understand how get around traffic constructions and accidents this forces the driver still alert therefore the car not really driverless and the driver feels like the car driving self and they are not being defensive could cause them get wrecks the new technology that the world coming with may not safe and thats why the world doesn know about alot the new technology that already have that why these car are still testing how can you call car driverless still needs someone steering these cars can reverse themself out driveways they have some cool ideas how keep driver alert bmw decided make one the driverless cars they say can only steer accelerate and brake themself general motors put vibrating seats the car alert the driver when they are getting close something even though they haven fully accomplished driverless car they have made big improvements since when the project first began many states have banned the driverless cars because they feel that not very safe for car driving self these states consist califonia nevada florida and the district columbia tesla has projected release for car that can autopilot the time also mercedes benz audi and nissan plan having driverless cars this new technology going cost more then the technology already have the fact that has higher value just for these cars work they needed lots sensors google modified toyota prius uses position estimated sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof and video camera located the rear view mirror and also has automotive radar sensors and gps receiver and inertial motion sensor the most important part this new technology this car the camera that consistently uses laser beams form model the car surrounding these cars have lot newer technology then you normal car you see the street the more new technology they use the more the price will conclusion these cars will more expensive then the older cars and all the cars that are out now the more technology they put the more expensive will get every state decided band them then they may never come out there alot with holding our future never know when one these driverless cars could come out and fully operational time will tell though,4
the authors suggestion about studying venus worthy despite the dangers presents exporting venus wouldn too bad regardless the dangers presents the author tells good reasons why wouldn hurt explore venus striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also becuase human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors this shows that took the time and explore venus would overcoming challenge never thought would have also helps see that humans going and exploring get our curiosity answered ike questions have about venus for example how does look how are temperatures different there than earth how different from earth and etc another reason think about venus kind our nearest option the article the author says venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit this shows that venus the planet that closer and could have higher chance visit also helps know that with being the closest planet for visit can learn about and overcome the fear and just and enjoy which you don you just having questions about venus lastly just like how and travel shoud and explore venus you wouldn really spend much like you would when you travel and buy yourself lot things the article the author tells our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the edges imagination and innovation the author telling that shoud just and travel leave our fears behind being scared and explore venus shouldn scare should just overcome the fear because don not going know exactly how venus looks just going imagine how looks also the doubts shouldn stop from going the main doubts people would have would probably like would get there safe and would get back safe those doubts shouldn stop long you know you over came your fear and went should make you proud conclusion the authors suggestion that studying venus worthy despite the dangers presents good idea due the reasons talked about that the author supported the article overcoming your fears something face life everyday why not make exploring venus one,4
many authors write about how should certain things even they don appeal seem possible authors are supposed support their claims the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers well first the author talks about venus almost like earth twin paragraph states how venus similar earth many ways one way how they have similar sizes and densities also says venus sometimes the closest planet earth second the author states the challenges and solutions them paragraph states that the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit his solution fly above the surface where its still pretty hot but nothing compared the surface also states how the atmospheric pressure times greater than earth his solution for that also flying above because high enough would similar earths third the author talks about how nasa working ways vist venus paragraph the author states that nasa testing things atmospheres similar venus far they stayed few weeks before being destroyed talks about how mechanical computers could survive modern computers are destroyed easily with the extreme conditions venus but mechanical ones that use cogs wouldn destroyed easily the author has valid claims and supports them well important that authors support their claims authors write about many different topics all the time,3
computers and technology are evolving every year matter fact more like everyday went from basic analog phones smart phones that are touch screen and even our cars are advanced now have electric cars that have wifi them they point that technology the way life will keep advancing long humans keep advancing now hav developed technology were computers can read our emotions this technology that can read emotional expressions will make learning better the process the computer reading your emotions starts making structure model your face using video imagery thennew software recognize and reacts the facial movements uses all major muscles your face reads the movement the muscles detect weather you happy sad scared angry suprised disgusted then takes those emotions and apply them the movements your facial muscles example from the text your frontalis pars laterals muscles raise your eyebrows when your suprised your orbicularis oris tightens your lips show anger facial expressions are universal they are also being used the computer can give interesting things that you would like example from the text classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games and video surgery your smiling when web appears your screen similar might follow but you show unhappy face the same will not appear next time most human communicating non verbal and that something that hard for the computer understand humans preform this calculation that the computer trying day day basis for instances says from the passage humans can tell how their friend feeling most would have trouble describing each facial expression that something that huang has made algorithm for the algorithm will constructed read the muscular movements the facial structure and create responds suited for they expression feelings this essay was inform you about the different ways computers are being advanced our technology being shaped many different ways the most modern way the reading facial expression made person from computer this technology will used world wide will help education entertainment the best test subjects show how sucessful the technology was the famous painting the mona lisa they human anatomy the painting was that she was percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry,4
shouldn able use this technology the every day human due the passage the left can calculate peoples emotions vinci used this algorithm when was painting mona lisa due huang all about the muscle expressions can normally tell when our friend stressed out upset but shouldn use this because invasion privacy someone wants someone know how they feel then they will tell somebody tell emotion you have know how the muscles move calle the zygomatic major muscles that begin cheek bone should not used the classroom because again baily invasion privacy and should not used something wrong with student then someone should let concealer know and let them talk the student not use technology,1
the facial action coding system great achievement science and technology but should used your computer school there are many reasons why using this coding system could great thing the class room disaster stated the article making mona lisa smile nick alto could put this our everyday school computers could calculate whether not student having trouble with lesson and change for them help them what are the pros what are the cons some the pros using this coding system students computers stated the article could read the students facial expressions and peterman she confused having trouble understanding the lesson could this could change the way the lesson tought better helping the student understand but what schools dont teach lessons online for example school does not teach lessons online our teachers might give website addresses look and use for studying depending the teacher unlike other schools around that learning they either stay home school and whole days work off their school issued computers this facial action coding system would work greatly for those students that learning but not much for the ones that don secondly does this system cost anything how much and schools really need spend extra money system installed our computers schools have gotten along just fine without this for years schools did just fine before they were even using technology like computers the first place don think that are really need something like this students using the internet assignments always ask questions they have any those students also have internet acess they are working online assignments they could also search for more websites help them better understand another topic listed the article was using the coding system learn that person was interested add that showed their computer not belive that adds are already annoying enough not want coding system reading face and giving adds that would more interested doing would distract that person from trying get their work done for example was student scrolling through website using fill out assignment for school don want bunch adds popping distracting from work especially when its and add that interests its something that interests then more likely click distracting from work stanly wouldn want that happen and belive nobody else does either really there are lot great points both sides the topic but mainly the schools they want use the facial action coding system not they only need ask themself the right questions our teachers teach offline alot have the money for technology like this and our students really want use this not,3
dear senator have written this letter hopes that you would change your mind about keeping the electoral college popular vote the best method voting because people voices would heard and would give more people the motivation vote begin with you probably herd the term democracy since thats what our government right well that word comes from the latin words demo katia meaning people rule popular vote would better than the electoral college because then peoples voices can truly heard scams funny buisness just old fashion voting popular vote also easier and much more simple system than the electoral college with popular vote all you look the polls and see who has more votes opposed counting each and every states electoral points until you get addition popular vote put into action then would inspire more people vote some citizens are very skeptical about the electoral collage but with popular vote the facts are the polls according the indefensible electoral college bradford plumer the electoral college winair outdated and irrational conclusion popular vote better idea than the electoral college because theres funny buisness and the peoples voices are truly heard hope this essay wrote helped you make the right decision drop the electoral college and switch popular vote you have time write back that would much appreciated sincerely proper name,3
viking snapped photo mars viking spotted shadowy likeness human face many people think was created the life mars many people think that just natural landform there was alien creation after all going tell you why this just natural landform created mars first michael malin and his moc took picture the face and claimed just natural landform the picture was more clear than the orginal photograph when nasa got good shot the face they roused out there the red planet get good shot jim garvin said photographed the face soon could get god shot and was revealed that natural landmark april cydonia became cloudless and was easy for nasa see the mysterious face nasa took picture times bigger than the pixel size there was object like airplane the surface mars you would able see what the object was turns out that the picture showed butte mesa reminds most middle butte the snake river idaho says garvin the mysterious face turned out butte not alien artifact each pixel the photo spans meters compared meters per pixel the viking photo that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars said garvin nasa apart the government the government lies all the time that kinda makes people think that nasa lying about the face being natural landmark the government and nasa are keeping secrets area they must keeping this whole face thing secret too that not butte mesa but that was created life mars conclusion nasa still hasn proved that there life space but does this face landmark poove that there just have wait and find out this story that has been going around for decades and still unsolved nasa recently found ice caps other planets and claimed that there was water mars but evaporated causing the huge valleys and canyons mars,3
facial action coding software facs impressive software has the ability scan someone face and then analyze come with calculatedpercentages said person emotion believe however computer with this capability has little value classroom first the article does specifically state your home can not handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile most schools not have anything stronger than home because they can not afford next huang predicts classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this prediction could come true assuming that all classrooms are devoid any teachers the article also states many other jobs this program could without replacing humans workplaces for instance facs could used news organizations tell politicians are lying not another example stated the article using this software select ads the web that you will like and finally paragraph says according the facial feedback theory emotion that smiling may not only express emotions but create them the author asks did making happy face this experiment also make you feel slightly happier the other hand wouldn seeing another human make the expression cause the emotion little bit more powerful rather than having robot tell you conclusion because the computers needed run the facial software are not cost effective there are other jobs can without replacing teachers and better smile because you see something that makes you smile believe computer software capable reading human emotion through facial expressions has place classroom,4
driverless cars thing myth invention the future according the article scientists have been workin the driverless car project since the the general motors created concept car that could run spacial track the track was embedded with electrical cable that sent radio signals recieve the car this was proven safe and reliable however the cost would astronomical put the abels needed all the roads the automakers used speed sensors the wheels the creation antilock brakes within years those sensors have become advanced that they could detect and respond dangerous out control skids rollovers bmw announced the development traffic jam assistant the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors made sure the driver kept their hands the wheel incae emergency automakers are continuing their work the assumption that the problems that they are currently facing will solved tesla has projected release for car capable driving autopilot perent the time mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have cars that can driven themselves saftey big concern with the driverless vehicles most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe law makers know that saftey best achieved with alert drivers currently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times because these laws most states consider illegal even test the driverless cars california nevada florida and the district columbia they allow some testing driverless cars projected over time that scientists provide more data showing that driverless cars are safe and reliable more states will revise their driving laws with current position driverless cars dont see the point what the point being able not drive your tired the car can take over for you but your asleep and the car has malfunction not only your safty but other peoples safty around you well close driverless cars have long way come before they are considered truely driverless think can expect see huge leap knowledge this subject the next five ten years scientists spend more and more time this project who knows what they will accomplish only time will tell driverless cars are truely invention the future busted myth,4
the mona lisa very impressive mix emotions painted the human artist leonardo vinci however using computer program that uses coding analyze someone feelings effective there are two sides every story sometimes one may sound good while the other bad other times may see ourselves approaching both sides and seeing the pros and cons each having computer read the emotional expressions students classroom can both effective and ineffective for several different reasons some these reasons may include emotional state lesson planning facial structure critical thinking puberty and more the emotional state most kids school can vary day day basis not every kid always happy and not every kid always sad having computer that can read and detect emotions people might not feel the need try and read each other emotion this would lessen their contact with their peers and lessen their ability comprehending and understand other people emotions and situations teachers might also worry they detect that student sad angry the other hand having machine that can detect emotions may helpful some students stated the article most all the class confused this machine would help the teacher detect the confusion and help him her explain way that the student can understand classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this quote see how this computer could help adapt better lesson plan for confused uninterested students student depressed anxious something the like the teacher can pull them off the side and send them counselor talk about and help them feel better however may wonder the student actually feeling this way technology like this used will obviously have loads coding sometimes there can flaws coding someone that can hack into and change have such sensitive thing classroom may dangerous for some students another point that not everyone has the same facial structure some people even have deformities problems that make their appearance different than other people this the case how would the program know seperate these people with the facial recognition everyone else people express themselves differently and most have different facial expressions people begin depend computer detect emotions how will they able identify different emotions themselves this leads the point critical thinking stated previously students who rely program detect their classmate feelings may not try interpret these feelings themselves these students would off into the real world without knowing how identify someone feeling angry sad annoyed more this lessons their social and critical thinking skills that are needed day day life perhaps this program could work kids certain age groups instead every classroom late middleschool and early highschool most kids are turning into teenagers this means that they start going through puberty puberty stage life where kids start growing and maturing mood swings are constant well several other feeling and emotions that are caused hormones their bodies classroom full teenagers going through hormonal changes all once the computer may detect many negative emotions mix several different emotions that are caused mood swings teachers may again become worried their students are all anxious sad annoyed bored etc there are many other reasons why this machine might useful and why may not these are some things that can positive negative about system that can detect emotions classroom there are definitely many more which could debated back and forth personal opinion not think schools need machine that detects emotions feel that creepy and instead showing emotions would try conceal them from everyone feel this way how would millions others feel the emotional state lesson planning facial structure critical thinking puberty are all things that are factors may affected this machine some are positive some are not positive all all this were ever come our schools would need long and difficult discussion put end the debate,5
think that shouldn have driverless car they can dangerous for human being and others arounds having driverless can effect human thinking dont have pay attention the road the cars know what but what the computer function stop working and the driver not paying attention and hit other car who fault would the driver the manufacture cant the driver fault why because the manufacture did many test run the driverless car why would the computer system shut down who fault that not the human its the car other reason think shouldn have driverless the money and cost they have put the make this driverless car work image all the technogym that the manufacture has have make work and the test run would have have done the total money they would have use like millions dollars that money can use something more helpful the world the car would expensive some people afford buy what they couldnt sell the car since they would expensive afford one would buy would just money going waste and the time and effort they but they would change the laws how would human react would follow start protest for why should follow the laws some human doesnt have this driverless car what the driverless car crashes basic regular car and causes bad damage the other car for the person die who would get worse the basic car the driverless car,2
you ever wonder how amazing study another planet think all the risks takes well the author the challenge exploring venus supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers having thick atmosphere shipping orbiting and testing electronics made silicon the first reason why challenging that thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide runs through venus the passenger states the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmosphere pressure times greater than what experience our own planet this piece important because gives you example how the temperature really high plus the perfect temperature for human the second reason why competitive that venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight the ground conditions the article says more importantly researchers can not take samples rocks gas anything else from distance this explains how they can able experiment things without there tools this challenging for them because they won able much example that they won able photograph and videography ineffectively the third reason why they difficult that some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested venus surface the text states modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick but tend more delicate when comes extreme physical conditions this shows how technology from now can used venus order for them use technology that they have use those old computers from back the conclusion this how the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers having thick atmosphere shipping orbiting and testing electronics made silicon being able explore other planets are challenging would you risk yourself just explore another planet,4

america have lots cars lots roads leading anywhere you want europe they have car free cities where things may run lot smoother quicker limiting car usage could raise property prices due lack highway noise and can potentially save the world from population extinction due smoke from the tail pipe houses near the highway knowledge the price usually lower because you have suffer the agonizing pain the cars honking zooming past the passage german suburb life goes without cars when had car was always tense much happier this way said heidrun walter media trainer and mother two she walked the streets where the swish bicycles and the chatter wandering children drown out occasional distant motor most american families want live quiet and peaceful homes cars were limited there would less noise and then there will higher value for the houses next the roadways smoking second hand smoking one the leading causes death all cars have tailpipe and all cars let out ridiculous amounts gaseous smoke during the average cars lifetime article read about paris titled paris bans driving due smog the goverment was over helmed the amounts smog their city they proposed law restrict drivers from driving certain days based their drivers license plate numbers thereby reducing the smog the city then when the smog was cleared removed the restriction less smoke means more fresh air more fresh air means more healthy and active people running around the world creating more jobs for better future all throughout the world goverment kings and parliaments are trying dispel smoking while cars are one them without them there will higher property values and less greenhouse gases the air believe with less cars the world will live easier life with less coughing and wheezing,3
alien life mars seems little out this world they haven made contact with now what are they doing some the alien hopefuls say that there are some major signs like the face mars well not sign any sort because some reliable research this research includes incredible images from spacecraft and that its similar natural formations earth these reasons are why the face mars just natural not alien made first all the face mars was first discovered when the viking spacecraft took pictures over the cydonia region mars the pictures looked like ancient egytian face but after studying them group the jet propulsion lab said that was only common mesa with shadows that played tricks your eyes then again and clearer photos the face were taken they showed that was only massive rock secondly been said natural landform similar those the american west the face mars just butte which occurs when lava domes into isolated mesa scientist jim garvin says reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho this face almost like natural landform right here earth acording the chief scientist for nasa mars exploration program although these points are valid how can tell what the face mars really untill actually there for all know the pictures are being obstructed martian clouds that nasa releasing false images but why would space tangency always need some more funding for even more research want hurt itself not releasing real images also why would nasa mess with the most clear powerful and detailed images the face that they have from not being right there hovering over the rock formation conclusion the face mars nothing more than natural rock formation with some cool shadows there full proof evidence that shows this true there the fact that its just like other formations the area and earth and that there are some amazing pictures taken years apart that only get more and more detailed other claims not have this kind true scientific reasearch behind them,4
driverless cars you see them movies you joke around about them and some people even see them actual thing the future cars that drive themselves all they need human alert case something happens has everything from comfortable seats and entertainment systems its uncertain entirely safe its most likely going very expensive and lastly its just lazy having driverless cars absolutely not good idea know sounds awesome car that can drive itself that seems impossible mean who wouldn want just sit car and just wait get your destination but disagree with the idea even though its genius the idea the car isn entirely safe studies show that its been driven about half million times without crash well thats most likely just few people the road but driverless cars will all over the world approved the law there absolutely way that you not going get accident what the car suddenly breaks down out nowhere technology does seem that very often and car breaking down the middle where ever you isn only dangerous for you but for everyone around you can you imagine how much money costs build those cars now imagine how much they when you buy them especially when companies like mercedes benz audi and bmw are making them normal cars alone are very expensive shouldn spending money building stuff can already ourselves drive also when breaks dwan which will eventually will extremly expensive repair might even take long period time fix and not everyone has that time not everyone has that money either laziness not saying its entirely bad thing lazy people invented most the stuff use today think about lazy people made washing machines because they were tired washing clothes and then top that they made dryer the laziest people even built cars they were tired walking they invented them for faster and easier transportation theres specific amount lazy you can get and driverless cars the absolute laziest mean just sitting the car waiting for your turn drive while the car drives you thats crazy you can drive your own self then why expect car for you was built for you driving also entertainment systems the car while you wait for your turn drive not only distracting but the driver will focused whatever they doing they not going want drive they more focused the show while driving because they think well its driverless will keep from getting accident get way too distracted then they end life death situation because they thought was the entertainment dives the car while they lives and everybody elses life are risk theres many things wrong with this idea doesn matter how many people approve its still very unsafe expensive and extremely lazy act they built cars take you places where you control the wheel where you responsible for whatever happen now who there going blame when something does wrong you the car you can expect everything done for you really hope this doesn become legal hope they change their minds and just drop the entire idea driverless cars should definately not the future should just bad decision the past,4
there are many reasons why this just regular landform like the ones have earth one reason the shadowing the landform the second that there are clouds and clouds could tamper with the camera and the third that there have been multiple pictures and only one shows face the first reason shadowing when ever you look something you could think its someone something else this can because shadowing sometimes you cant see all the features shadows make there own this the case with the face mars there might crater the mesa that could look like eyes far away and curve could make mouth shape only this one had unusal shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh revealing natural landform these both give evidence how there was change shadow the mesa the second the clouds some clouds the red planet could have gotten the way and make look more like face then mesa april cloudy time year for the red planet this gives evidence that there are more clouds then ususal the red planet the third thing the amount pictures there have been multiple pictures the mesa and only one looks like face the other pictures show mesa butte type area scientist figured was just another martin mesa common enough around cydonia this gives evidence that there are other mesas the area its just this one looks like face and technology got better would start show take away all the features the face had and those are the reasons why just mesa and not secret face mars the three things mentioned where shadowing the clouds the area and the pictures and how they got better over the years imus concluded just normal mesa,4
driverless cars are not good idea the cars are too risky for depending relying computer that could easily mess lag out causing someone something get hurt does not sound like the best idea the driverless cars are not always computer dependant sometimes when there are bad traffic conditions the cars will have the driver take control the wheel the cars are not very cheap either costing more than the average car because the driverless cars extra perks such gps rearview camera radar sensors roof sensor spinner sensor that creates model the cars surroundings order make these possibility they have convince the government change the laws about driverless vehicles most states the vehicles are illegal and can not driven roads because fatality issues they have change the laws because there accident who gets the blame for the accident the manufacturer the person behind the wheel this conflict why most states have the law protect their citizens from the hassle deciding who blame when the driverless car motion has many sensors make sure that the car can drive safely its destination the car may also not able see deer jumping out kid running across the road quickly the sensors wouldn able know when car quickly whipping around corner where the computer can not see the car would unaware any unexpected interactions and thats not safe for have our roads driverless cars are not good idea because they not controlled humans and the computers arent capable avoiding wrecks stopping for car that ran red light deer running out into the road etc should not allow these cars sold they just too dangerous can not have accidents and not know who blame,3
the idea venus studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents venus our next planet however has prove very challenge place examine more closely the author supports this idea all the information given the article everything the author saying the challenge exploring venus are not easy but they are survivable for humans venus planet pretty close earth and humans want study about know stuff about but the same time danger but people can let the danger stop them like nasa did she working other approaches studying venus knows that danger but don forget the danger can change into good thing imagine how beautiful for people living venus the idea sending humans study venus not bad idea but very challenging idea the author did pretty good job the article really enjoy,2
from reading the passage driverless cars are coming disagree from the idea creating car that will transport people without the need driver why strongly disagree with the thought this idea simply because something bad could very wrong have you asked yourself what car was built wrong that case the car wouldn work right and one would even know just because was designed from one destination the next doesn mean something could wrong then the passengers the car could get severely hurt passengers wouldn able take over the car and avoid accident when reading the passage the narrator talks about cars and how cars need the driver just case there incident the road and only the driver would know how get around that this one out many reasons why think driverless cars shouldn created,2
you ever feel happy sad angry sometimes you don even know what you are feeling well now you can there new software the facial action coding system can tell you what you are feeling even when you dont know what you are feeling fist starts off when the computer constructs computer model the face eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness yes like the that one movie all seen joy even the smallest smile you give can indelicate how you are feeling for example when you smile people think are happy when you fake smile people stilling you are happy even though you might either happy sad mad some people don even have smile and people think that they are mad even though they could happy some people just don like showing there are many reason why people may not like showing how they really feel some people don like showing because they may think they look weak fine showing your emotions maybe they can let people know how they are feeling and will get lot better let everything out some kids don like telling their parents how they feel maybe they can talk teacher who they actually trust some kids think one understand them that why some kids end killing themselves these are reason why technology should used read the emotional expressions students classroom,2
have created face the surface our planet doesn that sound stupid mean there intelligent life out there why would they waste there time puting face planet that face nothing but mountain rock formation that looks like face first off the area the probe was flying over and taking pictures was know have mesas like the article had said paragraph two scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia which where the probe was flying over most scientist believe just landform with the face looking structure next when nasa got another probe into space take better pictures just show the people like you who think was made aliens that fact just rock formation they took another picture and people still didn believe them depsite how hard position take another picture they did anyway and looked nothing like face but more like mountain lastly most the stuff made about the face mars when they released the photo like said the article stared hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for years just made people either sell more stuff there gift shop store and make movies and books because who would want watch movie about the extraodinary mountain mars they would have make false info about and say was made aliens would sell more you may say that that probe floating very far away from space how you know there not any evidence life down there well yes very far away but the picture was taken maximum resolution each pixel spans meters each pixel that photo spawned meters the planet you would able see anything that would have show alien life down there yes was nothing but mountain that looked like face next time you look something that looks like could alien outer space don believe movies novels belive the scientist they know what there doing and know what for the better human knowledge not some persoon trying make some money saying that aliens made you would buy,4
the way the author supported his claims were ways providing examples defined his examples way make worth pursuing venus despite its dangers did this comparing them the actual project the challenge exploring venus first off explains that venus our neighboring planet despite venus being close earth don know much about however later the article mentions something interesting that catches most people eye mentions long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth this caught eye especially because goes with the idea venus being interesting and worthy pursuit discover and learn from despite venus having life and probably not worth look but all that changes when states how the conditions actually are furthermore said the question despite all the dangers will worth study venus since able know what actually happened long ago paragraph three the author states thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus also states the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit these are the dangers venus when considering send some sort probe satellite investigate this planet these are the circumstances must consider the way incorporates this idea fully just shows how incredible and extreme these conditions are even try and land rover venus lastly paragraph five the author starts explaining ways study and investigate venus without having worry about its weather extremes the author explains vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way shows that has even more worth study venus are now able study venus but different angle this ties with his idea pursuing venus because have the chance find out more about even though not the best insight venus gives perfect example that every little detail learn about venus important and interesting tying all his claims together shows that venus worth the danger pursuit the planet the way compared and contrasted with each detail supports his claim strongly the author states not easy conditions but survivable for humans meaning not going easy but definitely possible,4
the author says that venus worth studying despite how dangerous can uses information already knows backup his suggestion for example venus sometimes called the evening star one the brightest points light the sky making simple for even amateur stargazer spot when the author uses information like this people are going get interested and they going want know more about venus also puts lot detail and uses other planets help explain how far away venus from the others although the author does talk about why venus interesting also talks about why and how venus can dangerous the author says numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite its proximity this shows that even the author knows its challenging study venus but still insists studying venus says that venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system why does suggest studying venus when knows how dangerous can the author talks about why astronomers are fascinated venus astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system explains the author supports his idea telling how venus could have once been for example valleys mountains and craters are things that are similar earth also thinks that venus can the nearest option for planetary visit nasa has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans study venus says the author researchers can take any samples rocks gas etc which disadvantage they have the author says that nasa working different ways they can approach venus order study some examples are simplified electronics made silicon carbide mechanical computers etc they can use modern computers because they are delicate when comes extreme physical conditions even though studying venus such challenge the author says that has value doesn think just gain more insight the planet also thinks human curiousity will lead many thrilling endeavors our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation says the author conclusion although may dangerous and difficult study venus shouldn let that stop from learning more,3
position driverless cars would that think should not have them why well because everything has and down but some are more important life than others some the technology used for driverless cars would helpful first off you are driverless car and wrecks has malfunction going save you put you the hospital and who wold fault easier control the outcome something you are control whatever may you were vehicle that you actually have drive you can catch quicker and prevent wrecks and damage either way you wither you driving the car you still have focused the road prevent accidents plus think about all the people that will put out jobs and how will not only impact but our income and environment too for example technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver manufacturer this quote does not only point out that driverless cars can more dangerous but that matter what humans are still required stay focused and take responsibility whats the point having driverless car when you have worry about staying focused and fault for wreck technology fails rather drive regular vehicle where won have worry about technology failing relaxing while the car drives and wake the hospital with fine driverless cars would better because gives you time get some coffee eat contact someone whom you need catch with but don normally have the time you won have worry about wrecks because driverless cars warn you ahead time you are prepared stressed out well than you can relax while your driverless car takes you where you need these cars can navigate drive the breaks and alert you driverless cars would taking huge risk why well because technology can crash any given time and especially during big storms what more important relaxing being safe therefore would drive regular car safe where driverless care not would rather take the risk driving myself than having worry about something not functioning right because the technology went out not processing right,3

facial action coding system facial action coding system valuable read the emotional expressions students classroom because tells you six basic emotions which are happiness suprise anger disgust fear and sadness this technology will able tell how students are doing school there daily lives can let other people aware what they need order live good life this system can reveal much about the science emotions another thing that according the facial feedback theory emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them like for example putting happy face actually works the article states that preowned drama coach constantin stanislavsky had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning way creating these emotions stage empathy may happen because unconsciously imitate another person facial expressions thats why this technology will useful cause the article they showed example when you are looking the mirror you have expression following that being said asks you suggests emotion these are the instructions for face that looks happy all about those muscular action units can even indicate the difference between genuine smile and forced one when comes experts faces don lie these muscle clues are sometimes used spot when smiling politican celebrity isn being truthful,2
the author supports the idea that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers telling several things that this our neighboring planet showing that need expand ourselves and explore and telling that venus close sister planet could come earth one reason the author tells should examine venus further telling how close this planet venus like mars our neighboring planet the text says these differences speed mean that sometimes are closer mars and other times venus since venus close the author tells that should exploring another piece text evidence because venus sometimes right around the cornering space terms the author tells again how close venus the risk here includes getting shuttle close enough that could help more importantly researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance this evidence tells that even were get close venus couldn take samples with our technology the way now would have develope better technology this evidence further shows how the author thinks that worthy pursuit venus despite the dangers another reason the author implores keep exploring venus despite the risks that need expand our horizons beyond one planet the author supports this his concluding sentence our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation this shows how the author wants push rather than simply settle where are despite the risks the author also states how exploring another planet would help further understanding earth well striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors the author saying that don explore venus now what will similar situations when the opportunity presents itself sum this paragraph the author supports the idea that should examine venus despite the risks showing earth needs expand its horizons the third reason why the author wants explore venus that has come close any planet our solar system earth the article the author calls venus our twin our sister planet what means this that venus was once very similar earth the text says long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the author tells that venus could have supported life one point another piece textual evidence furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel the value returning venus seems indisputable the author shows that venus would prime target try and explore because how close earth the author explaining that venus being close could potentially have alot crucial information about life conclude this essay the author supports the idea that should explore venus despite the risks three ways telling that venus our neighboring planet showing that need expand ourselves and explore and telling that venus close sister planet could come these reasons are how the author supported his idea,4
this paragraph the author suggest that studding venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers agree with author you know what venus venus the second planet from our sun paragraph the author said that venus hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system know that dangerous for but venus has some benet too paragraph showed that thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus paragraph author say that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today venus still has some features that are analogous those the earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit think venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents,2
the author has great passion for this topic but has not accomplished supporting the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers the author has many points how others are trying solve the problems how explore venus but does not explain why the risk worthy executing therefore scientists seeking conduct thorough mission understand venus would need get close and personal despite the risk this quote states that scientist need take risk but does not give reason why the risk neccessary this not the only way the author did not accomplish supporting the idea the author explains the history venus and its properties but that does not help support the idea long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth this quote explains how the risk exploring and studying venus was lower long ago but does not explain supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit this not the only way the author does not support the idea successfully question can the upbringing curiosity and reasoning the author seems not give response the question supporting the idea the value returning venuste seems indisputable but what are the options making such mission both safe and scientifically productive the athor questions possible options how get both saftey and productivity but does not question the risks and possible dangers exploring venus the passage continues the author only explains the options and possible ways executing the idea but does not include the risks that the options hold the passage very informative and holds great information the author supports very poorly the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers the author explains solutions that are possibility but does not include the risks the idea the author also informs the audience about the history venus but boes not help supporting the idea studying venus the author unfortunately poorly supported the idea that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers,4
limiting car usage can have many beneficial outcomes for the environment around avoiding car usage will drastically lower greenhouse gas emissions the atmosphere cut pollution big cities and make rush hour easier for human beings the first thing that decreasing car usage will that will lower our greenhouse gas emissions source german suburb life goes without cars elisabeth rosenthal rosenthal explained that because automobiles are very neccessary middle class families all around the world huge impediment current efforts drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes without cars there wouldn many greenhouse gases the atmosphere and global warming could evaded much easier according source the end car culture elisabeth rosenthal rosenthal again shows information which states that because recent studies suggest americans are using fewer cars president obama ambitious goals curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions unveiled last week will get fortuitous assist from incipient shift american behavior with less and less americans getting licenses and buying cars greenhouses gases will start plummeting faster rate than ever before also lowering the use cars will decrease pollution big cities which are usually surrounded clouds smoke from the information source paris bans driving due smog robert duffer duffer said that because the amount congestion the city paris paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city paris could have easily avoided the ban driving they stopped using cars much which would turn decrease the amount pollution the sky there was similar situation source car free day spinning into big hit bogota andrew selsky where bogota colombia the government created car free day where cars were used all and people like carlos arturo plaza businessman said that good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution another big city lowering their amount pollution well just because they are using cars less addition environment less reliant automobiles creates easier traffic and more relaxing road travel upon source media trainer and mother two called heidrun walter recalled that when had car was always tense much happier this way now more people won have the same stress they had the morning when they had worry about the amount cars the road source selsky explained that the new car free day will leaving the sredets this capital city eerily devoid traffic jams without the everyday clutter cars streets will easily more open and easier drive upon although limiting car use seems bit distant the moment and very hard accomplish all around the world with less cars there will less greenhouse gases pollution and traffic the road,4
there have been many claims out there that the face mars was created aliens this idea seem very crazy since aliens don exist think the that the face just natural landform may the day the face was discovered people said that the face resembled humans face not alien few days later nasa unveiled images for everyone see while captioning huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth the landform was just formed shadow which means this just gives others the illusion that face but just natural landform there were alien create this and only made naturally many out there have created movies books and magazine article the face but this all just bandwagon trying just sell their products and make money out false theories later april mars global surveyor flew mars take more photographs the face when thousands people were waiting for the end result confirm that the face was just natural landform since people were satisfied mars global surveyor flew back mars april with many photos take the face did indeed look like human alien face but there are sittings such things conclusion all the face really just naturally created landform with shadows that create the illusion face human alien,3
many agree that driverless cars would bring many benefits society the other hand disagree the idea producing driverless cars driverless cars will arise more problems the upcoming future driverless cars could cause more accidents something goes wrong who could you blame the manufacturer the driver and would just pointless drive places you are not directing the way driverless cars should not the next invention accidents always happen even now when humans are driving vehicles but there many accidents with humans driving imagine car driving itself car does not have reflexes therefore accident happens really quick and the sensors not alert the driver like should then there goes another collision many things could wrong with the sensors and could cause terrible accidents this case who could you blame for the accidents that occur with the driverless cars paragraph describes safety but there would new laws cover liability accident the manufactures would have some fault because they invented would their fault the sensors did not work also the person driving the vehicle fault but not the sensors did not warn them time technology making people lazier and lazier the minute driverless cars will continue make society even more lazier there absolutely fun getting car and not driving around and just waiting for something happen could your turn drive just like asks paragraph would become pointless through all that process getting your permit and license you are not driving the vehicle would hard interpret driving fun new way with driverless cars driverless cars will bring benefits way but also many complications accidents are most likely occur because humans are not driving the vehicle but the vehicle itself driving there would suprises who you can actually blame since the driver was driving but the manufacturer created there would point getting license you are not driving the car driverless cars are going pointless even own you are not driving the car yourself,3
driverless cars are coming the author made very positive points about the driverless cars but going with all the negatives although having driverless car would cool easy and fast think still highly dangor there really point having driverless cars because you the driver passenger still has stay alert when the driverless cars are either around accidents traffic jams when you are regular car you place for feet the gas and breaks the driverless cars where would you put for feet the car doing the driving for you and not mess the car flow you have sit uncomfortable stated paragraph says wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive thinking for everyone here all know driving our world today drivers are fair the road but not fair how how because drivers sometimes not pay attention the road and just when think its are turn while the driverless cars the technology fails and someone injured who fault someone was injured due the driverless car one wouldn really know who blame you could say the manufacturer but would not fair because the end the day one gets any money even though driverless cars can cool easy and fast there bad vew,2
the article making mona lisa smile disagree with incorporating the facial action coding system into classrooms mainly due paragraph this paragraph the author states tht the actors are putting someone else face the way see students know this project happening the won themselves another factor would that some individuals don produce the same aces others students often don ask questions because they don want seem they don understand forcing person get help isn terrible but also isn anyone decision except that persons most students woud probably manipulate this program seeming confused get easier lesson who that helping once students are aware that this happening they more then likely going take approach paragraph nine majority individuals don show they emotions because they don want burden others that they personal decision and completely honest that isn something you can take away there are ways around everything feeling someone else emotional state nick alto developed amazing idea that can used important situations such mental hospitals children adults and elders spend they lives locked for various reasons major population patients just can express themselves verbally don know how this causes them stuck home for years never getting better how can you get better nobody knows there nothing wong disagree with the facs program schools but would strongly insist the program was trialed mental hospitals,3
the face that located the surface mars indeed natural landform opinion believe that the face mars was naturally created not ailene life forms but through the creation the planets support located paragraph which clearly states that jpl website revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all theory may wrong because for example paragraph states that perhaps alien markings were hidden haze this theory may correct that alien life forms may have created the face mars but tests investigations are absolute nevertheless once you see the face the very first time with images and extraordinary photos you could absolutely certain that the images the face look like alien creation believe the face still creation the creation the planets anything could have occured during that process knowing the fact there not any signs investigations there its probably not what people say think that alien life exists how could have aliens created the face mars they dont exist there not any signs alien life the other hand the face might sign alien life conclusion belief that the face mars just another crazy creation that was formed long ago,2
believe that the use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom extremly valuable the facial action coding system could help detect when student bored confused can help the teacher decide how help the students the system can make things easier for the students understand the facil action coding system could help most likely help all students when students aren understanding the lesson that being taught the computer the system can recognize the students facil expressions and see that the student confused and the system can notify the teacher help the student also when students are bored falling asleep can notify the teacher get the students attention wake the student the facil action coding system can see certain things that the teacher can see teacher asks the class they understand topic and student says yes but they really don understand the teacher would most likely not see that the student doesn understand the facil action coding would see though and notify the teacher conclusion the facil action coding would very helpful the students and teachers can help students they are confused bored the system can help teachers understand what the students are struggling with can help tell students are lying about they understand the topic not the facil action coding systems can benefit everyone school,3
did you know there were different emotions detected the famous mona lisa painting you wan na know how was abe detected well prof thomas huang collaboration with prof nicu sebe invited way for computers able figure out how you are feeling based your face feel like the use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable feel like valuable because the problem school nowadays the problem with being bored when become bored could careless with whats going and become less engaged the text states classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor when the computer can catch ordem head time nothing else should issue conclusion can get around the fact becoming bored wouldn have worry about attendence school naps school test scores grades school,2
driverless cars the future the future coming our way many automotive industries have began manufacturing the driverless car believe that driverless cars will bring many positive reactions and that the idea driverless car very intelligent driverless cars will good benefits for the drivers and for the manufacturers driverless cars are begining manufactured many industries google already developed cars that could drive independently but they are not completely driverless this just the begining their creation google says that their cars have driven more than half million miles without crash which lot you think about crash million miles thats incredible google driverless car still alerts the driver during traffic issues and when pulling and out driveways but like said this just the begining their development later time they will probably will have all the minor defects fixed although the present time there traffic laws that are written saying that the only safe car has human driving all times and driverless cars are not allowed certain places when the driverless cars are proved more reliable safety there will new laws covering their liability driverless cars would benefit the driver the driverless car would only use have the fuel today taxi this great benefit the drivers perspective they would not have pay all that gas money and all know that gas not cheap waste much money just paying for gas when could using that money purchase other things the driverless cars tha have been developed can steer accelerate and brake themselves which great this would allow the driver relax during driving the current driverless cars have sensors that can detect danger meaning that when the car driving and detects something dangerous its way the car will reduce power from its engine and apply its brakes allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone meaning that the technology can work that well under pressure while humans can not conclusion fro the development driverless cars our technology advanced right now imagine the future how good will the driverless car safe and provides many benefits for the driver and the developer providing the driver with less pressure about driving and saving gas money the developer course would benefit from all the cars that would sold the driverless car the future,4
teacher imagine being able have more students engaged with class lesson that they enjoy this can very well the future some point time with new technology such the facial action coding system the facs can perceive the emotions others and send feedback which emotions they are feeling which valuable information within classroom setting paragraph states that classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this valuable information allows the teacher instructor modify the lesson that corresponds with the students emotion which return allow for more students engaged with class lesson this new technology also allows for the instructor able empathize with student that may feeling sad distraught paragraph states that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may produce them this means that the instructor can use the feedback put happy face empathize with the students more which means that you smiling anyone around you more likely smile and empathize aswell these are multiple reasons why believe that the facial action coding system classroom setting valuable not only the teacher success but the students aswell,3
pollution all know growing concern our world today there have been many efforts decrease and try ultimately end pollution from recycling not leaving your rooms light but the perhaps the best idea that car free towns and days decrease pollution many countries have already statured these ideas and the turnout had been ridiculously successful limiting car use also great way stop traffic congestion rush hours and reuse smog big cities for example paris bans driving due smog robert duffer states congestion was down percent the capital france this piece text shows how reducing car usage can slow traffic jams and make driving around faster and easier another great reason for limiting car use that percent the pollution the united states from gas emissions that why order protect our countries enviroment and even our planets the limitation car use necessary and even vital all the limitation car use great plan stop pollution and make roads easier driven and through and even safer many other countries have done and has been successful our turn try out,2
reasons why shouldn use this technology the idea which can read human emotions not easy thing the amount time technology and effort extraordinary the fact that achieved this goal technology outstanding however most this feat great could seem actually pointless with only some good things about personally believe that its not something society really needs this time sure this technology advancement can used some situations fact one the biggest things this could used for basically replace the polygraph system the polygraph test could obsolete compared this technology this technology breakthrough can used law enforcement determine whether not someone telling the truth this could make preoccupations faster and even hopefully more efficent humans instinctively hide away from their emotions they divert them thinking other things but for one hide their expression not that simple however some this technology could possibly come off breach privity matter how great this opportunity could the flaws that thing thing could have are quite emese you think about have something able read you like book almost just facial expression must difficult the algorithms are extremely complex stated paragraph one simple misread this algorithm could severly change the outcome this technology could truly revolutionary for man kind however this may only truly have one use and that replace the polygraph test otherwise there may truly use for besides for curiosity that why stand against this technology that well could possibly breach privity this technology could invade simeone personal life that truly the main reason disagree with this,3

though have not been alive see most sure that the debate keeping the electoral college changing election popular vote has been going for ages now the words fourteen year old might not mean much state senator especially since will four years until legally allowed vote but please sir hear out believe that should keep the electoral college for many reasons one the president was decided popular vote our president might not the best one for the country secondly were popular vote the president might win not win simply for being regional favorite start this off our president was decided popular vote our president might not the best thing for our country stated the third article paragraph the winner take all method awarding electoral votes induces the candidates focus their campaign efforts the toss states you know toss state make the final vote therefore people these states are more likely pay close attention the campaign and they will the ones with the most information were popular vote then anyone over the age could randomly pick winner let honest the majority eighteen year old will vote whoever their friends family vote for even the candidate representing their group democratic republic many people the president was decided popular vote would make uneducated decision one the candidates not studying their choices much one would with the electoral college system place secondly were popular vote the president might simply win because she regional favorite stated the third article paragraph because candidate with only regional appeal unlikely successful president also the paragraph states that region has enough electoral votes elect president the president was decided popular vote however can you imagine what would like take romney for example was solid regional favorite the south romney knew that there was incentive campaign heavily the south because would not gain any electoral votes increasing his purity states knew would win popularity decided the president residents the other regions might feel like their vote would not count and that the president would have regard for their interests say that popularity did actually determine winner while most regions might vote for certain presidents the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really their president however senator the electoral college was stay this problem would never exist with the system have now the people vote for your state electors when they vote for the president most states also have winner take all system therefore the canidate with the most votes state win that state electors this lets the voting even fair popular vote would make the voting unfair those who did not want that president now course the other view has adressed stated the second article because the winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning during the campaign seventeen states didn see the candidates all this quote shows that the candidates might not state they know they have chance winning can see how this could support changing election popular vote and how could reasonable our president was chosen popular vote then would visit all the states trying win them over however there are some strong arguments against this begin with one man would have visit states and even only visited the majority there still possibility that the state will not vote for him anyways the end keep the electoral college then the majority votes state would count not his popularity fourteen year old can relate this highschool student can the most popular student the school but they can also the most rude and mean and while another student may not popular they can the nicest the school the president was chosen popular vote might just end being the worst thing that could happen the country conclusion state senator think that keeping the electoral college the best thing for our country changed election popular vote the man woman might not the best for our country and the best man might not win because not regional favorite hope sir that you will take letter into account when you vote this topic,6

when comes down air pollution cars are one many the factors that lead air pollution the pollution made cars could start smog build major cities and suburban areas this can become major factor many other developed countries there one way could put end this and that limit car use there are countries all over the world that are starting new trend order limit the use cars the trend they are starting car less suburb wich bans all cars from the community this method better because they build things walking distance there need for car use this good way reducing the air pollution and also good way saving money this great move for the poeple who are jobless they wont have spend money car gas these suburbs are good place live because the air less polluted and you save money this movement also starting major cities such paris and bogota paris was one the most polluted places europe until motorist with even numbered license plates were ordered leave thier cars home and the same would apply the odd numbers the next day the days went the smog the air had reduced and also the traffic had dropped bogota motorist were also orderd leave thier cars home when the people were orderd leave the cars home they started ride bikes and carpooling get thier destination the other countries saw how this helped car pollution and traffic jams they started ban cars well this movement has vehicle makers start changing the way they make thier cars due these events this new trend has reduced the air pollution majorly and the use traffic jams have dropped they continue with this car banding the world would less polluted place and people would save money and live better,3
dear senator believe that should keep electoral colleges but massive changes the system these changes would help prevent ties avoid large number swing state and also make elections easier for one prevent ties that hard thing prevent considering have control over who someone votes for but can solved case tie due tie braker you will there will revocation process with voters these voters are picked random the city data base for example obama recieved percent the electoral vote compared only percent the popular votes cast for him number solve swing states again this something hard prevent but can solved there needs equal number over information distributed among the states and forth for the conclusion making elections easier need make the more convenient takes long time vote for you and could faster although the electoral system slightly flawed still need keep the peoples president and there are not many other ways this than due the system have now the only major problem the the system out date,2
facial action coding system valuable students you even know what facial action coding system well program system that was made from codes help computer identify human emotions well think that the facial action coding system valuable students the reason think this because your video games could have more expressive faces your home can handle the complex algorithms and can recognize when student becoming confused bored the first reason that your video game could have more expressive faces some people enjoy playing video games lot but what the point having this fun video game your going have faces that look like they are mad the game the characters game could show expression think would make lot more people into the game more people like the video games just because they got expressions then lot more people will start buying games which means that the gaming stores will get more money and then the government would get more money conclusion one the reasons why valuable kids because could make video game characters have expressions the next reason that your home can handle the complex algorithms the computer system that was designed prof thomas huang made the program for officiated computer that can handle the algorithms your home was designed not hold complex stuff was designed hold simple stuff teacher got this their classroom then could benefit the kids and they would probably have that could hold the complex algorithms unlike the ones the kids home therefore another reason that your home can handle the complex algorithms the last reason that classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored having this system classroom computer would help the kids out lot the reason say that because what there kid struggling really bad understand the problem they are working but are too shy and embarassed ask the teacher for help what are they going then just take bad grade and deal with but they have the system the computers their classroom then the computer can just read their facial expression see they are confused and then help them pulling helpful website also the kid bored and the computer reads that then they can pull helpful website for the material that they are working but also website that they can play games this shows that the coding system also can help students classroom they are bored confused conclusion the facial action coding system valuable students classroom because your video games could have more expressive faces your home can handle the complex algorithms and can recognize when student becoming confused bored this system can help these kids lot ways think this system will effective and useful for students classrooms facial action coding good thing for kids and should schools everywhere,4
dear state senator everyone has their own opinion whether not you should keep the electoral college you should change the election popular votes for the president the united states opinion that you should change the election the popular votes begin with the electoral college process the article does the electoral college work states that the founding fathers established the constitution compromise between election the president vote congress and election the president popular vote qualified citizens the electoral college process consists picking the electors the meeting the electors where they vote for the president and the vice president and then the counting the electoral votes congress next the electoral college has few things wrong with gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency george bush because bush recieved electoral votes gore electoral votes over percent voters would perfumer direct election the kind have now when voting you don even get vote for the president you vote for slate electors would nice actually able vote for who you want president the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational also you were change the popular vote would fair everyone would get put their opinion who should the president the united states think that everyone was able individually vote for their president there would less chaos and arguments about the election and also the new president but possible that the winner the electoral vote won win the national popular vote but very rare some people don bother voting because the fact that their vote will have effect they have less incentive pay attention the campaign than they would have the president were picked popular vote conclusions think that changing the popular vote instead keeping the electoral college would the best thing for the united states everyone vote will count would fair and more people would pay attention the elections and vote like bob dole said abolish the electoral college sincerely concerned student,3

studying venus worth pursuit because can help the long run something happens earth paragraph states that furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary vist also venus and earth are the same many ways for example paragraph says venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance these were some reasons why venus worth pursuit the reason that venus should studied case that earth populations grows big for earth and need more space the article says that nasa has already set ships and since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours its safe say that this mission harder than any other but its not impossible venus probably the best plant study maybe besides mars but had much uncommon with earth there chance may work paragraph says astronomers are fascinated venus becasue may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system long age venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms live just like earth venus and earth are alike lot ways those are some reasons study venus that planet and our planet are similar that maybe that could the next plant step foot may take decades but achieved that could one our best accomplishments maybe think about why important study our galaxy,3
studying the planet venus dangerous this article reading called the challenge exploring venus this article mainly mentions about the planet venus conditions and experiences this planet sometimes known the evening star this planet has alot reasons why shouldn studied the temperature conditions planet venus are extremely high also the second planet closest the planet earth and scientist wont even able observe this planet closely start off with the planet venus temperature are extremely high the text mentions the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth this piece evidence with specific details explaining how hot this planet could get this planet times greater than our actually temperature human were able this planet and actually land they wouldn even last atleast seconds that planet secondly planet venus the second more nearest the earth which means venus also most closest the sun venus goes around the earth different speeds that could probably reason why venus has extremely high temperatures the text states each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours this text talks about how they had stop giving missions venus because the nasa realized they couldn much more their partners couldn even survive instead keeping the missions for this planet they had cancel all since they were eventually getting type information but for the weather the last reason was that nasa can even get near the planet because the conditions are terrible they will have experience the planet from specific distance the text states thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans this piece evidence explaining how distance nasa will from the planet even mentions the temperature and how the conditions would hard but helps for humans survive nasa will floating around the earth trying experience any little thing they could possibly get their eyes the can even take samples rocks gas anything else conclusion believe venus couldn get studied reasons are becuase the temperature conditions pretty high the closest the sun and the earth and nasa wouldn even able experience this planet closely these reasons are why believe planet venus shouldn get studied too dangerous,4
venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents venus poses several dangerous obstacles pursuit because how dangerous the planet actually which makes the time pursuing the planet not reasonable and not worth the time for scientist the author says studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents hard already study venus because its atmosphere which made almost percent carbon dioxide makes the planet venus the hottest planet our solar system which creates big problems for spacecrafts land the surface the planet because the intense heat that venus produces paragraph the author says each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours maybe this isse explains why not single spaceship has touched down venus more that three decades the author gives good reason why trying land spacecraft not the best option observe the planet instead focus another planet that well worth the time and money spacecraft would only take moments for the spacecrafts liquefied after standing venus surface spending more time different planet that has atmosphere and geological features similar earth would ground breaking for science and especially nasa paragraph the explains thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenges are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmosphere pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth venus too hot for explore landing spacecraft would only last moments because how severe the weather venus environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquify many metals also venus geological landscape and weather like erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes paragraph the author states peering venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions because most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms photography and videography ineffective since entering venus atmosphere deadly even hovering over the planet not enough for finding more information and observations about the hot planet hovering will only give scientist limited details about the planet also having light shining out the planet makes difficult for scientist observe the planet not being able observe every characteristics venus would not make well worth the mission study more about venus pursuing venus not well worth the time and money for nasa any other scientist which does not make reasonable for scientist study and want more depth about the hot planet venus venus poses several dangerous obstacles pursuit because how dangerous the planet actually overall venus just too dangerous for people explore its not convenient for astronomers and nsa,4

when walking the halls own school see all kinds emotion high school you can probably find every single emotion just one class detecting emotions isn hard most teachers don find hard either don believe that technology read students emotions good thing nor believe would valuable source for classroom opinion would another way make society more like robots cell phones have already demonetized our emotions and ability detect how someone feeling having computer school detect how feel would not good thing understand that computers are becoming more advanced however nothing can replace the prescience real teachers paragraph talks about having computer school modify the way class taught based the emotion student this paragraph goes say the way would modify the lesson like effective human instructor this sounds like taking away teachers all together which the long run heightens the unemployment rate once again teachers aren payed for the money they teach because the interaction they have with students which comes from emotion much talk about not liking homework and tests many students have relationship with their teachers teachers can see when class bored and modify classes already whole they don need fancy equipment that they were born with part human nature lot people claim that the youth america already spends much time front computer this would taking that theory whole new level students would literally have just sit and stare computer for this technology work think the use computers further education great however detecting what emotion student expressing won help paragraph the author states that this new technology can even state when someone faking smile while this great and extraodinary what will the computer change the fake smile into real one lets honest who smiles class while learning about statistics interactive games learn don even produce real happiness the students still know they are being taught and have pay attention you see someone sad looking them and detecting won help even you give them tissue try and modify how they are feeling still doesn change their sadness not mention how many people have the exact same interests one with the technology modify the lesson for students they would almost need fill out form telling the computer what student likes and doesn like fit computer person while being able detect what emotion student feeling the computer will not able successfully modify lesson without knowing how get the students attention again only knows that the student either bored happy sad etc computer can know how focus student and get their attention based their personality unless you program which quality teachers are once again already equiped with for free paragraph states that there are only basic emotions however what about confusion the article whole never states how would help confused student paragraph briefly states that this technology will able detect confused student but how exactly will modify the lesson help the student haven yet touched base the cost this technology while paragraph doesn state how much technology like this would cost does state that your home can handle the complex algorithms this would yet another expense for schools that isn needed there are better technological things that school could spend money such security systems even more interactive classrooms get students move around and have fun school again teachers great job reaching students get them more invovled class once again they don teach for the money they want change lives through real interaction with students which them free charge maybe instead new fancy system use the money pay teachers more for what they facial action coding system will not help out classroom there are many factors that computers can detect that teacher can such their emotion from the previous day teachers know their students better then any computer will able will not increase they learning capability students could quite possibly hold them back confused student doesn know how tell computer don understand this could you please help students don need fancy system help them learn and detect what they are feeling they really already know how they feel,5
the article driverless cars are coming the author states positive and negative aspects driverless cars the development these cars would total waste for the economy there need for driverless cars when the cars drive today our own are just fine the driverless cars were manufactured and sold the roads would have change the driver would get bored not feeling control and the money build the car too expensive that lot twist and turns for the car road ahead for example the cars were develope all the roads would have change safely fit the requirements the car the text the author states that the cars require massive upgrades existing roads something that simply too expensive practical that statement just shows how order create these cars the roads would have improved for safety and that amount money horrific another reason why shouldn have driverless the driver the autonomous car becoming less needed terms driving the driver required have his her hands the steering wheel all times the car that means the car gives off the illusion the driver being control but the driver may also feel inferior the car abilities this would cause less people buying the driverless car the equipement needed make the driverless car safe and secure sensors the article the author writes how google modified toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotation sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor that lot equipement for just one car not mention the safety sensors also may unappealing the cars design and the buyers the sensors used for one car can also add onto the amount manufacture the car which causes the prices increase the prices increase less people will buy the car the text states that the cars simply announces when the driver should prepared take over which means the cars have notification system that notifies the driver when the road ahead requires human skills that system good thing have the car but what breaks the driver risk accident not alerting about upcoming driving obstacles then the law would have determine the driver car was fault less people would buy this car avoid the uncertainity being fault accident overall driverless cars should not developed because there not safety and money efficent way yet unless the time comes cars should stick being controled the driver the cars change doesn mean people are going buy the autonomous car the road ahead for this driverless car shortly coming dead end,4
steve believe that the figure see now not face created aliens merely believe landform when found the figure would agreed with you but technology was better and looks like natural landform think that was just the tectonic plates had moved and made the surface push that what believe steve april what the photo actually looked like was butte mesa landform garvin stated reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho opinion reminds hill small mountain steve even would agreed with you but look the photo just don see face steve stated before just don believe that the figure face just think that natural landform think about opinion steve,2
there are many advantages and disadvantages limiting car usage according reading passages about limiting car usage many people think that car usage doesn need limited because everyone loves their car but everyone loves their life also what mean about everyone loves their life that people fail realize that cars are troublemakers they cause alot problems and that pollution pollution from anything very harmful especially the people who don have transportation and they have walk ride bicycle their destination many states the usage cars are banned and thats because their pollution rate horrific mean who wants live somewhere where you cant even walk your dog because the pollution from the automobiles paris monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered leave their cars home suffer euro fine but the same would apply odd numbered plates the folowing day furthermore paris almost drivers were fined and twenty seven people had their car impounded for their reaction the fine paris has more smog than any other european capital did you think that paris was the only country that has banned cars well you thought wrong because bogota colombia has banned cars for three straight years and only left with buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars this capital city million bogota colombia goal promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators face fines the days without cars part improvement campaign that began help decrease the especie amount smog pollution since the help decrease the amount smog parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced broad smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and they have built new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped after all here say that many states are banning the usage cars because they send off large amounts pollution and pollution very harmful deris that can harm many people and can cause sickness and possibility death you are living moving different state that bans car usage strongly encourage you let your car sit the garage and look pretty because are trying save our people plants animals and most important our communities,2
limit car usage can bring some positive impacts our world many countries such germany france are adopting this act better their community some benefits are the reduction traffic smaller chance car crashes and injuries reduction pollution and appreciating whats around you already instead being couped car people now are replacing driving with riding bikes hiking walking where they want get just car pooling with friend germany heidrun walter media trainer and mother two says when had car was always tense much happier this way she walks the verdant streets where you can here the passing bicycles and chatter the children hanging around and roaming the streets ensure that there reduction car usage the vauban streets germany driveways and home garages are considered forbidden you wish own car you need large garage and the edge the development where you buy space for along with home paris france they enforced partial driving ban cleanse the air the city motorist with even numbered licenced plate were told laneve their cars home they have pay fine also with even numbered plates after this was done the congestion went down percent after days smog the air the reasons why france did this was because they blamed the amount gasoline coming from the cars the smog got out control they decided limit car usage america the reduction car usage also going down people are depending more biking walking their designation catching ride with friend new york has new bike sharing program along with bridge and tunnel tolls which reelect those new priorities source the author and another citizen have similar traits with their children and cars spivak son owns car but prefers take the bay area rapid transit the authors chidren didnt bother getting drivers license even though they live places where they should have one they dont think having car necessity they rather stick with their jobs take public transportations and just walk car pool where ever they please have their social life limiting car usage has many more beneficial ways communities and being adopted numerous places,3
driverless cars should not aloud the roads are already unsafe could harm other people and would very costly afford driverless car invented driverless cars would become problem the late general motors created concept car that could run special test track the track was embedded with electrical cable that sent radio signals receiver the front end the car the roads are already unsafe people are already reckless drivers and don follow the rules pay attention the roads were get driverless cars you think people would more careful cars have sensors cameras gps etc already built into cars why need cars that can drive themselves unnecessary for drive driverless cars the paragraph says the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when situation requires the car driverless why would have take over should safe possible driverless cars could harm other people the roads car mindcontrol human will not able stop with all the technology getting put into cars could big trouble the future you want car that driverless more accidents could happen driver the front seat and the car driving its self and the person not paying attention the road and something going with the car you think that would safe driverless cars could very costly people with everything they are trying put into cars the cars could very high price why make them only couple hundred people can aford them why waste all the time build one think driverless cars should not aloud think someone you know one its very unsafe conclusion cars should not driverless the roads are already unsafe could harm other people the road and could very costly driverless cars should not aloud,3
technology continues advance becomes more complicated complex and innovative today society just eleven years ago the iphone did not exist and yet now have access printers life saving medical advancements and the facial action coding system that right this new technology sometimes refered simply facs and developed professor thomas huang the beckman institute for advanced science the university illinois has the incredible ability read each and every emotion displayed person face for instance the invention identified vinci mona lisa being percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry while this demonstration its ability certainly impressive should instead think about the potential that this machine has useful tool elsewhere such the classroom the facial action coding system could utilized brilliantly read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable idea that could change the way school run first all teachers could use this tool test how their students react certain lessons topics and concepts using the facs gauge the class they could identify how modify lesson plans for future units and for the years come huang states classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored the teacher could access and interpret these results the computer itself could modify the lesson like effective human instructor the emotional information these students could provide valuable information and instruction that would turn give student more confidence and better understanding the topic hand secondly the facial action coding system could used help pupils measure the effectiveness not only lessons but homework assignments well from student perspective homework the dreaded and unforgiving punishment that one always has look forward when one gets home the facs was used measure the reactions kids certain assignments the new technology could modify these assignments better fit the needs each individual student the same topics would still taught but not every individual learns the same way using this emotions reading innovation each student could learn and develop better connections with their current subject material lastly there are some who might say that the facs would useless helping the learning process child naysayers could claim that this type instruction would never work classroom because computer can provide the same type personal connection that teacher can develop with student however this exactly what the purpose the facial action coding system should personally instruct student based that child specific learning needs the computer technology itself may not able directly teach new topic but can certainly help the process identifying what methods work and which ones not classroom conclusion the use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom incredibly valuable tool this innovation can pave the way for the future instruction setting template for teaching for years come not only could the facs used help teachers modify the way that they present their information classroom the facial action coding system could used additional item help students with their homework while some might say too impersonal effective this new technology could truly the most personal and individual type instruction that the world has its fingertips the end huang said best most human connection nonverbal including emotional communication computers need understand that too,6
one could say that the face mars was created aliens say just natural landform reasons for this statment three simple things the pictures taken mgs the similarity with mountain range the and shadows in mgs mars global surveyor drew close enought for second look the called face said unmasking the face mars picture was taken the face nasa and yes did look like face but then again the same picture was taken mgs now the camaras had gotten alot better and more sharpe then mgs took picture the face and this time they new was longer face was natural landform also camaras had meters per pixel but was meters per pixel that amazing change you look the picture from the landform does look like face but the picture you can tell the similarity that landform the one running right throw the west the usa you can mesial see the pikes and valleys and you can also she how the elevation changes not spying aliens are not real but they did not create this landform last reason for why this landform natural and not created aliens because the picture from you can see shadows these shadows are from the pikes the landform just like normal mountain when looking from the top the valleys you can see shadows the shadows are what give off the face image hope now you can understand why the face mars not actually face just natural landform know this becasue pictures taken similarity real mountains and the shadows the landform,3
have you ever wanted get hit car that had driver that wasn driving can explain where that idea had came from there new car coming out that can wassit you driving but would you really want take that chance here are simply few ways why would pose this idea the chance getting detracted while having something wassit you the car the other reason why would oppose this idea again because the liability the accident and the last reason would just too many distractions all around and risk everything around when you can just drive normally also known being lazy first the thing with this driverless thing crazy they are many things that can get your ways and mess you all takes couple seconds end wreck and all that can avoid just simply driver yourself around second with all that drama with the driverless thing there would lot complaining about and say someone got injury one these driverless cars that google has came out with whose fault would the driver the manufacture that made the car who will ever known because people would lie save themselves and also get lawsuit the people who made the car and tha would save lot time and money they would have just stuck the regular car last but not least the people who make the car will have ton lawsuits their desks save all this time they should just keep the cars the same and work preventing those cars even safer before they decide doing something else this what would call pure laziness opinon should not what take the chance injuring someone conclusion they are unlimited reasons why should not have these driverless cars suport this answer and will save money and have safer enviroment and really just rethink about the whole idea but going with instincts help the people who not know about,3
the challenge exploring venus the author does good job prove that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers that are presented they this giving information based actual conditions studies and actual experiences the author used combination all three these prove their claim that venus worth the danger the conditions venus are great mix specific material the author thoroughly explains each part the atmosphere venus the text says that these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth such enviroment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquify metals they are proving that the conditions venus would exceed anything that our bodies could handle despite saying this they make point when they begin into the discussion the education could bring the text shown that astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system the author supports his argument very well when they say this they used status stand point which gives the author more credibility then forms question within the text doing this brought them the opportunity show the research they had conducted for this writing piece the author brought the research the true experiments that were thought through nasa builds nasa ideas explaining the deepest points but never hits oppostion until the next paragraph when they this creates amazing idea that could have the possibility work imaged into the readers heads they eventually hit the opposition and shows the down fall with nasa great plan they state the text that more importantly researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance therefore scientists seeking conduct thorough mission understand venus would need get close and personel despite the risks when the author decides say this they prove the irony all you can close and personal with the planet then you can learn the reasons you truly can not from the opposing standpoint was supported very well once they did that they then back track support their claim they this explaining the experiments done the past they state comparison the readers when they say just imagine exposing cell phone tablet acid heat capable melting tin this comment that was made impacts the writing positively when they this gives the readers something think about imagine brings the issue them and gives them chance relate somehow the conclusion that provides gives clear closing states his claim again and uses his evidence bring the topic point the closing gives you something think about leaves you wondering about the topic and forming your own opinions the conclusion states our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet very edges imagination and innovation the right thing not starve from the education that could provided just because dangerous boundary all the evidence that they have stated and proven through the whole essay just ends with them eventually just stating that the right thing the author does good job proving this through the whole essay,5

dear state senator think that the electoral collage should changed because makes voting unfair more people would vote and would more effective the electoral voting system unfair because your vote doesnt really count the majority the votes goes the opposing party would more even your vote counted directly towards the party rather than voting for your states electors also feel that more people would vote because with the state electors your vote wont matter the majority piste who you voted for also other people would vote for other parties more rather than just the democratic republican parties because the majority the people are just gon na vote for those parties the votes were not for the state electors and for the president than george bush would not have been elected and the majority the votes went towards john kerry that wasnt fair for him also every states number electors different they are going have electors per state think should the same amount for every state because more the states voted for the republicans but the democrats could have had the states with the larger amount electors and won the election the tinier states wouldnt much for the election they only have three electors also without electors voting there would less chance there being tie the election might make counting the votes easier but voting would more effective was without state electors those are the reasons why think that the way voting should changed and hopefully someday will,3

there are good benefits and bad benefits not having car with your legs being your transportation get around the city allows you get new experience getting around but can also pretty nerve wrecking knowing you have walk everywhere you want but the more walking you the less money your spending having worries about paying for gas car notes tickets etc another good thing about not having car staying shape walking around get where you need would get you more than plenty excercise nothing like having nice healthy body burning calories and even pounds having nice strong and healthy heart and burning off the fat that you put doing nothing and being physically active walking less accidents car jams traffic problems and even car pollution what parent doesn want cleaner air for there children breathe less cars can somehow lead safer environment less car accidents dealing with people texting and driving which could lead less possiblities death maybe one wants walk everywhere their trying nothing wrong with going for nice bike ride there limiting car usage can maybe differ the world cause less problems less worries and the best all save more money,3
dangers job but them know how work with and work their way around they don get hurt all and the text says that modern computer are enormously powerful and quick but tend more delicate when comes extreme physical conditions that was found panagarh the venus has the hottest surface temperature more then other planet the solar says the text that venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer our sun beside all them things the wether bad because they have big and powerful earthquakes and scary lightning and says that the text beyond high pressure and heat venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes amd frequent lightning stikes probes land onis surface,1
position driverless cars believe they are very dangerous and should not used anybody although they may nice when you don want drive somewhere but need not believe this something americans should taking for various reasons first off not think self driving cars are very safe were self driving car would not able relax and trust the car the driving because fear hitting something causing accident just stopping the middle the road even the car had automatic stop and auto break systems would still have very cautious and keep eyes the road which similar driving car why not save the anxiousness and drive believe americans are getting more and more lazy therefore they want self driving car instead just driving themselves think that driving yourself and making sure you are safe much better idea than putting you trust computerized car many questions come mind when think about self driving cars question that comes mind while thinking driverless cars whose fault accident caused would you blame yourself for the accident the cars since was driving many problems would arise when dealing with this for example the car industry blames the accident the person the person could sue the car company stating that was the car control therefore not being the persons fault would the cars the other hand car industries could argue that the person should been paying attention the road and not putting their full trust with the car conclusion there lot think about when dealing with driverless cars whose fault accidents would what the new age limit for driving would and also whether not put you trust into these cars many problems and conflicts would occur therefore believe the people should stick driving the cars how hard drive car ourselves really need the help are just too lazy want drive places although admit would nice not have drive when going long distance trips dont think able trust the car drive for and wouldn able relax when dealing with self driving car even had been tested multiple times don think ever switching self driving car,4
think that would useful the computer could know and understand the emotion expressions the students but don think that could actually happen the reason why because you could text someone and you could playing around but they could take you are mad angry them for example you and could texting back and forth and could tell you something and you could say what ever and could seriously take that into consideration that you are now mad personally not think that could ever happen but were ever happen then yes think that could help the students personally think that could possibly even help the students better school the computer were able tell emotions and the expressions the emotions then also fell that when student writing essay and the teacher reading then they could tell how the student feeling expecially something that serious and about the students childhood and their story really depressing then the teacher could understand the student more that the resona why think that would useful the computer could know and understand the emotion expressions the students but don think that could actually happen the reason why because you could text someone and you could playing around but they could take you are mad angry them,2
venus often referred the twin earth the second closest planet the sun space crafts have been sent venus despite its extreme conditions there has not been any humans sent venus the last spacecraft was sent was three decades ago spacecrafts have not lasted more than few hours after landing venus the author this article suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents astronomers and scientists are fascinated venus because the most similar planet earth the article states that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today venus has some features that are the same those earth venus has valleys mountains and craters mars and venus are the closest planets earth and often times mars closer than venus due the speed changes which two planets closest nasa working technology that would allow further studying venus one their solutions the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray this means that they would have something that could fly over the many storms avoid the bad conditons this idea more thought out than the spacecrafts that would have land and would only last few hours another one nasals projects simplified electronics made silicon carbide that have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions the author does have some convincing details the article though the conditions venus seem harsh and there has not been anymore attempts send more projects down venus three decades does seem like nasa working hard get things fixed and ready for possiblity sending projects down the details presented were convincing and makes good article the author persuading but the conditions that venus holds are not convincing,3
you car may mean more than just getting from point point cars play much bigger impact than may seem they affect not only the person driving but the people around they also have negative impact the greenhouse gases riding bicycle work one day won just good for you will also good for the enviroment around you cars have become universal item lot people have them but really gives them much thought there are few places that have spent the time and really developed ways keep community clean without the hazardous fumes coming from the car exhaust for example vauban germany has developed system where cars are banned the only place you can keep your car the outskirts town designated garages due this most people dont even have car and have chosen sell before moving bogota columbia they had developed day free cars where anyone that drove car would have pay fine according the governer was amazing thing and everyone was participating this also helped get some the nasty gases that they produce away cars give hazardous gases threw their exhaust these gases will rise and get caught the ozone which impacts the enviroment greatly more ways than one can cause the air your breathing toxic also one the main reasons for global warming paris learned this the hard when they reached record level pollution they decided they had choice but ban half the cars one day and ban the other half the next day after this the congestion was down proving that has helped greatly just imagine one day instead driving you could ride bike and help change the enviroment places have tried develop ways reduce the levels gases some have been very succesful for example bogota and vauban they have found creative ways help the question whether not cars should done with all together that have say cars play big part getting work time traveling taking cars away would mean taking away family trips and other fun things with cars the real answer the question that cars should not become much necessity there should ways for people get around better without the use cars now what that might the future has yet tell,4
disagree that this facial action coding system beneficial for the classroom there are many things about this that could wrong this type technolgy would not valuable our schools although all the facial recognition sounds good there are some parts that could bad there are many things that could turn out negative here question think about downgrading teachers the sixth paragraph huang the beckman institute for advanced science predicts classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored continues with then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor believe trying say that teachers don enough have bring computer instructor make less boring this not only bad for the students but also the teachers this also can distraction class while the teacher giving lecture about important skill that students need learn there are students the back the classroom trying mess around with the facial coding system trying different faces and causing disruption kids are easily distracted and this just another distraction from keeping kids engaged and focused the studies that they will need for the rest their life while child learning for instance math program site they could trying get but there are ads that pop paragraph states that you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different child looks away from the computer his her friend wait for over that she doesn want and smiles while glancing down the screen see the over the computer could take this happy signal for the then will play another one that similar the that the child did not want not believe that this technology would very good tool express the classroom believe that there are lots things that could wrong and not enough right don think that this coding system would valuable our schools,4
believe driverless cars are good start for more modern future although don believe they are such great idea for could great have car that drives you around but will you really enjoy the fact not being able drive anymore teenager dream the day they get their permit just they are aloud begin learn how drive that way they don have depend others for rides school work other activities know this because teenager myself and dream the day that will able get drivers license and able drive friends the movies the mall what about drivers license will those not required driverless car will you need special permit able own driverless car the case accident and someone injured who will fault the driver the manufacturer believe this will cause alot conflict between the manufacturer and the individual because accident occurs how will anyone know what cause the accident this could become million dollar problem plus you can never really trust piece machinery because sometimes something just goes wrong and taking the fault for something that you did could become very annoying and frustrating its like getting trouble for something that your sibling did and your sibling just standing laughing you because you got trouble and they didn believe that having driverless cars become new thing our world bad idea not only are the expensive but the roads will have smart updating all the road the world that also very expensive although expected have completely driverless car alot traffic laws will have change but what about the people who don have driverless car will the same rules applied them personally don see myself driverless car unless best friend rich millionaire may instead driverless cars can have self conducted trains subways buses other forms transportation why don make our bikes and motorcycles driverless too what fun will have when everything done for first all these things could fun have but later could feel completely useless,4
imagining day without car seems impossible you are one those people who depend car seven days week you fellow citizens take the chance live least day without car you would experience all the advantages not having vehicle these advantages include saving money time and the enviroment not only will you saving things all wish save will also gain the opportunity have more one one time with friends even family experiencing day without something you always depend may seem foolish considering passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states paragraph source german suburb life goes without cars living day without your vehicle you can find yourself saving time according paragraph source the end car culture transportation traffic are woven into connected network save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety more and more people decide live motor vehicle free life then this could result less traffic which can result having enough time for that cup coffee before work although you dont have car get further places that means you would have take public transportation such bus when riding bus obvious that you are not the only passenger which means that you are not the only stop this could result longer ride when heading some where its common that the person needs wants get there specific time this could reason why not having car could not apply you apparently using public transportation car pooling can give you the opportunity bond with your friends who would want that before arriving your eight hour shift mentioned paragraph the rise cellphones and car pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements source the end car culture this could difficult for you imagine but known that humans are creatures habit people who stopped car commuting result the recession may find less reason resume the habit paragraph source the end car culture this means that once start this amazing and life changing habit won able stop clearly not having vehicle could give you many advantages your every day life more time being wasted losing touch with close friends instead viewing this something negative take something positive that you could adapt and let riding bike work life changing habit,3
today there are many reasons why should and should not have car one the main reasons air pollution many people are baying cars and all these cars are creating all this pollution the united states enviromental protection agency promoting cars reduced after near record pollution paris banked driving clear some the air believe cars cause huge disadvantage our clean air but not agree with banning people from driving gassed cars but would better for the environment people would start buying electric cars hybrid because some dont run off gas and some use very little gas using these electric cars will benefit everyone because cost less instead buying gas and leaves cleaner air our environment even lets say forty percent united states citizens used electric cars that would still leave huge roll having cleaner air for breath but all switch electric cars then cities need provide chargers for cars like this that are out for while and our cars battery dies can charge the car think people dont use these cars much because they think well what happens cars battery dies then there screwed believe they came out with chargers and bigger cars for families then more people would want participate joining electric car because this wont just saving them money this also saving some the air that breath,2
not think that having facial arion coding system classroom would helpful simply believe student wants learn properly then they will change their attitude instead keeping plain mad sad someone wants something they will and their emotion will change they have fun what they are doing then their mood will change into more positive one all depends what they want are doing could helpful seeing students are happy not but maybe somebody not showing their emotions then they just want keep themselves sometimes students just not feel well and they act happy one will ask them what wrong maybe they just are plain and smile just get others into good mood some students will also keep things their mind that they not want others know they not bother them they should talk about things that get them into such mood with others and sometimes they are not given that opportunity take the chance and talk with someone for help sometimes they just have sit there the emotions students should not detected robotic mechanism and told that their mood like how mona lisa percent happy disgusted fearful and percentile angry students should able tell their own emotions and not need have facs tell them how they feel the machine could get wrong and they could completely have change emotions they also could feel less comfortable knowing that someone something else knows how they feel again they might not want anybody anything know how they feel always okay express emotion and hide them feel that having facs classroom would also breach privacy because people may not want share how they feel this why having facial action coding system classroom would not helpful because may make the situation that they are worse they may trying ignore their situation that they are because they may trying forget this temporary problem,3
have you ever wanted drive car but never anything well now days they have cars like that and here tell you that great idea buy use one one good reason for old people who may have bad vision are sick another good reason because some people may injured where they cant drive another good reason because you really dont have learn drive but you will still need learn the rules the rode for all you people ages and who may have bad vison sick maye just old drive you wont have worry you have car that drives itself you want see your grandkids instead them always coming over your house you can over there without making hard your back eyes what you want the store get some food what about when you want just hang out with your friends family spend time together just because would most defiantly take this car into consideration for people who are injured you wont have use that injured arm leg you just sit back and relax the car takes you wherever you want you need you wont have worry about over working your injury while getting there you just think about what you are gong when you need work you wont have worry about making yourself more sore after you this would great rent car for when you banged last reason because you wont have learn drive because all you are doing basically taking cab you wont have worry about how fast your going you wont have worry about getting pulled over you dont have worry about you are going the right way because all you have put where you want and will takes you there yeah you might want know the rules the rode just because you might have something wrong with the car but the point all you have just sit back and relax have you ever wanted drive car but not anything well just gave you great reasons why you should have you take thoughts into consideration and hope you out and buy you one the best cars invented,4
for againt with this technology because you can just show others what they feel because some people may not like show their feelings with others sometimes technology makes mistakes too technology not always right can technology actually calculate emotions like math homework don think because not because they are showing sad emotion doesn mean that they are sad the new technology might sometimes wrong does expression the mirror suggest emotion course you can tell what emotion what others showing the mirror can computer tell what emotion does person showing just looking course not can technology indicate the difference between genuine smile and forced one don think computer can detect fake smile because didn say that the new technology can tell person showing fake smile real smile whoever thought that making making faces could reveal much about the science emotion expert faces don lie these muscular clues are sometimes used spot when smiling politician celebrity isn being truthful other people can tell other people faces they are not being truthful know that technology can solve anything but made them program them thats why technology can detect our emotions that means that technology not the one who telling our emotion its humans using this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom not right because this emotion private for other people technology should stay away from other peoples business not right for the technologies just and detect other students emotion students have the right privacy for their own self should not use this technology for some people they are ashamed their share their emotion with other people technology should give privacy for the students even though scientist proved that they could detect someone emotion know that technology important but have use right use not using technology just detect the students emotions can tell that mona lisa smile fake because she didn show her teeth and she don have big smile,3
there use for the technology being able read human emotions emotions are fundamental and visceral characteristic people communicate why not have artificial intelligence aid helping that especially class according the paper making mona lisa smile speaks classifying emotions using the mona lisa and its stats was impressive but does humanity need answers point yes could improve the people satisfaction the technology like the examples modify the lesson and make computer animated faces more expressive can help students alter the work understandable and inviting alters itself for lessons this can help the student retain the information and invigorated learn boredom leaves the students face there are also many other possibilities online communication becomes more vital that others can tell how the others feel aid situations where important class discussion and whatnot can also help with therapy keep track the patient this technology can provide with many benefits but can countered for being slightly invasive too although sometimes tools have both sides the table needed classrooms somewhat taxing for computers now read emotions emotions are valuable and important know for technology able utilize that would tremendous help the classroom,3

like the idea driverless cars but dont think its something should bring into the world isnt one thundered percent safe and feel would expensive first off safety safety probably one main concerns all know that electronic devises bug out all the time lets say you have very important meeting and your alarm your phone doesnt off what does that cost you maybe your job punishment for missing that meeting now imagin that instead you phone its your car now instead your job your life secondly money are economy isnt the best where would get all this money for something that isnt completely necesssary the writer states that not only would take money for the sensors and the cars but also road these smart road would need installed before any cars are even released that takes time and money dont have this really good idea the passage says television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves was aware that you arnt support things you see this really what america developing its free time could improving society cancer something have been working for years and now there going put time and money into something that dont need what the price range these new cars will these new smartcards the same regular car when they format the road will regular cars not use the roads will the poor and middle class able even drive they cant afforded new smartcard these are questions that need answers this idea will ever come into affect this take these smartcards sounds like good idea but raises many questions and doesnt answer enough all these reasons are why think smartcards should stay the movies,3
throughout history mankind has depended hands work for critical purposes however technology has evolved tool assist labor more efficiently and quickly important decision whether not support driverless cars because can affect the conflicts due this choice human error has been common factor for automobile accidents across the nation which has claimed many lives driverless cars can another tool for the human population that could save lives begin with manufacturers have tinkered this project for many years several strategies such general motors and their concept car that ran unique test track began the using binary code alert the car system unfortunately upgrades that period time were too expensive used widespread this began the alternative option smarter cars rather than intelligent roads assist drivers likewise the government obstinate testing for every single liability smarter cars can held for above all priorities for the smarter cars ensure complete saftey from dangerous hazard conditions the road prevent such conditions developers considered the use driverless cars assist drivers instead total control all times furthermore scientists and engineers have added ideas from each other enabling cars even sensor dangerous obstacles for example the bmw traffic jam assistant one the many cars that can preform driverless certain extent allowing for human driver access the controls necessary this evidence concludes that driverless cars are potential wonderful tool help the saftey others vehicle driverless cars could the next common technology among the human population like computers phones from this humanity will continue evolving and strive through conflicts similar this subject however another choice for individually whether not accept change,2

the article the making mona lisa smile the author states how scientist can tell you happy sad mad think should use this device classrooms and all around the world used this classrooms would make teaching way easier wouldn neat didn have tell people how feel just think about but then again may turn out bad cause could lose many jobs cause have robot see are sad not wouldn need tell people how feel like councilors doctors now did use facs would help people way more honest but then again may not what reads your emotions wrong and get sad mixed with mad that could really bad could also save expenses with the computer you dont need breaks will always there read your emotions one way computers could mess what diagnoses the wrong medicine someone for being sad then could possible kill that person maybe will make but then again could prescribe the best medicine you conclusion would best used computers classrooms,2
know that driving from one another easier but their alot disadvantages that there are many good things that come out limiting car usage the text german suburb life goes without cars they mention that have with alot the pollution the air from driving limit ourselves with driving then can help the atmosphere become less polluted also states that when you have car you become more tense because the other drivers driving around you when you limit yourself car and walking around mentions you become alot happier driving from place place you tend get caught traffic jams and can become very stressful but the article car free day spinning into big hit bogota they say you walk bike skate anything that doesnt involve car you can avoid all the traffic with less cars the streets there are less car accidents with other cars people having this kind adjustment you could save life with this doing there are different ways getting work school without everyone having use car the end the car culture states that you could take public transportation car pool with friends and family the end there are many positive outcomes not always having rely car many people could even get healthy from walking work school besides sitting car and not doing anything yes nice having car take you everywhere but its not benefiting the atmosphere your body many people forget how nice walk around and enjoy the outside without any traffic road rage the streets its your decision the end wether want limit yourself driving but now you could understand the other ways without having stress and worry about the other drivers hitting you you getting accident life becomes easier,3

position driverless cars that personalty dont like the idea because what happens one the driverless cars mess glitch while busy highway just regular road and someone gets hurt whos blame the comapny that made the car would feel more safe was control the car not only because could control messed butt someone else messed also could steer out the way also what you wanted offroad with and you cant becasue the car not programed for off road would take the fun out driving think another reason dont like that far the driverless cars that the speed isnt very high now and your wanting get somewhere fast possible the fastest your driverless car can mph and that wont get you anywhere fast another reason what happens when new roads are made not everyone going want update thier car just new roads can programed into knows where turn and how fast should the new roads also what person walking and deshields jump out front you and run the other side the road there are animals the side the road and the car dosen see dosen know slow down and make sure nothing getting ready jump and run across the road the only way would think driverless car would good idea would also let you take control any moment you wanted not just when the car needed help incae construction work also the people making these driverless cars took full responsability for wrecks caused their cars and they could possibly make them faster and made them very very safe,2
going write about why the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangerous present form the passage called the challenge exploring venus the author suggest that because the passage there are very different and interesting things about the challenge exploring venus first because paragraph say that venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and say that occassionally the closest distance too second because the person that suggesting read the passage the author and suggesting that because the passage very interesting like these differences speed mean that sometimes are closer mars and other times venus and that will very interesting people read and know more about venus and explore remand passages articles everything that has with venus also say that our solar system venus the second planet from our sun while venus simple see from the distant but safe vantage point earth has proved very challenging place examine more closely also nasa working other approaches studying venus for example come implied electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulation the chaos venus surface show that the the passage must reader many people beacuse the author give the best from him and because very interesting passage the readers can learn alot from venus second because page say that venus has the hottest temperature any planet our solar system even through mercury closer sun the people would very interesting know that how can that possible that venus has the hottest temperature even that mercury the more closer the sun also because say that venusian geology and weather represent additional impediments like eruption volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land its surface the author saying that the readers can notice that venus have very different and powerful things also page say that astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth people would shock reding this and the author will see that was correct suggesting studying venus finally because the all passage has demonstrate that very interesting read page say that striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors this part also say that travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation conclusion think that many people should read the passage because has very interesting things and because they can learn more about venus students can learn more about venus and other planet from this paysage and learn how they work and this can help them school class some classes like biology maybe history think they have read and studying like the author say that what will suggest too write paysage like this other other person write passage like this very interesting and very professional,3
although quite controversial the pros driverless cars far outweigh the cons this modern marvel takes transportation the next level and can potentially save millions lives and dollars many states still hold laws that prevent limit the use these autonomous vehicles but this rapid rate improvement won long before driverless cars roam the streets the development this newest form techonology driverless cars will help improve the world due their reliability cost efficiency and safety currently there are many people out there who find autonomous vehicles untrustworthy and usafe but with recent updates techonology there shouldn any worries techonology such sensors have been around for decades stated paragraph the automakers used speed sensors the wheels the creation antilock brakes this shows how long sensors have been around and that they are nothing new with new inventions such these consumers are able depend driverless cars when responding dangerous situations such rollovers out control crashes also there are many other safe benefits autonomous vehicles for example driver were under the influence alcohol rather than forcing them home risk the car would able safely return the consumer home this could potentially lead far less crashes and many lives saved not only are driverless cars reliable but they are extremely cost efficient the long run now millions dollars are being spent order perfect the techonology being used these futuristic vehicles but you were gather estimate the money being saved fixing cars that got crashes the amount spend research would miniscule paragraph the author states radar was device hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars wasn something you could buy radio shack the development these cars may much first but over the course few years will greatly decline such that the radio making accessible many consumers throughout the country this cost efficiency vital step the improvement human life and safety finally there the overall safety the car autonomous vehicles are much more trustworthy than the average human being with the development cellular devices drivers pay far less attention the the road than they should the sensors and computer software developed into these vehicles can lead cars with better handling and prevent hundreds crashes not only the techonology used today safe but there are many other inventions being manufactured that can help benefit those the road paragraph the author discusses how has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object technology such this can only improve and eventually lead well developed driverless car which consumers can depend for their safety conclusion the development driverless cars extremely beneficial multiple circumstances involving the cost effectiveness safety and reliability autonomous vehicles are the next big thing and will lead greater world this technology will lead great things and improve economies saving millions dollars there still much improve the road autonomous vehicles but before long won have worry about the dangers driving,4

fellow citizens have many advantages they start limiting car usage there are many other things person can avoid driving their motor vehicle car pooling public transportation riding bicycle and walking are few ways you can get your destination car usage big problem because all the disadvantages has the good thing that limiting car sgae emissions will lower the people can conserve resources and improve safety lowering emissions has with greenhouse gas greenhouse gas any gaseous thing the atmosphere that capable absorbing radiation traps and holds heat the atmosphere lower greenhouse gas then will prevent the earth from global warming source one the writer says automobiles are the linchpin suburbs and that experts say huge impediment current efforts dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipes this line states that automobiles becoming hug problem because uses gas and causes greenhouse gas emissions conserving resources important advantage limiting car usage resouces are what people plants and animals need conserve resources air pollution can not problem but because the diesels from cars after days near record pollution paris enforced driving ban clear the are the global city states the narrator source this states that driving vehicle that contains diesel engines has caused pollution and has been banned clear the air the city air pollution when harmful solid particles and gases mixed the air pedestrian bicycle private cars commercial and public transportation are was reduce air pollution explains source improving saftey what earth needs safety important and car usage does not limit people saftey will increase and not good way can not continue living with the earth having problems because will effect our safety air pollution will cause inhale dangerous particles and that will cause the people have bad health conclusion there are many advantages limiting car usage there are many different ways from preventing bad things happening car usage increases then there will many problems earth can slowly make change avoiding car usage hard but must happen,3
venus the second planet from the sun the closest planet earth density and size venus the brightest points light the night sky for many can see since venus sometimes near earth people have sent many spacecraft land each times they sent spacecraft was not successful because the surface over degrees fahrenheit clouds highly corrosive sulfonic acid and atmospheric pressure times greater even though venus inhospitable astronomers are fascinated because once believe been earth like long ago the text said the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans study venus they make the spacecraft hovering over venus avoid the bad ground condition will thirty plus miles above the surface but will still will very hot around degrees fahrenheit but pressure close sea level earth people are striving meet the challenge show venus has value not because gain insight the planet,2
there have been many studies done find new home for humanity one the planets that scientist have been looking new home venus althought there are many dangers such the temperature atmosphere and natural disasters venus has many good qualities and very similar earth venus similar earth its air pressure being similar the earth sea level pressure being close the sun having planty solar power and once believed have oceans and support life venus often called the earths sister twin venus has relatively similar size earth and actually the closest distance earth scientist believe althought not able land venus that venus has similar surface earth well scientist say that venus has rocky surface and the article says features such valleys mountains and creates paragraph with this also believed that venus once had oceans venus had oceans there chance that venus can support life its surface not only there possibility that venus might have had water the air pressure very similar the sea levels earth paragraph the article says the air pressure would close that sea level earth this means that those who lived venus would not crushed the weight the air pressure other planet the air pressure heavy enough crush person and not suitable live another reason that venus would suitable for humanity because the second planet the solar system and exposed lot sun light many people know there big need for energy earth result this the earth running out fossil fuel and that one the reasons the earth dying humanity lived venus there would big source solar energy which renewable energy but like everything there down side living close the sun venus the hottest planet our solar system even though mercury the closest planet the sun venus could melt many the metals that use our everyday lifes because venus the hottest planet the temperature can reach average degrees fahrenheit not only can the surface temperature high but there level carbon dioxide venus atmosphere scientist have proven that humans would only withstand three weeks venus because these conditions even though there are many things stopping from living venus now there are still many things that not know about the earth twin there still much more explore venus but for now know that the air pressures similar earths sea level pressure close the sun having planty solar power and once believed have oceans and support life and one day venus might need become our new home but until then the human race will stay earth,4

the facial action coding system can help computers identify the emotions people for instance poeple can somewhat calculate emotions just like any math equation secondly the facs also helpful becasue can tell are forcing smile not finally this also can tell people like just smiling and also tell dislike people frown leonardo vinci renaissance painting the mona lisa computers have already found out that she was putting forced smile the painting mona lisa researchers have calculated the emotions the drawing mona lisa was only percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent anger according the facs software then can calculate the emotions people just looking the esters one person makes all major muscles the modèle must move like human muscles lastly computers might able know when you are happy sad for instance you smile when web apperson your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different these are examples how the facs can valuable the classrooms readers may say that facs can not work normal computer according this research states that your home can not handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile also not only can computers decode the smile people make humans around the world can also see forca smile not whoever thought that making faces could reveal much about the science emotions but not all computer software can identify emotions just like this evidence each expression compared against neutral face theory can tell that the facs software does indeed work tell the emotions the drawing leonardo vinci having the software calculate emotions just like math problems also evaluating are forcing smile not just our esters our facial expections the facs software can useful for people who would like use this figure out other people are forcing smile not then confirm that person did did not force smile,3
the article think that the image the face mars just landform the nasa workers think that that the face was created aliens don think when says the article the camera the board mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face perhaps said skeptics alien markings were hidden haze from the image they took don see anything that has with aliens and they think the holes and landforms are made from aliens well they are not because one aliens don exist and two holes can their because meteoroids also how think the face natural landform the mount next doesn look like face just looks like regular normal landform could been from meteoroid that fell they think that aliens made those mount they need prove with images the rover going around mars because what they are saying about the holes and the face hasn fasted one bit the top image the article shows the images throughout the years left middle and right the first image which was taken viking does look like face first but you never know they probably used camera that wasn really good and the image was blurry think that why the landform looks like face the second image which was taken viking little more clear but also still looks like face but starting fade away the nose mouth and eyes the third image which was taken nasa does not look like face all the landform has all kinds cracks and lines the mount with the images the article says twenty five years ago something funny happened around mars that was twenty five years ago when they took that photo that proves that that time they didn have all kinds cool techology take photos that are really clear unlike they had really good technology take clear images take photo the mount whatever you think when they say that the aliens made the face you might not want with because they might research but they also might assume what right away and how they thought was face they might not had good technology the and they still believed when they took the picture and they even have good technology now don know they still believe now but they that suprising when people put anything online about how they think something don believe until you see yourselves either the computer book but you don have with what everyone saying just because they think that look yourself and you don think the image compared what they think the image that doesn matter you think different who you are and what your imagination tells you what the object image color etc that what makes you special your own way,3
the authors supporting details pretty well the author want study the planet his supporting detail are pretty good the text states often referred earth twin venus the closet planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance the datil really infesting third grader can really interested and would like read more thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater thn what experience our own planet usually get lost half the paragraph now but because well written just want ead more the authors has really good supporting details reader will know what would talking about what mean would think that lot student would interested study other planets because thus article well written,2
the face landform and not created aliens faceoff landform human face because first all aliens are not real even thought alien are real the face that the scientists described was like human face which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth paragraph the look the face already gives lot information that human face also said that looked like egyptian pharaoh paragraph only this one had unsual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh almost every evidence showed that was formed human face even thought some scientist belived that the face was alien artifact they can prove what the pint saying that alien face with just some litte bits details are aliens even real also the article unmasking the face mars said that there was alien monument after all paragraph after the moc team took picture ten ties then the original viking photos showed that was revealing natural landform said the cuticle that the camera board mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face perhaps said skeptics alien markings were hidden haze even thought they believe that could alien okay could hiding the details alien marking but the article said that what the picture actually the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west that evidence that showed that was from human face also this article unmasking the face mars had more information how human face and how isn alien face,2
human learning and comprehension goes far beyond textbook why still value and use old methods teaching when there technology being made help with that professors and researchers beckman institute and the university amsterdam have teamed create computer that runs series complex algorithms determine the emotion persons face using emotionless model comparison this was used learning environment such classroom can greatly improve understanding and learning where lessons confuse kids and how teacher not the computer can help child with certain learning curb this technology could offer provide alternative learning methods change the lesson bit fit certain childs needs many teachers are busy helping other kids grading schoolwork that lot oftentimes feel left out and not succeed with lack understanding this tech sure shows promising results but may not flawless one algorithm facial reading might wrong since only reads whats the outside and not whats actually inside the mind person let alone child there also substitute for actual teachers learning and teaching when comes confused child that open about where the confusion arose the first place the facs facial action coding system can step where other primitive human minds fail the system stores known facial expressions and emotions such happiness sadness anger disgust fear and surprise since this system programed recognize facial expressions and emotions its easier for figure out what someone feeling faster rather than teacher some persons guesswork can provide fast and easy solutions child problem his her study this can integrated into almost every classroom and reach every kid that class individually without waste teaching time probability this seems great for anyone who has money because with this reasearch and development doesnt seem free thats one issue with this technology not widespread and might hinder any success slim chances actually making into class room most schools nowadays just got new promethean boards that one can only assume old technology this technology would most likely take years reach classroom not for commercial use many school districts and cities not have big enough budget spend such tech since any other old style teaching and underpaid teachers are cost effective all all think this technology would actually really help wide range children and teachers classrooms after few years development and reasearch greatly expand the learning horizon and bring down costs,4
opinion think that the electoral college method should abolished because with the presidential elections are quite useless specifically talking about the way presidents get popular votes the system very out dated and very irrational when the founding fathers founded this country they said that the people america get voice and say everything well not everything but still their own say during the presidental elections are useless the only real true thing vote for the senate electors for the presidential elections since the electoral college process mainly controlled the senate the senators vote for the presidential canidate you see the only way candidates actually win the every year elections november the amount votes they get not the people but the senators that pleged with them during the electoral college this essay explain why this system bad for our today world and how can lead false moves and corruption first off what exactly the electoral college not place more like process choosing and voting for presidential canidate you see the votes that regular citizens not count the actual votes though back then the system did work doesn today back then around the and mid century this electoral college system worked outstanding for time mainly because first america was new country and the senate that did the voting and choosing were well educated and have experience most citizens the american states weren really that educated very well mostly for new borns since the nation just finished their revolution and they were still debt the time and not everybody was rich enough afford anything turn they have knowlege the way the world now works then during the civil war half the country became another country known the confederate states america which opposed the ideals more freer nation other half the country known the united states america the electoral college did help president abe elected though was mainly because was popular since used the ideal abolishing and freeing slaves gain popularity and alot people opposed him become president but thanks the college process won the elections and united the two nations into the united states america does this will today world absolutely not doesn work and will never work unless america gets and become false and brainwashed utopia due our general corrupt society the right president get denied and the corrupt and wrongful citizen gets elected can relate this issue with the presidential election crisis the elections gore gets the most popular votes infact much more then george bush that was clear can easily win the elections but since the electoral college still intact they voted for george bush and bush won the elections more votes then the popular and better organized president gore because this most america got economy train wreck from and also wasted many resources the war terror battle from which now gone and has similar operation that still going called operation enduring freedom also unlike the old times when america was new country today modern century america can assure you that have percent the population educated our today educational standards tops which means that america doesn need hand when voting for new president and that shows that the electoral college not needed anymore anytime the governments and people today are also very corrupt times this will also include the electoral college and can affect many lives for many people everybody can now make their own choice thanks our very effective education system this proves the college group now useless for voting finally that why should abolish like bob dole said can cause lots corruption and was only made for time since that time many people were educated and couldn even read and now day today society very well off educated minds and has enough corruption and that the nutshell this essay and this why should remove the electoral college its unfair and unfit for today world and society the american government,4
the challenge exploring venus the debate the exploration venus exposed for discussion the article brings many controverisal topics discussing whether not venus worth exploring though most the article talks about the dangers and overall negatives venus has offer when comes exploring the author takes this information and turns into positives the author demonstrates that although venus dangerous and almost impossible explore attempting just that willl well worth the long run due this the readers can say that the author supported the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well the article the author first brings the fact that venus has very toxic and dangerous atmosphere they say that because this the conditions venus are far extreme for any human survive then the author even posses the question why are scientists trying explore venus more inhospitable the author uses this question transition into how they support the exploration venus saying how despite the inhospitable environment venus has many earth like qualities which intrigues many astronomers the article the author states venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth this shows that learning more about venus could potentially great advantage earth since the most similar planet earth the entire solar system second problem the author states about exploring venus that every attempt explore the planet has failed one reason being how the extreme heat has prevented each spacecraft survive for more than couple hours venus surface the article the author states spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours maybe this issue explains why not single spacecraft has touched down venus more than three decades the author contradicts this later the article explaining the technological advancements that nasa has accomplished help prevent having another failed mission venus the author states nasa working other approaches studying venus for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions this demonstrates how even though venus about impossible explore technology can help create smarter alternatives for exploring the planet surface throughout the article the author demonstrates that the positives exploring venus outweigh the negatives giving strong evidence why the positives eliminate the problems when comes exploring venus surface although there are many major issues with exploring venus the author shows the readers that there are solutions that can help fix these problems not only does the author this but they show how earth can discover and learn many valuable things about venus that can help the long run through very strong evidence about the positive that was able outweigh the negative the author was able support the idea studying venus very well,4

prof thomas huang prof nicu sabe and paul eckman have come with techonology that can know exactly what and how many emotions person has right now this technology called the facial action coding system facs students would benefit from this technology because the facs would know they were bored confused modify the lesson like real teacher and help the student understand the lesson better and earn good grade result the facs would know the student was bored confused because constructs detailed image the face with all major muscles then compares the image the image neutral face with emotion and looks certain muscles the computer looks the zygomatic major for example see you are smiling genially becasue the corners your mouth would pulled back would also look for your frontalis pars lateralis tell you are suprised something because your eyebrows would raised the facs would also able measure exactly how many emotions you have because the technology weighs different units student was bored confused the facs would able modify the lesson therefore helping the student understand the lesson more the computer now would not know the student was having trouble becasue can not see what the student face look like but with the help the facs the computer knows what the student feeling and can change what the lesson about help the student just like real teacher the facs would know what the student was thinking and able change how the lesson was worded hopefully help the student understand what was saying the facal action coding system would able modify the lesson just like experienced and effective teacher would with the facial action coding system modifying the lesson the student would earn better grade result than the lesson was not modified the student would most likely better both the homework and the test because the lesson was reworded much more impactful way than was originally the student does better the homework and test then the overall grade would increase well the percentage passing grades for the class the facs would modify the lesson thereby increasing the amount passing students and helping the school earn better grade from the department education the facs would able see student was confused bored and she bored confused modify the lesson accordingly therefore increasing the overall grade the student received the facial action coding system would able help the student she was confused rewording the lesson iin the way the student would understand better the facs would great addition classroom because would help the students understand what the lesson was saying,4

dear florida senator would say lets get rid the electoral college vote the reason because the voters vote for slate electors they really are not letting the people speak their mind about who should really president like said the story and quote sometimes the slate electors might vote for the other side also says the passage that the electoral college vote unfair outdated and irrational the electoral college vote just waste time honest another reason why think should get rid the electoral college vote because really doesn make any sense have the popularity vote should the one that counts the reason because gives the voters the chance vote for the president instead having that electoral college vote where they can just easily just vote for the new president the other thing that the electoral college votes goes slate electors well some states have more electors than others like california and texas all states should have equal amount voters instead just giving the big states the all the power the last reason why think should get rid the electoral college vote because the disaster factor the year fiasco was the biggest election crisis segregationists louisiana the legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors who would oppose john kennedy the other thing what their tie between the two the whole election would thrown the house representives these are all the reasons why think should get rid the electoral college votes because more easy doing the popularity vote because gives the people speak who they want president,3

the new software update the facial action coding system can calculable how people feel what emotion they are feeling this software the lastest invention from prof the six basic emotions humans have can read showed this facial action coding system this new technology being tested see valuable the classroom read the emotional expressions students belive this technology wouldn valuable the classroom learning enviroment this technology doesnt benefit the students learning relate their school subjects facial action coding system can calculate human emotional expressions calculates how you feel waht you are feeling don think this software would valuable the classroom because invading the kids personal space having the teachers the computers always knowing how you feel creepy the artifical making mona lisa simile states that humans perform this task calculation reading people emotions everyday the artifical also states that humans most likley can tell how others how their friends are feeling looking their facal expressing having facial acton coding system the classroom would just necesssary and invading others personal space this software technology only reads humans emotional expressions does teach anything help people learn anything benefiting school this technology was put into classrooms wouldnt benefiting the kids teaching them anything related their school work the artifical states that the computer would able tell when student confused bored while doing gleason most schools don even teach reasons the computer teacher teaches them the gleason they are learning also some kids even their parents wouldn want computer reading their childrens emotions also the students may not want monitored all the time aswell this technology just isn beneficial the learning enviroment that sort way the software update the facial action coding system cool how reads humans emotions and tells you how they are feeling but just isn valuable classrooms the learning enviroment this software invades others person sace always monitoring their emotional expressions and calculating how feel some people might find creepy the fact they are always being read this new technology this new technology isn valuable classrooms also because not benfica kids learning the facial action coding system doesnt teach kids treating their school subjects teachers teach the reasons and not computers this software would necessary classrooms,4
hard imagine car free car limiting cities but could happen the near future many people like owning and driving cars however cars are causing major problems some areas the world could see less cars the future one the biggest issues that cars cause the carbon emissions that they release america the second largest source emissions are from cars source this doesnt seem like issue americans but places like beijing china which one the most polluted cities the world source emissions are very harmful citizens beijing have wear mask when they walk around the city that they don get sick poisoned from the carbon emissions even world country like france had carbon emissions that rivaled beijing source you can see the emissions that cars give off could become more serious issue america especially you live place like new york city more cities become less congested they will much safer speaking new york city cars are already big issue you have been new york city you should know that the streets are congested with traffic that faster walk ride bike get around the city not only are the streets congested the air very polluted from the emissions given off cars however vauban germany residents are giving their cars for streets that are mostly car free source few residents own cars and that means that the streets are quiet and clear and greenhouse emission have drastically decreased residents say that they are happier without cars and everything they need within walking distance source this could quite possibly what happens many cities and suburbs the near future the last thing that would like fill you that car ownership america has been steadily declining research has shown that the number young peole driving has decreased percent between and source because this many people use public transport get where they need this likely due the fact that many americans don have the money buy cars they don make priority source also young people feel less inclined drive because they can connect with their friends through the internet source means saying that you should not own car just explaining you that car limited future looking more and more possible many ways could very beneficial but still has long way before can see becoming reality,5

you think that computer can read how feel can some sort help you school answer yes can enhancement technology happening sooner and sooner they started with system called facs facs known for facial action coding system the creator facs paul eckman huang had many predictions based off video imagery and how would work the facs system was created for sensing emotions from imagery eckman classified six emotions happiness suprise anger disgust fear and sadness then tried associate them with facial muscles getting different facial expressions each facial expression tells how person feeling for example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when your suprised this means that when your feeling certain way your muscles react creating this code system helps them with trying figure out how others are feeling there facial expressions working towards facial emotion expressions while front computer huang made few predictions and conclusions based off the work psychologists one the psychologists was paul eckman huang states that the facial expression for each emotion are universal also states that even though individuals often show varying degrees expression meaning happens all the time even though there are all types forms expressions while using video imagery can sense the facial movements still image real face create these thoughts about others daily you can tell whether person happy sad mad etc the text states you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face they use mona lisa show how these things work from computer huang also predicts classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confuse bored computer facial recognition would great for the society who knows just might improve others doing there work yes maybe hassle get everything together but time everything will fall place technology improves the days that technology will impact the world just one facial expression could tell all,4
the electoral college system electing our president created our founding fathers when they were writing the constitution lately though people have opposed the electoral college due the election when gore beat george bush the popular vote but lost the electoral vote and seat president based many sources not support the electoral college because the lack direct link from the public the election the president and the unfairness towards voters not support the electoral college because lack direct link from the public the election the president instead the public voting for the president they are voting for group electors who turn elect the president the problem with that that the group electors can anyone not holding the public office but just case dishonest electors states hold state conventions pick the electors but even after this voters still can not control who their state electors vote for sometimes electors get confused about who someone voted for and put them down for candidate different from whom they originally voted for now could avoid all this trouble just did away with electoral college and had direct vote for president and have the election the people and for the people instead the people and for the electors not support the electoral college because the unfairness towards the voters due the winner take all system each state candidates for president don focus winning every state instead they focus only winning the swing states states whose political party support constantly changing the presidential election the presidential candidates didn see states including but not limited rhode island and south carolina and the largest media markets voters didn see single presidential campaign this another good reason get rid the electoral college based this evidence believe the electoral college should done away with because lack direct link the election the president and the unfairness towards voters,3
opinion this wold driverless car deal that not terrible idea just don see much offer besides car that just waste time the road for everyone else they have test the car better and understand that just that maybe not ready for cars like this soon time goes humans are more dependant technology and can that forever sometimes good for not rely much with cars drive ourselves around and are alwaye focused the road and what around all times become more alert way now with self driving cars sort loose that awareness being alert all the time while the road this idea another great idea keep the crash records down but doesn change the fact that humans almost everyday depend everything something for matter how simple humans are getting lazier and lazier every new invention that being produced sometimes bad sometimes good but this case kind bad thing because another thing that thing can for untill they can find way that this will truly work will against,2
imagine world where you literally don need thing where supposedly you are safer world with driverless cars roaming your streets more technology will only increase the risks getting into accident first off strongly disagree with this concept whole the story says can you imagine time the future when ones buys cars because one needs them anymore even doesn say but start produce driverless cars then how will able travel through the country feet yes will save money from paying much for fuel also will getting things much later meanwhile google has built cars where they are somewhat driverless but still need human skills moments paragraph further explains google cars aren driverless they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents this was around and later google picks their game now bmw can function higher speed and has special sensors this just shows that basically don need the car but they have yet made that point the near future google wants have other options for example paragraph other options under consideration are flashing lights the windshield and other heads displays manufactures are also considering using cameras watch that drivers are remaining focused the road while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver there reason for this happening society this going increase more accidents because our ignorance all all there were driverless cars roaming around the streets then this will bad place live the reason for disagreeing with this strongly base health the driverless cars today shouldn even named driverless cars because they don come close the more advancements add the more dangerous the car becomes just sitting the drivers seat and letting the car take over plain just nonsense flying cars something would agree now that safer,3
the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers since spacecraft survived the landing more than few hours maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging plant for humans study despite its proximity one reason the author says this because the atmosphere almost percent carbon blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the plant surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet another reason the author says this because venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer our sun beyond high pressure and heat venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land its surface the third and final reason the author says this because even though venus has its horrible and dangers things there are also good reason why should study astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like plant our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form life just like earth today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth conclusion striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors our travels earth and beyond shouldn limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,3
true that there will lot benefits having driverless cars the future utilizing this invention could mean less human error the roads having those cars used public transportation could really convenient since everyone will have access form transportation especially those who not have car begin with but driverless cars might too reliable although this all well and good there are challenges and hurdles driverless cars will have the community safety will still concern some people any chance driverless cars are widely used and completely implemented our civilization new laws will made involving the safety people when driverless car and everyone completely abandoned the concept driving manually now what everything else fails and one day the driverless cars stopped working one will able get their own destinations with ease you will also never know when these machines will malfunction since they are completely automatic terms driving unless the issues are solved and driverless cars are safe and reliable enough should not used the community yet this technology still new and poeple just started working driverless cars people should bit forgiving and okay give negative opinions about just means those are the things they need fix and could help them improve driverless cars agree that driver should given option for drivers drive and use autopilot simply giving feature turning and off still not have good feeling relying machines completely machines might rarely making mistakes but they are far too unpredictable unlike having humans behind the wheel which again one the reasons people have concern about and requested laws and regulations from the government conclusion technology great but should not controlling our way life daily basis too much than necessary,3
venus very interesting planet because has many features like the earth but very dangerous many are interested see whats and wonder risk should take visit venus venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers because the most earth like planet our solar system venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains craters furthermore venus can sometime our nearest option for planetary visit venus has many risks because venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system can get any rock gas anything else from distance the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth peering venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions because the most forms photography and videography ineffective scientists seeking conduct through mission understand venus would need get close and personal despite the risks despite all the risks for visiting venus one heck accomplishment for being able understand venus and explore the planet venus venus has many pros visit for all the information for the future and knowing what can similar the earth maybe there living organisms,3
believe that making decision develop even introduce the idea having computers read our emotions wrong and creepy what would the point one likes ads having your computer read your face just bring more makes sense when you can get pop ads that can relate recent searches would waste time and waste money and energy this would not valuable this coding system read emotions would completely useless think having take out every computer every school just add feature know your smiling frowning makes sense when already have phones that have face face recognition that can that for when the article started using examples different muscles the face that was confusing and seemed pointless know this accurate system app they should just make and let find out for ourselves think using anything that has with our face when comes technology unlocking our devices for privacy rather know device safe from own face then password keyboard that can readily accessed rotten down think about adding this mentioned feature the system reading your emotions you have computer tell you what your own personal emotions are but how accurate can this says you are feeling certain way and you feel something completely different then this considered fale advertising this going app entire software system you can easily access your windows chrome web browser store and get free download even pay for will app because guarantee one will pay high amount money just they can have computer read you your own emotions its pointless and would have effect besides unlocking your system device what someone passes and grabs part their face what the things around you grab ahold the system and produces false information understand maybe shows anger boredom can remind you keep working but what students have concentration problems really bad and cant focus like everyone elsen the program still doesnt help just keep those kids lost this program seems like insane waste time just have feedback how they think you feel just because lips eyes are certain position doesnt mean feeling that way could the best mood ever and move muscles into shape and would the results same would they real what actually feel will come back happy and faking think scientists should invest their money time and effort into something that would actually help instead something that has value and pointless classrooms the workplace general,4
the author did very well supporting his idea about how wants study the planet venus despite the danger venus presents makes sense why venus should studied venus our sister planet has many features that the earth has see why the author wants study this planet because very similar earth paragraph four says venus still has some features that are analogous those earth also has some examples what the similarities are like rocky sediment mountains and craters the author has some doubts about going venus and studying because may dangers but like also says paragraph four the value returning venus seems indisputable but what are the options for making such mission both safe and scientifically productive venus for all know may not such risk can say that though because venus has the hottest temperature any planet venus has proven that very challenging place examine more closely even being the author did support the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit venus planet that everyone should learn about and reading this will make you curious see earth sister planet the author gives good details about venus and supporting like said the first paragraph venus has many features that also earth has would good study planet like venus,3

self driving cars everybody wants car that can drive itself but really practical many people say that self driving cars are thing the future while others argue that they should not exist autonomous cars are not practical and should not the road because they are dangerous impractical and boringly monotonous self driving cars are dangerous because they will not able sense detect danger wells humans could presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times cars are not safe under the care atomized vehicles due the fact that there are too many variables and sporadic possibilty when driving now other than dangerous they are also very impractical early forms self driving cars such traffic jam assistant are examples how impractical they are the car can handle driving functions speeds mph this very slow speed and seems almost useless along with only going mph self driving cars also require you keep your hands the wheel all times why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver add driverless cars being impractical automated cars would make road trips very boring and dull the psychological aspects automation are really challenge admits werner huber bmw project manager driver taking road trips would the only thing that comes mind when thinking why you would need driverless car and then even road trips would become very repetitive and bland have interpret the driving fun new way this shows that autonomous cars would take the fun out taking road trips all all autonomous cars are not the next big thing and are potentially huge safety hazard driver assistance may something that could useful drivers with impairments but driverless cars taking the next level without roads pair with these cars the use driverless cars impractical and not down earth out there and show your car some appreciation and give test drive completely automated,3
let explain fellow citizens about the advantages limiting car usage the reason say this because german suburb life goes without cars paris bans due smog and car free day spinning into big hit bogota german they dont really care for cars street parking driveways and home garages are generally forbidden this experimental new distrito the outskirt freiburg near the french and swiss borders there roads and sidewalks are mainly free they dont many cars german the only people that was really allowed have cars were car owners but but there were ony places park large garages the edge the development that casted along with home some people felt like they were always tense when they had car they like not having car they wouldn have pay for the high gas they need for their gas tank they felt like walking was way better was exercise and was more calming then being stuck traffic paris bans driving because many people are getting smuggled after days near record pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city they were caught driving they would getting fine really big fine almost drivers were fined according reuters people had their cars impounded for their reaction the fines people wasnt taking their car reviles being taking well they felt like they needed their cars get point point but they understood why they could drive their cars they knew was for their own safty well atleast some knew was conclusion now fellow citizens know how people felt about the advantages limiting car usage,2
what venus some people called the evening star but not venus actually planet was nearby earth but they have safe distance between them venus had the hottest temperature any planet and human can near the ground venus venus had the hottest temperature any planet solar system there had any living things can survive according the article the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet also notable venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system the temperature average the surface venus over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times more than earth venus has the hottest surface temperature the any planet the solar system human can not near the ground venus the temperature and air pressure according the article nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray thiry plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth some possible solution the hottest temperature surface venus the national aeronautics and space administration allow the scientists forat above the ground the more miles above the surface the temperature still around degrees fahrenheit like toasty but the air pressure was close the sea level earth those are not easy conditions but survivable for humans venus had the hottest temperature any planet and human can near the ground venus has many hostile conditions for human survivable the temperature venus more lower human may stay the new planet,4
cars are very large help for transportation although they have alot defects our environment our laziness and our safety the first reason should limit car use our environment doesn get ruined the fumes our vehicles are relapsing into the air are creating large addition the greenhouse gases for example semis diesel cars diesel trucks and other vehicles when you rev the gas pours out black smoke into the environment when you see truck this you think nothing but overtime and with every single car and truck that does adds very quickly another reason should limit our car usage because increases our laziness instead driving school when only minutes away you could just walk you walked you would lose little weight and even saving your gas money you are close the place you want then you might well just walk benefits you many ways saving money losing weight and getting more fit one the most important reasons should limit our car usage for our own safety deaths car accidents one the most leading causes death now days would you rather walk ride bike the location you want would you rather risk your life driving and somebody deboning you and injuring even killing you not that you should but some people sometimes can get into crash with you and then just drive off whether was your fault theirs now you have pay for the damages done your vehicle you are going drive because you live far away from everything simply car pull alot easier and everyone throws down little money then you aren spending that much gas diesel riding bike great solution limiting car usage because one time purchase once you buy the bike you don have pay for fuel also better than walking because far faster general driving has advantages and disadvantages although you are close your location then riding bike would ideal lower car usage,2
new computer software designed thomas huang can detect emotions just scanning the face everyday many people hide their emotions but with this new software even the slightest bit discomfort anguish can recognized classrooms this innovation will useful for many reasons for many years students have been confused the classroom too afraid ask questions about particular subject however this new software can detect when student confused thus making the lesson easier for the student understand the text states that the classroom computer can also recognize when student becoming bored also modifying the lesson become more entertaining although this new software groundbreaking may have some negative effects for instance teachers and professors may lose their jobs students will longer feel the need ask questions schools may start replace teachers with more computers with this software therefore causing lesser demand for teachers although this may not happen for while this concept should still worrisome and also brought forward this new innovation however should used more and more everyday for the results are truly remarkable students will longer confused bored class and certain ads can changed preference video games and other media can also more enjoyable for these reasons this software should not rejected others conclusion the new emotion recognition software very useful not only professionally but also many homes this technology advance may also provide key unlocking emotions that may not have ever been thought about,3
cars were created transport humans their desired destination see need for driverless cars when cars were ment driven why need driverless cars anyway don know how reliable the technology the driver still has remain alert and one knows who blame when someone gets hurt computers crash everyday elevators breakdown escalators stop escalating technology breakdown all these things can happen everyday who say something like that won happen these cars the brakes could stop you right the middle busy intersection the google car wakes you only seconds before you run into semi truck for the driverless car mimic the skill human the wheel exactly they mimic humans which unreliable what the point driverless car the human driver has stay awake the only reason one could see driverless car useful they were only created that the passangers could sleep this also means that the cars aren equipped handle difficult situations and they aren advanced enough handle that then they shouldn allowed the streets the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over what you are deep sleeper and you don hear the warning you would die that what would happen your fault your fault that what judges across the country across the world would hearing the driverless car went market and had accident the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer who fault the person who made the car that malfunctioned the person who intervened trying save themselves and the car only have backfire making things worse this would then lead long trial draining both parties lot money why would anyone put themselves through that just they don have drive themselves places people should not subject themselves product run unreliable technology that keeps you awake and leaves you bankrupt the end the day there are other luxuries life that come with less conditions try them because continuing the development driverless cars pointless,4
the idea having driverless cars interesting the thought not having worry about the dangers being the road when your car the one doing all the work for you there are many positives having the driverless car but there are many negative there positive sergey brin google confounds envisions future with public transportation system imagines this system become form public taxi transport brin idea allows the vehicles use half the fuel that taxis use today and offers more flexibility than bus google created car google has had cars that could drive under specific conditions and their cars have driven more than half million miles without having crash now ideas the driverless car were sparked the idea movies companies have tried make the driverless car work but one has made driverless car that doesn need the assistance the driver yet companies started question wasn the car that wasn making their project work and maybe was the roads that the cars were driving the late general motors created car that could only run special track that was embedded with electrical cables the cables sent radio signal the front the car the smart road system worked exceptionally well but the upgrade new roads would simply too expensive there are many car manufacturing companies working the progress making driverless cars happen but the cars still need the drivers alert watch out for pedestrians other motorists and etc our form transportation evolving right before our own eyes and its quite exciting know that the time college driverless cars won just idea that thought would have been nearly impossible accomplish,3
dear senator the electoral college process that the founding fathers established compromise between the election the president vote congress and popular vote the people this process involves selecting the electors meeting with the electors and counting the votes congress there are electors total the electoral college the presidential election happens every four years the tuesday after the first monday november after the election the governor makes certificate ascertainment which has all the names the candidates who ran for president believe should keep the electoral college because there certainty outcome helps avoid run off elections and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote the outcome electoral college has possibility creating dispute like but this dispute less likely happen over dispute over the popular vote this because the winning candidates share the electoral college greater than his share the popular vote obama recieved percent the electoral vote comparison the percent popular votes for him and mitt romney trans regional appeal required the electoral college got rid the electoral college then there would greater possibility dispute furthermore nixon and clinton both had percent plurality the popular votes while winning majority the electoral college this proves that the electoral college avoids the problems elections which neither candidate receives majority the votes when candidate wins majority the pressure complicates the presidential election process the electoral college minimized this pressure invariably producing clear winner every time majority electoral votes required elect the president addition large state gets more attention from candidates than small sate campaign example obama got electoral votes wyoming the winner only had electoral votes the same marin obama the electoral college provides some kind restoration for the weight the political balance that large states lose mal apportionment the senate voters toss states are more likely read into and pay more attention campaign because they know they are going decide the election most likely that these people are going the the most thoughtful voters conclude there are many reasons keep the electoral college this process has made the winner the election much clearer decide there are lot pros and cons the electoral college but the list cons way shorter than the list all the pros the electoral college should keep the electoral college because creates certainty outcome diminishes run off elections and creates balance for the bigger states the electoral college has created positive impact for our presidential election sincerely proper name,4

slip into world where emotions are easily read there could mind games pettiness and suffering silence this could the new reality the article making mona lisa smile nick alto introduces new concept created thomas chaung facial action coding system software this programming system allows computers register all the emotions individual face regardless they are mixed while some argue that this facial action coding system step too far into innovative future the advanced program could benefit multitude areas thomas chaung new software would not only find usages classroom but also daily life granting teacher access their student feelings could give teacher insight how well their concept are grasping further prove the computer effectiveness huang states classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor alto addition assisting classroom setting enabling people read other emotions would beneficial also reading into surroundings helps people grow knowing what feelings individual possesses could compel someone more considerate act accordingly how that individual feels with that mind this program could also strengthen relationships although the facial coding acting system invades privacy lessons human interaction and may not completely accurate human emotions ultimately serves benefit while privacy concerns are understandable the possible results after the slight invasion could more than worth unfortunate day could quickly turned around people were aware the circumstances without situation being addressed nothing can fixed the same goes for person emotional state however the technological aspect how can one know how reliable computer detecting somebody facial expression huang addresses this introducing that the computer first constructs model the face with all the muscles operating human would huang also explains that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal regardless the degree expression alto finally the fear more computer based activities rapidly squashed the contradiction that being more aware should evoke more human interaction not lesson initially the thought additional advancement technology frightening predicting ideas not always sure way indicating what will occur however after huang introduces and explains his new concept facial action coding system technology arduous reject the placement this software into everyday life hopefully the program will installed soon can start making improvements various industries across the board,5

the use technology read students expressions good could help students focus school and help teachers help student with subjects they don understand when students are aware they not paying attention subject they try pay more attention least make seem like they are the text states according the facial feedback theory emotion moving your facial muscles not only express emotions but also may even help produce them this shows that even pretending focus just showing your face might also help you focus what going teachers can aslo benefit from this technology well when they teach class they can look over the students emotions and see what the teachers can different make the students understand pay attention the text states classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored this shows that the computer can show information about students emotion which would help the teachers create better lesson plans some may argue saying this would invasion students privacy and that would unfair the student would better make each student sign contract that would want have their emotions monitored and have those who wouldn want could just not sign the contract conclusion the use technology read student expressions would valuable because could help students pay attention and help teachers help the students,3
the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states over percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now and yet the electoral college still has its defenders the electoral college also has some good reasons keep our despised method choosing the president the election obama received percent the electoral vote compared only percent the popular votes obama won cause the electoral college because almost all states award electoral votes winner take all basis even very slight plurality state creates landslide electoral vote victory that state one good reason the certainty outcome also another awesome reason that the electoral college requires presidental candidate have transregional appel regions has enough electoral votes elect president the south cant elect president that will something favor with the south only the electoral college avoids the problem elections which candidate receives majority the votes cast avoids run off elections final answer that argue favor the electoral college would hard let every single citizen chose because some people dont think about others and what good for all people only think about themself and what good for themself plus the even though the president will win matter she won the popular vote the electoral votes think for the state and what good for the people,2
since the time its discovery the face mars has baffled many people its resemblance face has caused gain much popularity which has even led movie being made about unfortunately though there are people that would like believe the face sign alien life mars they have named and stated number arguments about why sign and even have claimed nasa hiding from the public this not true however the face simply just peculiar looking landform yet several counter arguments and points must made drive home the fact that the face just landform many theories that the face sign alien life mars have been spawned the creation books magazines and even movies that have been made about almost all the stories these things tell about the face are science fiction with key emphasis the fiction part sadly though some people have chosen accept these ideas made author producer the truth most the theories about the face were made for good stories the people that their books and magazines would sell more but one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the face sign alien life mars the people who claim theories that aren from commercialized stories regarding how the face sign alien life are little more credible than the others yet still can easily proven wrong this because their main and many cases only argument centers around photograph the face when another photograph was taken however the picture showed that was simply just landform one counter argument this that the camera must malfunctioned the picture wasn clear enough which there one fact that makes that counter argument dissolve the camera reportedly snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos which would lead the assumption that the photo wasn clear that true then the face mars actually isn face all simply put the face natural martian landform conclusion the face mars certainly interesting landform but case sign alien life mars all theories about how sign aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven and has been further proven through updated pictures that just landform even though finding sign alien life would have been more interesting one must always stick the facts know the correct solution,5
should the facial acting coding system allowed classrooms with students think can very helpful easy non verbal quick communication the students understand the infomation being given lastly they are comfortable with their surroundings the classroom teachers usually give long lesson within this time span easy for students lose attention and not focus just get confused using the facial action coding system can show the teachers how well they are teaching shows that the students are not quit getting the teacher can have them stand walk around get drink paragraph six says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication the facial action coding system would reduce the amount time takes resolve problem with student you know exactly how they are feeling you can give them what they need change thier mood there would not even communication you can just look all his emotions the system and know how fix his emotions change them the system can also tell they are comfortable with the people they are around what they doing someone not comfortable they wont their best work you can see that they are uncomfortable with the system you can move them ask them why they are uncomfortable for example paragraph five says fact humans perform this same impressive calculation every day for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face humans can tell little bit emotion but not percent and what change conclusion think should have the facial action coding system all classrooms helps with telling students emotions whether they understand the information being given whether they are comfortable with what going the class lastly gives quick nonverbal communication for quick changes the class yes the facial action coding system should all classes for the reasons have stated,3
the author does not give give well enough support the idea studying the planet venus worthy pursuit the author gives the dangers the planet the article and does give interesting facts about the planet but does not make sound safe enough try visit the planet itself there are various dangers this pursuit and does not make sound worth the risk the author provides evidence how the planet and facts about but does not state that possible for any object land the surface venus without being destroyed therefore provides some evidence that studying venus not worthy pursuit the author states the dangers venus the article and some examples the dangers from the text would stated paragraph such thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the text also states how temperatures venus can average over degrees and that right there proves how dangerous venus because humans can not survive that kind heat the text also states how environment like that would crush submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts the oceans earth the author provides good information how venus very dangerous planet but does not well enough support how worth studying the planet itself though scientists may fascinated the planet still not worth any risks due the dangers the text does state how there are some features venus that are similar the ones earth such valleys mountains and craters the planets also have similar size each other and occasionally have the closest distance each other too though this information quite fascinating does not provide information how venus worth visiting and studying studying venus not worthy pursuit from reading the last few paragraphs from the sound the author this seems with more opinion and personal interests rather than factual evidence and support the author does not make seem worthy study this planet ways has never been studied before such going there and exploring the surface for long time and exploring more than just small area but discovering and studying larger parts the planet because without actually seeing just about every inch the planet there way knowing what the planet itself which makes bit more dangerous but also makes humans very curious yes people may fascinated the planet and would like achieve the goal exploring the surface venus for awhile but knowing the dangers this planet surface and atmosphere not physically possible scientists try with machines consistently but those machines not even last for more than few hours around this planet proving that extremely difficult task study the planet venus though scientists can continue try and make machines more compatible due knowing these certain facts about venus can make bit more possible study venus more but until then not worth any risks due the factual dangers this planet,4

why would need technology read our emotions against technology read students the technology read emotion useless and waste time not only that computers doesn know emotions unless operated and most time probably won right mostly students wise why how would influence our students grow and learn from that technology reading our emotions won benefit from anything but waste time and money our home can handle the complex algorithms that decode emotion which means advanced technology won have enough money support ourselves the school and student the article only gives reason examples how the software works not why needed paragraph states most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication nots huang why would have the need ask computer know how someone feeling computers aren human and won understand even was read our emotions they won truely understand how feel order for even the computer read our emotions need model the faces and learn human anatomy for the muscles structure all major muscles the model must move like human muscles human can already tell the difference between other humans being expression than why would have the need let computers know our emotions students wouldn learn anything from this technology huang and his colleague are experts developing better ways for humans and computers communicate wouldn want human interact more with other human being and explore each culture around the world more technology today already influencing lot connect with others and the technology around the world but more technology are invented humans would lose communication with other human beings opinion technology itself and ourself separating human beings from each other and more closer our technology human communication with another human more enjoyable and better than communicate with computers most would spend million bucks get the newest technology but not even thousand two out and explore the world interact with other humans being wouldn value the technology that will influence students when they won learn anything benefit from,4

believe that driverless cars are good for the future with technology improving every year very possible self driving cars would make traffic safer believe technology improving every year cars are getting very close driving their own here why think they are great have the future technology improves every year with new technology made being more improved since the technology has improved advanced the article said the automakers used speed sensors the wheels the creation antilock brakes within years those sensors had become more advanced detect and respond the danger out control skids rollovers also the radars sensors mapping and computers weren there build driver less car the radar that are put the google modified prius weren able put car before the year the cost for radar was two hundred million dollars and wasnt even small enough put car radars before were put hilltops now they have multiple radars one car that how far technology has advanced self driving cars would make traffic much safer believe with all the technology put car there would reduced amount accidents with all these sensor put car would able detect surroundings the dubbed lidar uses laser beams create constant model the car and its surroundings said the article has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object imagine years from now are gon na have technology that doesn alert the human stop but the car itself stops its own gets close car the light turns red pedestrian walks due its sensor cameras and software the will stop auto makers are getting closer and continuing their work create self driving car for the future mercedes benz audi and nissan are planning have cars that drive themselves tesla the other hand has projected car that capable driving its own percent the time said the article tesla has projected release for car caballe driving autopilot percent the time this great for the future aswell there technology only gon na advance the years and become percent caballe driving their own that why believe that driverless cars are marvelous idea for the future technology and has improved self driving cars will make traffic much safer cars are much closer driving there own since the that why feel very positive about self driving cars,4
think that the new technology facs which stands for facial action coding system valuable because knowing how others are feeling can help develop stronger relationships and bonds with friends and family and can also help person console another person they are feeling sad lonely and angry even the other person doesn show their true emotions feelings and the technology facs can recognize different human emotions such sadness happiness even the person face doesn have any emotion expressions and could also learn more how our emotions change from time time and why they change and could help develop better ways for humans and computers communicate and would help people that have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried and other emotions like that and may help with teaching students like say person bored they probably won learn much someone who isn bored that someone confused they don really learn anything and doesn really help them focus either but someone who isn confused isn bored will likely learn better than those who are confused bored something that the student likes interested they will likely listen and probably won confused nor bored but something that they don really like isn interesting them then they may not pay attention and may get bored and get confused and may help people learn and grow well and also the person learning doesn really like the lesson not interested bored confused then the computer can change the lesson something that the student will probably like and not bored confused with anything the lesson the computer can suggest something else another lesson for the student see they better the lesson and enjoy more and focus more can improve education and how well students know everything and can encourage good attitudes and positive things the present and the future also can help encourage people talk more often and make friends and also encourage people help others and things like that and maybe advise teachers way make the lesson their teaching more enjoyable and helpful playing games letting students have group partners help them and such and may help students have better grades better school and maybe even better extra curricular activities such sports and help student focus the things they need and help the teachers make lessons where will help the students learn better and more fun for them may also inspire people work harder more and different things and come with new different ideas and such and may even motivate the person something that they want accomplish possibly even pursue goals and dreams and technology can help with lot different things like understanding how things work and other things like that,3
the electoral college has been part america since the beginning but fair our country democracy which means for the people the people the electoral college not the people yes has historical value but longer what democracy because population changes and states being added the country begin with source states the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state there popularity vote and then the electoral college vote most citizens think that the popularity vote will win because that candidate the person that the people chose that not the case just depends basically how big your state and how popular candidate that state the population the biggest factor that the candidates think about because they win that state they are closer winning the election there are people who want abolish the electoral college including past presidents richard nixon and jimmy carter really just isn fair the people that who they vote for and who wins the popular vote may not have chance win because she did not get the electoral college votes addition source states the advocates this position are correct arguing that the electoral college method not democratic modern sense the electors who vote for president the people when you vote your state you are actually voting for elector and not the presidential candidate the popular vote was higher for gore than was for george bush but bush won the presidential election because had higher number electors the electoral college real democracy gore would have won because the fact was more popular the people want vote directly for the candidate they want not for some person that has been trusted vote for party nominee finally the electoral college kind fair way because based off population each state there also equal number electors source states the founding fathers established the electoral college the constitution compromise between election the president vote congress and election the president popular vote qualified citizens understand that law set the men who created our country and worked back then just isn working present day conclusion the electoral college was created the founding fathers back when the was small and didn have huge population like today worked back then but now there are states and millions people they want heard the popular vote would make more sense than having states with huge populations deciding the fate the election when should popularity the candidate need restore our democracy and have the election the people,5

the facial action coding system enables computers identify human emotions but this advanced system valuable particularly necessary opinion although this coding system brilliant there not need for the classroom the fact that live time where computers could calculate mood and emotions nothing short amazing but this coding system doesnt benefit the consumer all paragraph six alto gives example computer analyzing your mood you come across you come across happy smiling the computer will continue display like minded ads but your computer sees that you are frowning upon seeing the will direct you different ads now this great for the compan who sells whatever the they get literally profit this technology but what does for the one viewing ads nothing another example given paragraph six classroom setting haing states classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor not saying that this technology can not what claims but what does utterly unheeded classroom setting student becoming confused about certain topic they should raise their hand and ask teacher even online run courses always ave teacher there supervise they should seek out teacher guidance because least school district curriculum can not altered district made five different highschools all five teach the same exact math english and science curriculum the computer would not even permitted change lesson even was confused whats helpful about notification appearing screen saying thay about confused the answer simply its not conclusion although this software sounds very talented what capable achieving not useful the classroom this specific technology would quite honesty serve and fellow classmates use all what this software can what almost any human can achieve with sight and cognitive skills give valuable software that will give alternate youtube videos websites hellip confused not software that just tells confused,4
driverless cars are coming the author presents both positive and negative aspects driverless cars because could some people imagine time the future when nobody buys cars cause they don need anymore the author says google sergey brin can opinion negative couldn see myself anyone else without car the future and that okay aslo think postive way because maybe the future without cars wouldn bad but people would have walk alot did you know that some people didn know that television and movies have been the long fascinated with cars that could drive themself reality the author says cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since cars also havent driven more than half million miles without crash and that where some people would think driverless cars negative way because google cars aren truly driverless they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such road accidents the whole point cars driving themself starting get negative instead postive the reason say this because for example the author says self driving cars someday wasn much smarter cars smarter road meaning anything can happen postive and negative polarity messages binary code the smart roads systems worked but they required massive upgrade existing roads and things will way too expensive most imporant most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe driverless cars will alot work and don think people would want through the struggle for driverless car reading through the paragraphs really help understand what going the story driverless cars would waste time,2
the article making mona lisa smile the author very well explains how future technology innovation called facial action coding system will able indicate the emotions human being sitting front computer screen say this pretty outrageous but innovative system but here some evidence back that first all the facs facial action coding system able detect the basic emotions human being such happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness the article author nick alto says the computer constructs computer model the face all major muscles the model must move like human muscles meaning that the computer can recognize the movements your facial muscles able determine your emotions examples muscle movements indicate your emotions are like raising your eyebrows that can indicate that you surprised how around your mouth can tighten that can mean you angry the other hand feel like this system being able determine human beings emotions facial expressions may seem little faulty due the fact that there will always more than one person this planet who has the ability hack into the system adult even child and potentially put that person risk danger referring back paragraph feel like this facial action coding system was come into play our daily activities through technology should stay educational public environment such library school even then still feel like need receive some sort permission access this type computer software due the fact seems like some high quality program back claim feel like this software program would actually pretty unique not only test out but really know that the system itself does function properly you can only imagine how chidren are going react seeing that type technology around them even without using the system humans perform the same type impressive calculations everyday for instance you really close with person like you can immediately tell how that person feeling looking their facial expression for example you walk into room and see your friend with their head down and eyebrows lowered you can kind get hint that your friend isn feeling too well the article speaks about how about you look the mirror and make particular facial expression referring basic human emotion you can potentially start feel that emotion like you were just stand front the mirror smiling you would start feeling happy boost your mood little bit overall feel like the facial action coding system pretty unique program helping humans interact more with computers although also feel like there are some major concerns about the software can help understand more and more the technology that humans have around,4
cars should able drive themselves that would help the risk drunk drivers would would allow the pollution down since the car uses half the fuel today taxis also could open more jobs around the car industry cars should able drive themselves for the safety drunk drivers lower pollution ratings and open more jobs the people the car industry drunk drivers are really ruining people lives there own life google succeeds creating this driverless vehicle than that could reduce the chance drunk drivers getting accidente tremendously people would able get there destination safer than they would normally this could help the decrease drunk drivers today our traffic the pollution today air isn nearly bad what can get years cars are one the main source the pollution the air now and can lower that should since the driverless car would use half less the fuel then thats less the pollution people should take consideration that the driverless car would help great amounts with this problem the driverless car will lower the pollution our air many people our country are jobless the driverless car created fully who will tend its needs this allows knowledge spread mechanics assistance with the car would need mandatory its going safe car then needs safe car from the axel the body work people will gain the knowledge help construct the car jobs are important people because they need provide for families themselves with the driverless car people will able have job and maintain the driverless car should created drunk drivers will handled with the pollution the air would lower would also raise the jobs that would needed maintain safety the car cars should able drive themselves for all those reasons stated the safety our people the pollution the air and the jobs the community that all would helped with the driverless car,3
knowing all and changing the world although humans often think themselves omniscient sadly not the case when comes reading emotions human expressions this article making mona lisa smile nick alto the author describes the ability detect humans emotions through new technology called the facial action coding system facs the use this system educational experiences can enhanced globally therefore the use facs read emotional expressions students classroom valuable facs reliable system that can scientifically read human emotions accurately the software developed credible professors thomas huang the beckman insitute for advanced science the university illinois and nicu sebe the university amsterdam system created two college professors promises the credibility the software for professors often are valued unbiased credible source who dedicate themselves into new innovations and such also the complex programming facs adds another layer the reliability for example the software constructs computer model the face all major muscles which must behave and move like human muscles this anatomical system suggests the high accuracy this system for humans tend read emotions soley based the basic features the human face such lips and eyes while the other hand facs able analyse the all the muscles human face and draw conclusion based its calculations therefore this well developed system must valued read students expressions classroom for its accuracy and reliability facs not only able classify the six basic emotions but also identify mixed emotions individual facs relies characteristic movements the facial muscles identify happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness this suggests the software advanced ability read human emotions soley based facial expressions but also the practicality facs the accuracy this software will allow teachers know change and enhance the educational system based how the students react certain methods teaching often teachers are not able read students emotions because they are focused teaching the material however through the use facs this software can distinguish how the students feel without disrupting the class while the teacher can focus teaching the material furthermore facs can identify mixed emotions well for example using this system mona lisa vinci was found percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry this perplex programming suggest its ability recognize human emotions details which can used allow detailed analysis the educational system and transform order make the educational system more practical and enjoyable the same time although the evidences are evident and clear some might bring the concerns regarding fake emotion however facs ability detect fake emotions well for example can detect when zygomatic major pistorius moving and depending the muscle can identify the falseness the human emotions this system can spot truthful not untruthful faces and base such emotions can used alter the educational system into better one therefore the system must valued many doubt about the capability the modern educational system however the use the latest technology called facial action coding system the educational system could altered into something different level terms practicality and helpfulness all around the world this system must valued read emotional expressions students classroom for such reasons and the world might changed this,5
global warming something that very dangerous and something that human should ask for but driving car daily schedule thats basically what your doing car one the main causes air pollution and when humans use many times day doesn make that any better their are many places that notice the increase global warming the country reduces the amount car usage according source vauban families not own cars and passenger cars are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions europe and some car intensive areas the united states the question why isn the united states doing something stop the aumont air pollution our country paris another country thats doing something for this cause another source states after days near record pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city those are not the only two countries that are taking action for this cause columbia they have day called car free and program which the only things allowed are hiking biking skating even busses taxi the gol the program promote alternative transportation and reduce smog but this could have negative impact car companies like ford and much more source provides with some information that states study last year found that driving young people decreased between the years the fellow citizens dont you think its time make the change and act upon limiting the amount usage your car would also save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety next time your driving your car just remember that could hurting the environment,3
driverless cars have been big topic lately some ways driverless cars sound cool but they also seem little scary think that driverless cars shouldn allowed public roads because they are not safe some think being able have your car drive itself sounds nice you could just sit your car and listen music while you wait argive your designation driverless cars would allow you sit your seat hands the wheel but not actually driving this idea does sound nice but all other technology such computers and phones technology not always reliable driverless car could cause marjory even fatal crash while most driverless cars require you have hands the wheel this does not mean you will paying attention something about happen all would take for something the car mess and people could very seriously hurt think that people driverless cars are not safe and they should not allowed public roads,3
snowy days equal blurry camera picture with the support that how could you prove was made aliens you can see when the picture were taken december december the north snow quit often which makes very hard for good picture snow day have you every went outside and looked well its very cloudy then your trying tell that was ancient alien civilization theres way could get clear picture what snowy day between the camera distance from mars and the snowy day the only way you could prove that there aliens their going mars which has never been done the only reason you want this true because nasa would get more meny for the dissertation the first ancient civilization that have found everyday there new story lines ancient civilization saying they have found something like this but the end its just solid rock with life support snowy days equal blurry camera pictures this picture just showing piece rock that was taken the right angle the right time show face its not about the money its about knowing the truth and the truth its just boring rock anyways wouldnt nasa hide from really were aliens,2
nasa viking spacecraft was circling mars taken photos when took photo that favored human head scientist said was common cydonia where the photo was first taken they also said isn easy see cydonia also that when the picture was taken second time was winter and cloudy when the picture was taken third time was clear and you could tell wasn face when the picture was first taken scientist said that was just another martian mesa which was common enough around cydonia this one just had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh scientist took another picture but when that picture was taken was winter time was fairly cloudy the sky you couldn see clearly scientist said wasnt easy target cydonia fact hard work they said that they just don pass over the face that often april cloudless summer day another picture was taken unlike all the other pictures this one had the best camera and was zoomed all the way when the picture was taken that day you could tell that fact wasn face the picture that was taken was very serious thing and was looked for many years people thought was face made aliens show life mars but the pictures were taken you could tell that wasn when the picture was first taken you could tell wasn scientist said that was common for where was also scientist said wasn easy see cydonia where the picture was taken now pople know from all the evidence that isn face,3
the technology valuable for many reasons one the reasons being that the latest innovation being used make second reason because can make characters video games seem more expressive would better for humans that can not talk reading students facial expressions could help see they need help the councilors office using this technology teachers can use see their students are confused lost while doing their work student angry can read their facial expression then the teacher could send them out into the hall the technology could even possibly know when fight about happen between two students reading their facial expressions empathy can happen when using this technology can used see someone lying telling the truth lastly can used conduct classroom student tired the teacher would know wake them,2
viking face mars real fake the face mars claimed lots people real the people say might landaulet ancient artifacts aliens created arguments like this there are other sides every story then theres great sum people who think its fake that they faked get attention get the community this fact because they might working something else one looks into they first found out about this called face spacecraft for nasa was circling the planet taking photo when spacecraft spotted the shadowy likeliness face some sort the face looked like was looking back the camerawoman the region the planet called cydonia the face was also nearly miles long from end end but everyone opinion different opinion that its natural landform the planet because why would some aliens make such thing like that just leave the ground that planet think was just asteroid hitting the planet and flying some the debre pile that looks like face certain type year the shadows over the pile planet chunks make look like human face also when that photo was taken the camera back then were very pixellated not high definition where you can see the detail the camera were getting little better you see the article about this face mars looks like the called face deforming because has been there for years since the last high definition picture the picture shows that the face looks cracked maybe because back then the camera were not good you couldnt see the detail but now the cameras start having greater detail that why couldnt see the cracks the other pictures the world may never know until someone goes mars investigate,2
when the author talks about venus talks about how and what like and how works venus different from earth but the same some way different because the temperature and the atmosphere and the surface the temperature reaches degrees fahrenheit and that survivable for humans the surface bad hot lava and molten like surface and can melt most metals venues atmosphere mainly filled with percent carbon dioxide the air pressure really bad strong enough could crush submarine like its going down the deepest part our oceans nasa trying come with way study venus with blimp like vehicle that can float miles away from venus and its nasty surface and atmosphere even though the temperature will reach only degrees fahrenheit still survivable for humans,1
the face mars could not made aliens because the face cydonia change over time its rock transformation and there woud have been more things prove life mars the thinking that aliens bit over bord the face the red planet cydonia changed over time there was life cydonia the face wouldnt have changed like did looked like shadow face had white tent had racks like rock the face would had stayed the same there was living life another reason looks more like transforming rock people tend already had picture what somethin there head when the people that took the picture saw this thought looked like face when you tell poeple what something looks like they wont fight you because there head they seen the rock just time changing thing dosen even look like fae that they try and make you see earth have thing prove that live here the red planet they only found this one thing there was life there would more things prove and sooner years years there has been only one face found ish years the same face was there but was different years has pasted anf there has only been one thing the shows that there could life the red planet now under stand that does look like human face yes and different people have went there just take picture but there was life this planet dont you think would have shown itself little bit more and not hide for years giving one piece evidence that its real there was live plante cydonia would had been more things prove also the face didn stay the same another reason rock more believable then aliens just something think about they did think there was life different planet but earth dont you think they would tell people and not try and hide for long they can they would want the world know more about,3

autonomous cars are the cars the future they will able drive themselves without any human interaction needed autonomous cars would far more intelligent than any human driver preventing numerous crashes that are due driver distraction autonomous cars will forever change the way people commute autonomous cars would change the way people commute and from work they would also change the way people travel with human needed the wheel autonomous cars can make traveling long distances lot more enjoyable would also allow the human occupants others things rather than just sit and look out the window autonomous cars are also lot smarter than the average human driver this comes from the fleet sensors that are stored board these sensors include cameras gps inertial motion sensors automotive radar and the most important all lidar lidar uses laser beams map the area around the car this generates and degree model what happening around the car the article driverless cars are coming the author points out many good attributes the autonomous car the author claims that autonomous cars would use one half the fuel used the taxis today less fuel used could mean less toxic emmissions and cleaner environment the author also states that the autonomous car would have more flexibility than bus today bus runs along predetermined route public transportation system that used autonomous cars would far better for those peple who not want stay along that predetermined route autonomous cars will also lot safer the article reports that google fleet autonomous cars have driven more than half million miles and have not had accident the autonomous car would lot safer for the people riding inside but also for the people around autonomous cars are able see everything that going its sphere influence this something human driver could not because not have degree range vision the autonomous car driving its way into our everyday lives its will make the world safer and cleaner place live the autonomous car will change the way people commute forever,3
think the face mars natural landform because anything can form land and there coincidence that that land formation can look familiar something earth like human face the face mars was photographed arent really seeing what the face mars looks exactly like but are seeing alot though the image the face the best viking photo proves show that because the photo image span meters there were ships planes even small shacks you would able spot them out the photo what the viking photo really shows the martian equivalent butte mesa which are both found commonly the american west therefore mars has many land formations all shapes and sizes the face that all know and are curious about could just another mars natural landforms,2
making mona lisa smile the author describes new way technology could identify human emotions this new technology called the facial action coding system can tell what emotions people have scanning their faces this article states that this could applied classrooms not think this good idea the sense that they are spying kids and adjusting how they feel one the main reasons not think this good idea because would not make any sense you would spend bunch money something that would not really help kids out that much have programs for kids like that who are slower learning than others when says that kids are going get bored and will change the lesson but does not know that kids are going get bored school matter what think that would wrong have this classrooms because they would effective think that would effective because they would not care about the first place they would wait for something they know and could use their advantage some kids would wait for change they not know the answer not know the lesson they would able get done one thing that this could used for help out countries figure out what other nation leaders and enemies are thinking how they are feeling nice program but think will not work for school applications think would get the way kids learning the system actually pretty cool but not think that should used education,3
driverless cars what big leap technology position driverless cars that think that its very good idea able drive our own still even though the car has acess able drive own would make people feel safe able prevent accident there was multifunction how ever the way technology improving truly fascinating but there will people out there that would like drive their own and able take breaks often but like said the previous paragraph they would feel more safe they where able control their own well wanting take breaks here and there within years sensors have become more advanced detect ands respond danger out control skids rollovers the sensors can apply breakers individual wheels and reduce power from engine allowing far better response and control than human drive ever could quoted google cofounder sergey there could serious functions cant predict that cant happen think would safer had the ability choose drive not but way this could really help out the future say that driver not paying attention the road and they are about hit deer sensor could very well come handy keeping anyone the car safe and also can prevent damage the car other wods this could either way could good but also have some concerns conclusion belive that keep working the technology could very well have success driverless cars but untill then think should really think out the pros and cons this situation before advance the next step this could very well and amazing break through but also could lead some complications other words belive that should have twe choice drive and able have this advantage able have this easy safe thing,4
there has been many stories about aliens but are they real imagine seeing something like unmasking face mars would you think was alien natural landform well you can see the scientist figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh according the nasa few days later unveiled the image for all see huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving illusion eyes nose and mouth said paragraphs and although few scientists believed the face was alien artifact could alien face but when usually see aliens sure there maybe other creatures out there but paragraph says when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photo thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all conclusion would all want belive that aliens are real and that the face mars was alien but wasnt the other side have discovered amazing face mars the nasa and michael malin have proven the picture not alien you can see from all the prof found,3
driverless cars seem cool you driverless cars are thing the future but really know how much work money and time will take create driverless cars firmly beleive that having driverless cars our society would super cool but not believe should create these cars driverless cars would require changing the laws and there would many complications someone got injured due driverless car the money and time would have put towards driverless cars simply not worth paragraph states the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer this question from the passage shows that there would many questions something was happen and whose fault was there was not person driving the vehicle have never had completely driverless cars before why should get them now drivers are doing fine now but who say they won fall asleep get distracted their car driving itself paragraph says wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive drivers would get bored and then what does that mean usually accident tesla projecting release for car capable driving autopilot percent the time people can barely afford new car right now let alone driverless car driverless cars will too expensive too timely and there will too many complications the money and time would have put towards driverless cars simply not worth most states now illegal even test computer driven cars that the case then would amazing see all states make legal for completely driverless cars the road computer driven cars are controlled from computer and can controlled something was happen the same way driverless cars will also able controlled but there will human present the future does hold driverless cars there will lot money going into those cars and even more money out your pocket you decide buy one will see what the future holds for these cars,4
first this technology not valuable why you may ask well its because technology trying take away what humans are use for example that when first school teacher greets why would student parents want greeted electronic next you can really trust electronics because they can malfunction even catch some sort virus meaning that can haywire and mess everything also another example that this technology called facial action coding system will have the right record take photo you don think parents will not allow this technology record snap pictures there kids this article states huang and his colleague are experts developing better way for humans and computers communicate for don want able communicate with electronic unless the phone with someone like right now they just launch out the new iphone where you can unlock with your face was will not buy because many things can wrong conclusion this technology not needed don want and probably won the only one think this,3
have you seen venus the sky while your star gazing although venus often refered earth twin challenging explore venus one the more challenging planets explore for couple reasons those reasons are the caron monoxide sulfuric asid andan the severe temperatures venus covered with thick blanket carbon monoxide this one the reasons that makes very dangerous there based the article the challenge exploring venus venus has thick atmosphere almost percent carbon monoxide this mutch carbon monoxide very dangerous the even more challenging part the sulfuric acid the clouds venus are filled with sulfuric acid not only that dangerous but the sulfuric acid highly corrosive highly corrosion almost like saying flammable and the sulfuric acid wasnt dangerous hot but the temperature alone enough kill you here earth experience heat but venus the heat extreme the article states the planets surface temperatures average over degrees farenheit you were wanting try making good luck but based the information seems like not recommended stay home earth enjoy the fresh air and life that awaits you dangerous waste your time,3
can you imagine sleeping your car while your car drives you work this certainly becoming more and more possible technology advances all for the devlopment self driving cars advance humans everything around advancing new and better phones smart house systems its alot safer than human with temptation speed there will less car accidents this technology also will help people under the influence getting home driver less cars are the future road safety the article states that they have very high tech sensors and makes the car super smart gives the car human like senses this technology ever fails then the car can still driven human has backup also the ability perform other actions while the car drives you there will many less car accidents related texting and driving can also give the ability catch show your drive work even get some extra sleep the possiblities are endless overall self driving cars are smart revolutionary act towards cars the possiblities are endless hopefully the future can have car that will completely drive itself the future bright,3

imagine you looking the sky and you see star thats brighter than most then you might seeing the planet venus which one the brightest points the sky which where gets nickname evening star the author from the text talks about this and more support his claims used percentage degrees future plans real situations and real events paragraphs and shows him using percentages and degrees support some his claim the text states thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus one the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric presure times greater than what experience our own planet the text also states thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth with this text evidence shows how using his evidence show how much venus different from the earth and why their life the planet the author talk about how venus and mars are our planet neighbor and how have tried land venus but sucess the author states humans have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world each previous mission was unmanned and for goos reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the author also states venus was the hottest surface temperature any planet out solar system even though mercury closer our sun this shows that the author providing real evidence prove his study could dangerous cause how the past turned out but worth looking into the future with what has failed the past can learn from that and move stronger with better chance succeeding the passage says nasa working other approaches study venus nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray also says our teves earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation this evidence given does show could grow from the past and better the future with each new attempt conclusion with all these details given the author has supported himself with the evidence and some ideas given the passage has proven himself the text with facts and past events the uther did support his claims like using percentages degrees real events real situations and future plans,4
studying the planet venus worth studying but its worth despite the dangers because venus second closes planet earth people often called venus earth twin because there terms size scientists believe that planet venus probably covered with large about oceans and could support any form life another reason why should differ that paragraph talks about how that venus have some features like for example venus has surface rocky sediment has valleys mountains and craters the planet venus can our somewhat our nearest option for planetary vist the reason that its hard for scientists study venus that spacecraft could survivor landing forme then few hours another reason why its difficult land paragraph says the plants surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric over times grether than what experience our won planet this gives example how dangerous and hard could study venous nasa had idea for sending humans study venus and that idea creating possible solution the thistle conditions the surface venus that would allow people float above the fray finally believe that studying the planet venus worth studding for but its worth despite the danger because can probably differ life any lifting thing venus passably find some recourses that venus have that could help change thing,3
driverless cars are another one the world technological marvels that not only take away the prevalent nuisance driving for long periods time but terms safety and efficiency prevail when flexibility increases prices decrease and the safety consumers protected then there reason that semi autonomous cars should not replace the commercial vehicles that see today one the key issues that consumers have today terms purchasing vehicle the fuel consumption sergey brin the cofounder google provides evidence that suggests that these vehicles would use around half the fuel that the vehicles today consume not only that but brin continues state that the flexibility increased well surpassing that bus safety also increased result these vehicles the fact that these vehicles are semi autonomous and not completely autonomous enables human driver take control whenever they deem necessary for example google semi autonomous creations are not truly driverless they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways and when other complicated traffic issues arise sensors are what enable these vehicles perform the tasks that astonish many this day due the fact that sensors have been used since the vast improvements and tests have been conducted over the years ensure that the safety the consumer and those around she are preserved the article even states that within years those sensors from the had become more advanced detect and respond the danger out control skids rollovers these vehicles allow for the potential decrease drunk driving which further emphasizes that safety not only preserved with semi autonomous cars but heavily increased there common misconception that implementing the production these vehicles drivers will get bored waiting for their turn drive although this issue that many psychologists are considering some manufacturers are working eliminate this issue for example the article suggests that there are few car manufacturers that are hoping rid this anxiety bringing car displays and information systems that use heads displays not only source entertainment but also additional safety feature which also major concern that alleviated with semi autonomous cars the fact that many automobile companies such tesla bmw nissan mercedes benz and audi are striving integrate the idea semi autonomous vehicles into their production vehicles provides even further assurance that the benefits undoubtedly outweigh the harms furthermore this article explicitly states that nation based progression and safety semi autonomous vehicles are the means achieving the road truly autonomous car and road dramatic increase safety,4
various forms life just like earth today venus has some similiar stuff like earth has valleys mountains and craters and scientist think that venus was cover all water like how earth was million years ago venus solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survival for humans nasa also doing still doing stdenis today and sending people over there study the planet see the conditons are getting any better worst they can studie and any maybe someday the human beignets can live there another decade once they say the venus safe place visit and live there when you land venus its dangerous people are creating ways that there making ship that will hovering saufley around ground conditions that can not stad the dense the ground the atmosphere and rendering photography and videography and the most important they cant get smales rock gas anything else that case scientist are seeking conduct missions venus,1
the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit inspite the dangers presents telling why need know how affects and how will this something that has been well thought out nasa and they always know what why and how they are doing something the author uses insite from nasa support his idea doing this the author has shown the importance venus first the author gives reasons why need know this the author says often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance paragraph this means venus that closely connected and similar earth then can learn and adapt they continue find new discoveries order keep our civilization tacked and surviving second they explain how affects our ordinary way living they answer the question dangerous why study more they found that could have been another earth once know this because the text says astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system the planet surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters paragraph this means that studying matter condition can learn about and why venus the condition maybe even prevent for earth lastly the author supports their idea telling how are going uncover more information without loosing more they explain that nasa has theory that sending anything electronic will die off within hours where sending parts from the won know this becaue the text states that nasa studying other approaches studying venus for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have leste about three weeks these devices were first envisioned the and played important role the during the war but these devices made calculations using gears and levers without electricity comparison systems that use mechanical pats can made more resistant pressure heat and other forces paragraph this means that hypothetically nasa could send older tech and find way uncover more information therefore the author supports his idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents giving multiple reasons why need the knowlege how affects and how will accomplish that first telling that venus like our twin planet and learning what happened could adapt secondly showing that are can prevent our own downfall lastly the author tells how nasa expects pull this off,4

would nice have driverless cars our world however there are multiple things that could wrong their sensors could make mistakes other technology the car could fail and all these leading accident that could cause injury the driver one example the sensors the car sensor could not working well and sense something else that not intended sense the sensors don alert the driver the car could crash causing the driver injury also the sensors that are used for the braking the car could not work this would result the car not stopping and crashing basically these cars pretty much rely sensors something were wrong the sensors the car wouldn able function well another technology the car could fail not just the sensors the wheels can and example the wheels turn left and right depending what the sensors say the wheel could not turn well because didn read what the sensor said could cause accident not just the wheel that could fail the spinning sensor the roof can also fail according the article this piece technology uses laser beams form model the car surroundings this sensor could fail several ways one the several ways that could not sense object meaning would not know was there this case the car would keep driving itself and end crashing summarize any piece technology were fail would most likely result accident and course causing injury the driver driverless cars would nice yet again having cars that require drivers just fine,3

space has always been considered the final frontier for humanity and humans can only dream what out the cosmos awaiting greeted and our goals exploration that why the exploration venus important despite any and all dangers there are with doing venus could our stepping stone into new era exploration pushing humanity into another golden era renaissance the first reason that will explained why should explore venus despite its hostile environment and dangerous aspects that tells more about the planet itself and gives insight dealing with more challenging and dangerous scenarios the future knowing how planet works will always beneficial and help future space exploration especially when the planet our planetary neighbor the solar system and may have once held attributes similar earth long ago the similarities between the two planets pushes for exploration earth may one day end becoming like venus and require call for innovations accomodate humans onto the planet this speculation the similarities also points the question whether not there was once still water venus this because there really has even been any form water venus then that next points the question about life venus venus similarities earth don stop however venus least now similar earth with its surface rocky sediments valleys mountains and craters the rocky planet formations and such have been found similar those found very commonly earth emphasizing the theory that venus may have once been similar earth and can helped restored this were possible then would make venus second hospitable planet for humans within the solar system making transportation easier than other planets one the closest planets earth but cheaper would require less resources the end venus should still least explored more thoroughly its surface and perhaps later underneath into the deeper undergrounds below the technology ever becomes available this allows for potentially useful information gathered the planet,4
sometimes there are authors that don ever support there facts voght but this author did great job supporting thier essay this author put lease ones fact detail each paragraph keet tell readers that venus can very dangerous also that venus like second sun the solar system venus supper hot that time hotter than earth venus over than degrees fahrenheit even you vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape the still has tempur around degrees fahrenheit have give the author score would give him because did good explain venus aslo gave facts different sorcerous also gave good example did good describing that can even panitz self picture head was doing essay about venus would highly use this article,2
begin feel like the facial action coding system would start big argument should used not most people are going question the the software for example what student didn want everyone know thier emotions also isn that kind invocation privacy but can see the positive side the new software first all the new software facial action coding system has lot positive sides about paragraph six says classroom computer recognizes when student becoming confused bored this will modify the lesson the computer reads that the student confused bored also the new system reads student emotions this could stop lot school shootings furthermore the new software doesn recognize the student person could send alert the office and other classroom the could lock their doors hide secondly there are some negatives about the system for example paragraph six says most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication this shows that the computer needs understand that too also isn the new software kind invading your privacy because what you don want anyone know your emotions this really going help students learn lose human emotions all all personally think the new software should used only schools for the students teachers and staffs around the world this system can recognize students and teachers then doing the attendance should quick this new software could save students lives and stop school shooting you want your childrens lives safer school than dead zone kids,3
the author the article the challenge exploring venus suggests that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents paragraph the author states while venus simple see from the distant but safe vantage point earth has proved very challenging place examine more closely this sentence shows the author belief that venus quite challenging planet explore when close far the author has given his opening formed one his main ideas paragraph the author gives background information how venus the closest planet earth terms size yet every previous spaceship sent venus did not survive the landing the author doing very good job the beginning the article establish his main idea and giving relevant background information support his idea paragraph the author continues label the reasons which venus dangerous planet land giving the information that its composed nearly carbon dioxide and its ground temperatures average degrees fahrenheit far the author doing very thorough job describing the dangers venus yet has not made argument that explains why worthy pursuit despite its dangers paragraph the author starts uncover some nasa ideas how further exploration venus would possible one those ideas include hot air ballon style exploration craft that will allow scientists hover around miles off the planet surface the author goes say that this solution will certainly not make the conditions venus easy handle yet they will make them survivable the same paragraph the author also explains the importance exploration venus goes say that venus eof the closest planets our solar system earth this means that venus may have one point sustained life just like the planet earth this turn gives appealing reason which exploration venus should defiantly considered paragraphs and the author somewhat refutes his prior information from paragraph the author does this saying that although the blimp will keep scientists survivable condition will not aid them collection surface samples allow them take pictures the ground due the overlaying carbon dioxide blocking the view the planet the author then goes explain that scientists have found new solution this problem they decided that moren robots are too weak explore the planet venus due the amount technology inside them one wire comes undone then the whole robot unusable order combat this the author states that scientists are planning using mechanical computers due their low use actual technology the author very effectively refutes the opposing claim the idea the blimp and then gives example that shows how that original idea can improved overall the author correctly supports his ideas and claims with background information and properly demonstrates how venus worthy pursuit exploration despite the dangers presents,5
the ability able read students emotions can helpful and cool but can also redundant the ability being able see what emotions others something that occurs almost naturally but being able tell exactly how someone feels about something can help people such psychologists teachers extremly being able see what students think about lesson about video they are watching school can quite helpful teacher some type educate able recieve information about how someone feels could help the teacher see the student actually enjoys the lesson least interested the ability being able tell how student thinking could change the way how figuring out emotional information about the student and help the teachers improve their work and teachings but this technology could creepy for some users the ability know person likes add off website also means that their face being displayed for someone something see lot people won like that idea not like the ability doing right normal the ability being able see how people are thinking with technology may help some situations but the human mind already programed tell these certain characteristics about other people the use using technology help could quite redundant teachers are able tell student isn enjoying lesson the student either sleeping yawning looking bored the use technology show human emotions can help some ways for people but not worth using technology for,2

think that should keep the electoral college because changing election popular vote for the president the united states can bad can bad because majority the people pick president and not good president and they are just picking him pick him then might not good president might just popular aka well known should keep the electoral college because fair and going all the votes not just the popular votes the electoral college consists electors majority electoral votes required elect the president which means non democratic method when you vote for presidential candidate you actually voting for slate electors the electoral college has better chance having outcome than the popular votes election for example obama recieved percent the electoral vote compared only percent the popular votes cast for him and romney which means the electoral college much more trustworthy system than the popular vote electoral college has something called swing states swing states are states that often pay close attention the campaign and they really listen the competing campaign they are the most thoughtful voters and the most thoughtful ones should the ones decide everything the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states that incorrect because the electoral college pays close attention every state see which ones would good pick the popular states says that the electoral college system out date and lame the electoral college avoids run off elections unlike the popular vote system ending claim saying should keep the electoral college because more organized system,3

driverless cars once yesterday dream slowly becoming reality driverless cars are the horizon there certainly good reason excited but these unpiloted vehicles are still good while off they are live the first word their name driverless driverless cars should only used the car itself can handle the vast majority the problems would face the road truly driverless cars are driverless not requiring driver all today driverless cars can only perform under few conditions one being able handle driving functions speeds miles per hour certainly not ideal today society they need notify the driver when the road requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents driverless cars should only used the car can handle above the driving functions getting the driver attention constantly would very annoying the driver who bought the car they wouldn have any driving the first place some situations are understandable sure most drivers would agree but would not want driverless car can drive itself the people interested these types cars would want entertainment they don have just stare out the windshield the whole ride entertainment options should available while not sacrificing safety added bonus appealing larger market would have the option turn off the artificial driving and control the car yourself not only could deadly something went wrong but totally relying the car doing the driving for you after some time would ensure that your driving skills are low thus even more danger the car malfunctions traffic laws currently are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times those laws will change driverless cars can prove themselves handle situations the road safely the issue liability should let laws put place before the cars are released the general public that way there question who falt someone driverless car hits driver controlled car one with option being driverless vice versa conclusion driverless cars should only released they meet the safety standards necessary meet government regulations while providing the consumer with entertainment that can easily turned off the car there rare situation the car can not meet these cars are the cars the future why not make them the best that they can,4

the article driverless cars are coming the author presents first the positive then presents the features that are designed the negative the positive outweigh the positive sence accomplishment people take more into acount what they could accomplice instead having physically driving their car and not think about what bad idea such thing would imply the author first state the year the design was made then gave readers the automatic function the car and finally gave the detail features that would not allow the driver just completely separate from the car the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but spacial touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel paragraph proponent for completely driverless cars would state only the positive while leaving out that the car for example were malfunction then there would drivers steer back control and the lives the civilians would put danger most level headed peope however are ponens such idea completely driverless car most people would not willingly put their lives the handle machine not directed human hand people shoud wary such unassisted technology throughout the article the author persistently bombarde readers with the more positive laroche having driverless car then following how the manufacturers are trying protect human lives not allowing the car completely driverless most people should take into account what they for before buying the options bias source not luddite but human beings should control their own lives and not let piece machinery handle for them they should cautious the dangers having unassisted machines even the government said was safe that when something does wrong they can not blame anything another,3
driverless cars are coming through the passage has stated that companies are working building cars that drive themselves feel that this idea driverless cars are somewhat pleasing google created cars that drove more than million miles with crashing some people can even drive the store without crashing almost being one the idea driverless cars appealing reasonings for this because now day people are way distracted while driving and are less careful through the advancements technology adults and teens spend lot more time looking their phones than the roads most accidents these days are caused from people being unaware what their surrounding areas while driving father has always told that when driving down just looking from you keep your eyes your surroundings because are reckless behind the wheel this generation what father told true today you were driving you wouldn supersized see someone either talking their phone texting because people are reckless and feel that since they vehicle they will safe that something was happen that could indistinctly grab control the wheel and avoid the collision another feel that driverless are good thing because the weather the state that live the weather could sunny and warm for one day then you look the news for follow weather report and within two days cloudy with eighty percent chance snow weather conditions can get very bad and hard manuever car that has been designed detect the danger out control skids and rollovers would huge safety advantage also with the upgrade sensors cars would able ally brakes individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone the passage states that some people questioned why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive what observed through the years people what new advancements especially vehicles the past before turning signals drivers would put their arms outside the windows not long ago drivers weren sure how get somewhere they used map now all they have tell their siri the car where they what and siri looks and puts the directions into the gps the main idea what saying people strive for change especially change that makes their live easier when driverless cars are actually the roads everyone will get used justy like how when cars were first invented people had get used tpo driving,3
these days the generation that live man has came with many ways use technology have motion censored lights cameras game systems and now even cars former google cofounder sergey brin and google have made cars that can actually drive they own these cars can drive themselves more than half million miles without crash but they still need assistance from driver once while when comes things they can such reversing dealing with accidents traffic issues point view this sounds really cool wont lie another thing all have see the bigger picture let explain myself the good way seeing driverless cars would good affect for many reasons one wouldnt have worry about reckless drivers when the cars would programed know speed limits and everything human suppose know about driving there would less injuries deaths losses money for repairs and much more also wouldn have take driver tests and have licences could get where need throes are the positive ways look the driverless cars idea now lets look how this idea would effect negative way all know sometimes technology can have errors such glitches viruses mistrusted then could damage all the way see technology very sensitive view and sometimes even dangerous imagine yourself one these cars and say starts act either your gon na left stranded where you are you could possibly injured depending what the car does all know technology can have mind its own also when accident happens who ever the driver seat responsible for the passangers and pedestrians and something does happen are you gon na blame the car like said the idea really cool wont lie people thoe have make the right depictions what choose weigh the facts and reasons and see your pint view thank your for your time,3
the works car have created wonders people early the early now people need understand the advantages limiting car use pollution has gone down cities from not using cars and people have reported less stress which due the car rates going down many people have argued that jobs are going more down then may need stop using cars but there always way fix small situations such that studies have shown cars have created pollution for the environment pollution can cause sickness and other affects that can cause habitat inhabitable passenger cars are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions europe and some car intensive areas the united states rosenthal though can fix that many cities such paris france have experimented with the law involving cars see the country can have pollution decrease and they did within the first day duffer reported that monday paris created ban for the even numbered plates and the smog was able clear one day time the smog cleared enough monay for the ruling french party rescind the ban for odd numbered plates tuesday duffer people have argued that stopping car production may cause people lose their jobs there way fix that selsky reported that bogota colombia because the car distribution slowing down they were able make parks and sport centers accessible parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city selsky with that being said without people running any those facilities then parks and sport centers wouldn that accessible the fellow citizens creating more places like parks and sport centers and less places like car factories would able limit car usage without the worry someone losing their job and not being able get one cars have also been known cause stress the article german suburb life goes without cars rosenthal quoted heidrun walter talking about how tense she was when she had car the constant worrying for gas and car bills may factor towards the stress someone life young adults have not worried much for car making the somewhat more content mine and have not bothered get driver license even though they both live places where one could come handy rosenthal limiting car use can cause major impact today society demographic shifts driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate rosenthal has many advantages that people should understand pollution rates can down stress could down once you start limiting car use,4
state senator the electoral college outdated and commonly viewed anachronism this system voters instead voting for president vote for slate electors the slate electors chosen for the statewide election would congress congress they would then vote for the president for many people seems understandably unfair first off voters can not control who their electors vote for this point time voters have more say which president elected they can only hope that the elected candidate shares the same views they most the times this the wrong case second off many times voters will get confused who they voting for they pick out candidate without knowing much information about them what their views are random candidate will chosen for their vote and most times this tends come unhappy ending many times voters will disappointed and frustrated with how the election turns out people claim this tends due the electoral college would terms much simpler change the election popular vote this would have many benefits the difficulty the systems selecting president how people react choosing popular vote time the election would cut slimmer people wouldn have focus choosing elector their worries that their state electors didn share their views would give our people the chance vote for the president they want the end the electoral college should abolished and thrown out doesn make sense keep continuing this way when the votes should the people not random electors,4

driverless cars are not smart idea the car could have some type technical difficulty and could stop working correctly and cause accident the cars have many items them make work they could cost lot money and many people would not able afford them would waste products produce them people still have pay attention the road and sometimes had drive the car then there point these cars would like driving normal car most places dont let people computer testing cars cars became totally driverless most places the world would not allow the cars driven there the cars could have technical issues the road and cause accident some the sensors stopped working while driving one would until something happens pedestrian gets hurt driverless cars are not safe ideas there are many things that could wrong while using one the cost one could much they would only cause more trouble and accidents the road many places would not allow them,2
aliens this realistic argument the surface mars there something particular something that looks like face nasa decided that this would good way get peoples attention now are faced with the argument could have been aliens spotted the viking the particular face does fact crosley simula face the possibility there being levins very unrealistic the face could have just been another butte mesa the face could have just been coincidence but how could know really can nasa could just saying this get attention but mabey not even there was allein landform mars will not able know for sure like any history only know through drawings writing and the only evidence have this face hopefully there will more find near future mabey even drawings will appear that can interdict not then all nasa still has evidence that there could conclusion mars will probably not hold anything else like this the picture may look like face but its more like mesa butte will there mysterious things like this again proving that was not coincidence mabey nasa will find other things different planets mabey not,2
after reading the article unmasked the face mars believe that these are just natural formed landforms one reason because this face has many similar characteristics landforms found the west secondly because the the picture only show natural land form after all lastly becuase because have offical proof that this was once alien civilization one reason believe that this simply natural landform because the many similarities has with many the landforms the west paragraph states that what the picture actually show the martian equivalent butte mesa land forms common haroun the american west also states the same paragraph that thats lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars another reason that this text has caused belive that all the face natural landform because when many people observed tha photo many belived that was natural landform after all paragraph thousands anxious web surfers were waiting for when the image first appeared plebe sie revealing natural planform there was significance alien monument after all also earlier the article paragraph state that scientists figured was another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusal shadows that made look like egyptian pharoah the third and finale reason why believe that this just natural land form beause nasa has simply proof that this could possibly that there could have been once alien civilization one mars cydonia paragraph scientists figured out that was only common martian mesa was only the unusal shadow make look like egyptian pharoah also paragraphs though states that the weather was clear and all they had found was that they had significance proof alien civilization mars only have simula characteristics natural landforms quiet like the ones earth the other hand maybe its not natural landform maybe some people may right could some type alien landform nasa could have done something the pictures mess with the hopefuls paragraph states that the camera board the mgs had peer through the whisp could see that face perhaps siad skeptics alien markings were hidden haze but this has relevance because there clear weather second attempt getting photo they figured out was just natural landform becuase the fact that this photo clearly picked that had many the same characteristics natural landforms the american west this proves even though that that could have been civilization shows that was only landform conclusion all the face mars natural landform because they didnt have any proof that this was alien civilization had many the same characteristics many natural landforms the american west and that much the research they had still proved that was natural landform because there findings,5
senator believe the electoral college should consider changed congress because the many people this great country wouldnt trust electors for voting think every single confirmed vote should counted and registered because that the true meaning voting for something someone out the elector would lie not think one them had favorite been bribed rigged elections think its hard trust bunch men and women who majority the states nothing about also think swing states should considered like every other state there instead calling them toss states that anyone could over take even the text says who are the electors they can someone not holding public state office who picks them and cant even vote who the electors should the system disaster self why are taking million public citizen votes and only letting one man women turn its non democratic and has real use this off completely disagree and not feel that the electoral college needed seems like waste our money and puts debt paying these people tons cash vote something simple voting now there only one thing believe right the voting system that big state size and population does deserve the bigger amount electoral votes then smaller states like florida new york california texas and many other states since the population dense changing the voting system popular vote think makes people feel more involved whats actually happening instead just one measly vote people complain about other people who dont vote well thats one the reasons why person out million population state one would care cause then those right the electoral college then thats what actually matters the end the day people could careless who ran the nation but the end the night anyone who knows about the electoral college wants changed,3
the idea studding venus has always driven humans curiosity well wanting explore venus easier said then done venus exploration very tricky but very meaningful nasa nasa has discovered the venus has earth like feathers such valleys mountains and craters but very hard get much infomation due the blanket carbon dioxide venus also singel spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades meaning that time explore again researched shows that venus was once venus was once covered largely with oceans and with that information venus could have supported wild life nasa now working better drone explore venus the ones before were very delicate and couldnt surpass the heat pressure and force that venus provided with these alterations nasa will able collect way more information our sister planet despite the danger and money humans schuld explore venus and other planets the solar system gain more information,2
venus the evening star gorgeous planet look the night sky but deadly planet step foot scientists and astronomers are finding various ways either put human the planet send another spacecraft over sit the air longer than couple hours like the past ones that were sent first venus has lot flaws and conditions where humans wouldn able outstanding the text states the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit the challenge exploring venus human would able outstanding that burning temperature without some type aircraft special suit also the text states and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the challenge exploring venus you would just crush you were placed this planet these condition are way more extreme than anything humans have encountered second even though scientists and astronomers know how dangerous venus and how terrible their conditions are they are fascinated and want learn way more about they believe venus the most earth like planet our solar system the text states long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the challenge exploring venus this would good reason explore and find out more things that used this planet the text also states the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters the challenge exploring venus after reading all this can show that venus can our only closest option for planetary visit the furre conclusion there are lot pros and cons sending human spacecraft the planet venus the planet venus deadly and someone steps the planet without the proper grear spacecraft will lead tragic but obvious death but soon curiosity will lead humans the planet evaluate and study the planet venus,4

think that driverless cars have the potential significantly safer use than manually driven cars many people get sucked their phones when they should watching the road don feel comfortable control car are just bad drivers driverless cars can lift the responsibility all the passengers safety off the driver shoulders they can save thousands lives google driverless cars have driven more than half million miles without crash even though theirs require partial manual control this good sign the safety driverless cars yes people may still need learn how drive but they would need drive less with one these cars the less person drives the less chances there are accident their part sensors cars have been around since the and have become advanced enough detect and respond dangers such out control skids rollovers they can make the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine this much more control than human driver could manage alone driverless cars have the capacity possess many more safety features than manually driven cars since driverless car would not controlled person would not make the same mistakes the road that person would make even partially automatic car could activate safety features stop itself from going out control driverless cars have proven themselves safe far and are likely even more safe the future that why think need driverless cars,3
the face mars wasn created aliens fact has connection alien life form all when the face was first discovered one had really known much about people started hopping conclusions before anything could proven tested that until nasa started looking into this face mars the face actually huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth that simply rock formation but the shadows casted upon the crevices gives the strange formation the appeal human face when people began become even more skeptical april nasa had the mars global surveyor draw close enough snap another picture the face the day was cloudless summer day cydonia nasa surveyor camera had taken crisp photo the face highest resolution each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel you can discern things digital images three times better than the pixel size nasa and the rest the world had more clear and better picture the face everyone was talking about although the face may seem strange could rather common landform for cydonia what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte landforms common around the american west although this one may seem stick out from the rest could merely the shadows playing tricks the human mind scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh the landform may very well common around mars merely the shadows ghosting around the landform that causes look like face reality there alien life form connected this rock formation all,3
the article called the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the danger presents because the author suggest nasa study beauce the author calming that venus just like earth long time ago the author supporting his claim using geographic regions such rocky surface the planet venus valleys mouths and craters paragraph the author says taht more importantly researchers can not tate samples rock gas anything else from distance therefore scientist seeking conduct thorough mission understand venus would need get close and personal despite the risk from all this can realy see that the author interested studying venus but too risky for human inside venus atmosphere because almost carbon dioxide conclusion the author trying persuading nasa study venus the author doing this later the other people will try study venus the author claming that venus similar earth the author want more peole interest nasa study venus,2
the challenge exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the author supports this claim very well showing how survivable venus could firstly the author states solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels this shows that would have healthier and more energy were live venus and living venus the main reason explore this piece evidence also shows although radiation wouldn any better venus also wouldn any worse which could tremendously amazing thing secondly the author states long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans that could have supported various forms life just like earth although this evidence speaks the past tense this still shows how little know about venus and how much could know were explore better even though intensely dangerous beyond worth were attempt start life our twin planet lastly the author states venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters this shows how well the planet the present well how good idea would find out more about conclusion there still much left undiscovered venus and the author layed out many good reasons why should still continue trying explore besides history never would have been made all time one ever took few risks here and there,3
although may seem that there face mars there isn there have been conspiracy theories that the face mars part the remains alien but that not true there are many good reasons why the object that looks like face isn face after studying the face mars have many theories what may actually chief scientist the nasa mars exploration program jim gervin thinks that the face actually butte butte naturally made landform usually found around the american west like the snake river plain idaho there butte called middle butte very well looks like what see mars called the face there are many other theories what the for may know that many people have been saying that the rock formation mars face but isn there are real reasons how that formation could alien head the alien head does look lot like one but you look the picture looks nothing like one that gives away that the face was just complete luck for look like that magazines they have been saying that the face was real but can you always trust magazines magazines will lie sometimes that they get story that people will want read you can really determine that the face actually face conclusion the face not face although may have seemed like face lot people wasn later this will time laugh because some people actually thought that the rock formation was face,3
the article the challange exploring venus the author strongly supports his claim that humans should explore and study venus despite its many dangers using strong deviance and logic studying the planet may dangerous but the author gives fair amount examples showing why important solve the mysteries venus the secrets venus could vary important because they could help learn more about life other planets and even selve mysteries our own planet throughout the writing the author uses stong deviance support his claim that should explore and study the planet venus paragraph four the author shows that venus already has some similar geographical features earth and also says used possibly have even more similar traits the author claims has things such mountains craters and valleys and could used have oceans too they use some logic too and state that the conditions may not easy venus but are survivable paragraph five the author continues use logic and deviance the writing paragraph seven this paragraph stated that scientist have already created some electronics that can last least three weeks the harsh venus conditions this proves that can least send robot explore venus help better understand venus the last paragraph the writing the author claims that solve the challange venus has presented will only find more amazing things find that will furthur our knowlege our imaginations gaining knowlege this planet will lead into gaining even more challange and endeavours solve throughout the article the challange exploring venus the author supported his claim well that humans should explore and study venus using strong deviance and logic they showed how could lead fining out new things about life other planets and even our own they also proved that their good reason not besides the fact that the conditions are slightly dangerous,4
the face some people don believe the face mars natural landform they believe that aliens created some people also believe that was not actually found earth jim garvin chief scientist for nasa mars exploration program has compared natural landforms earth michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times better than the original photos taken the viking took while but jim was able prove jim garvin says reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho that natural landform found earth also says rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were says this because some people believe that was not found mars michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times better than the original viking pictures the passage states thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all was then official that the face was not created aliens natural landform garvin has proven that the face natural landform found mars gave examples what natural landforms could look like earth viking captured amazing photos the face michael was able snap better picture than the viking photos people still not believe that natural landform but jim has proven,3
could the new technology called facial action coding system enable computers indentify human emotions yes the new techonology could enable the computers ability detect hauman emotions help the school enviroment the professors thomas huang and nicu sebe who are experts developing better ways for humans and computers communicate are trying find that computer constructs how feel help the professors huang relies psychologist paul eckman creates the system emotions that could detected are the six basic emotions that are associated with each characteristic movements the facial muscles are happiness anger surprise disgust fear and sadness all those emotions can make you have you face certain way for example when you are really surprised your mouth could drop wide open and your eyebrows could raise with the new technology using video imagery tracks the movement real painted face looking the different units identifying mixed emotions helping identify huang observes that vinci studied human anatomy help them paint facial muscles clearly state specific emotions the computer stores similar anatomical info code vinci code you were school and seem bored confused excited and the computers webcam looking you and changes what you are doing helps you all the look your face that could help students get engaged into theria school work for that work the new technology huang states that most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication computers need understand that the computer understands how you feel without taling could help lot how student feel about their assignments conclusion new technology could have positive feedback how student perform there school work the professors and the psychologist could making great new technology help the performance students allowing computer have facial action closing system could help teachers and students out school,3
driverless cars are actually good and bad idea there good because its almost like cruise control just more advanced but also bad because what the human driver falls asleep and doesn hear the car say take over that they about hit something they good pros and cons but believe the cons took over its very risky until the driverless cars can everything like human the driverless cars could have malfunction and blow the human wouldn able stop personally believe better just continue with the humans driving the car third reason why agaist the driverless cars they just don want drive there are many other options first reason why agaist the driverless cars the pros and cons the cons have way more effect than the pros the pros are good because make history and but its also very dangerous you have pay attention not only the good but the bad second because the cars could malfunction any given time just safer continue making the cars like today the year third argument they want just roven around there are many other options there are taxis buses personal drivers subways and trains would perfumer they something that safe then something that cool this why against the driverless cars,3
many people earth can argue that the face mars alien artifact others can argue well with the explanation why the face not alien artifact way there such evidence this formation exact subject matter alien artifact this not bya any case true because there absolute evidence that there ancient civilization living mars the face just natural land form and what called meas and the piles camaras have improved over the years than what scientists used twenty five years ago the case conspiracy theorist they can give you some facts and ideas support their idea aliens and that they were the ones that created the face there just not enough evidence support their claim that there not even single drop evidence that there ancient civilization living mars the text unmasking the face mars stated that few scientist belied that the face was alien artifact because the mgs was sent into mars take photos eighteen years later after the viking missions ended there still more reasons say that the face not created aliens because the face just natural landform like here earth there many and many landforms the text said that when the moc snapped picture the face revealed natural landform there was alien monument after all what the picture really shows the martian equivalent butte mesa land forms that are common the american west even before when the space team took pictures the face their technology was not sophisticated was eighteen years later when they took another picture the face and reveling martian mesa there better technology with camaras then there was twenty five years ago the article says that mgs flew over the first time michael malin and his moc teem snapped picture ten time sharper than the original viking photos this indicated that the team had better equiped camaras than they had when the original photos were taken although some conspiracy theorist might give off some logical information that ther could civilization there still sign nor any evidence that gives off aliens living mars and even creating the face over all that case there still logical evidence and reasons why people must think over twice before concluding the idea another civilization living our solar system who knows maybe one day there could beings that would encounter someday,4
the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the danger throughout the article the author supports this claim very well the author gives few real benefits for exploring venus the author continuously tells the readers about advancing technology thanks human curiosity the author even gives problems and solutions explore venus the end the article paragraph the author says striving meet the challenges presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors this means that exploring venus will gain knowledge and prepared for future missions with similar conditions paragraph talks about venus past like how may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system with knowledge venus past could not only learn about venus more but could use that information and compare earth predict some earth future that how venus benefits outweighs its dangers paragraph talks about nasa interest study venus doing nasa creating better technology and pushing the human race further for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such cognitions with advancing technology thanks the interest venus can now create objects that can survive over degrees fahrenheit venus surface for three weeks that how studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers because advance with the study throughout the article many problems are brought with solutions for example paragraph talks about venus dangerous conditions that aren fit for humans but paragraph nasa believes they can solve this problem allowing scientists float above the chaotic conditions which would allow humans venus and study better paragraph introduces the problem that humans wouldn able gather lot information they are ship orbiting venus because its dense atmosphere paragraph the article says systems that use mechanical parts can made more resistant pressure heat and other forces paragraph gives the solution the problem paragraph this turn can also relate the fact that our technology would advance thanks the planning for venus that how the author supports his claim giving problems and solutions explore venus which negates some the dangers with insight from venus advancing technology and solutions problems the author supports his claim the author tells about benefits exploring venus the author tells how technology would advance thanks the curiosity humans possess for venus the author tells solutions problems which negates some the dangers therefore the author supports his claim very well since gave reasons why the study venus worthy pursuit and why some the dangers aren big enough threat stop humans,5
dear state senator feel need adress that changing election popular vote for the president the united states over keeping electoral votes opinion better for the people because brings the people together many ways the people the deserve make great decisions like these account the fact that the people make most what have america today and though work hard and may have fights sometimes still make choices together voting being one them and this unifies even more allowing this will bring sense unification already consider doing selfless acts just make peace example our taxes pay doctors polices etc salaries least deserve decide who enforces laws another thing begin this reasoning let this question asked what the government doing right now this very moment who really knows for sure not the people the really haven honest clue what really going behind the government wouldn too wise for entrust the government into completely making every decision decisions which could perfectly make ourselves not only gives the people sense unification also gives sense direction that feel that are not being blindly controlled the government commence the third reasoning let another question asked first say for example that you work double shift full time day and night just keep food your childrens and wies plate clothes their backs and roof over their heads when the bills roll your paycheck isn won arrive for weeks and you still haven enough pay you may have work overtime possible pick another job one gets rich off the government clearly and yet work hard just make now here the question doesn all feel worth when the paycheck come okay now for the deeper question what the sense feeling you specifically get when you see you happy families faces now for the point our work pays off work for the government least most does together whether put bread the table otherwise now wouldnt give that sense freedom that hard workers get make great decisions like these would all these things bring together more than might even think whether its families friends just nation conclude all the reasonings arguing change election popular vote for the president the which are the sensation unification direction and freedom obliged state that this just one thing that finally unifies and brings the people together those three senses that this gives seemingly small yet great difference and even though most don realize definitely there,3
state senator electoral college what complex process has become writing you today explain you why the electoral college should held you know this process which starts off meeting the electors discuss and vote for the president and the vice president united states then counting the electoral votes the congress the electoral college isnt small thing consists electors requires least votes elect the president every candidate running has his her own group electors most states have its called winner take all system which basically gives all the electors the opportunity the winning presidential candidate when the president elected the governor sets certificate ascertainment which concludes list names all the candidates who ran for president the certificate then sent congress and the national archives apart the presidential election and history has come attention that there has been majority people who not agree with the electoral college and wish for abolished source says and quote under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president who turn elect the president although this source only has one argument against the electoral college which called the disaster factor explains that the fiasco was the biggest mistake century and how couve been worse all honesty was going worse then wouldbe but did not why they spend much time stressing about something that does not exist also mentions that tie were happen the electoral votes the election would thrown out the house representatives and the state delegations vote for the president tie were appear doubt very much that will happen because the people campaign for the president they want the white house they persuade people causing one have most votes but all worst cases that why there vice president the vice president serves purpose and should treated like there are reasons keep out electoral college certainty outcome everyone president swing states big states and avoid run off elections certainty outcome includes that yes anything possible dispute over the outcome electoral college but very less likely than popular vote the winning candidates share the college past his share popular vote everyone president includes that the college requires presidential candidate have trans regional appeal meaning that has region the electoral votes are already enough votes select the president swing states consists the winner take all system mentioned earlier voters are more likely pay attention the campaign toss states really understand what happening even though they already know what their final depictions the most humble and heartfelt voters should the ones decide the election and course the big states other words the larger the state equals the more attention from presidential candidates campagna than smaller state example would that florida recieved electoral votes for the current president rather than wyoming which only got and finally conclude the avoid run off elections the electoral college avoids the problem elections which candidate favorite there course pressure run off when candidate wins majority cast votes end this letter sent you state senator have explained you the process the electoral votes also explained the reasons why you should keep the electoral college held please rethink this over and consider the best option keep held the electoral college best wishes,3
driverless cars come with some benefits but alot more negatives the negatives are very costly and could put lot people danger driverless cars could not only cause alot confusion and controversy between manufactuers and customers but can also affect the roads rules and laws the road driverless cars were put into action these cars would have incredibly smart and able function and respond thier surroundings such other cars and pedestrians this could cost alot money make happen and would also put the driver and other people risk were glitch accident were happen because failure driverless car alot controversy between the manufacturer and the customer would heat not only that but more accidents would most likely happen the roads are split between driverless cars and driven cars laws would probably past seperate driven and non driven cars the road costing more money build more roads ways transport using driverless cars not only would there alot money being invested into driverless cars but also alot advanced technology and even the passing new laws prevent roads get crowed and prevent accidents driverless cars are not good idea becasue all the negatives and all the risk involved,3
everyone seems think that driverless cars would great here tell you why they are not they cant navigate through certain situations these situations they require drivers assitance they wouldn able function without assistance from humans seems very unreliable when you are approaching accident construction they become driver cars for example lets say you are approaching construction site everyone fell asleep the car including the driver the driverless car says driver help needed but one awake this car going stop matter what and cause accident well whose fault sice this car stopped and caused accident whos fault would the manufacturers fault the drivers fault personally think its the manufactures fault would not only false advertising the car but also put the passangers the car danger the car was legit then should drive its own another arguement how could these cars obey the laws the road the answer they couldn they would run stop signs they couldn deild the right away they wouldn know from turn red certain streets how would these cars know train commings how would these cars adjust bad road conditions conclusion think these cars are much liability certain situations these cars fail there many things worry about when thinking about these cars there are many questions ask when dealing with situations the end think automatic cars are unsafe for our roads,3
the planets are fascinating part science they have characteristics that can not even imagine and facts that long learn about the mask that appeared mars was first spotted the year can strongly say that the face mars not created aliens know this because scientists figured that was butte mesa landforms that are common around the american west also when they shot the pictures was taken during winter when normally cloudy not good time take photo the face mars not alien creation but marian equivalent buttle mesa this implies that the science behind this that the landform mars non other than mesa scientist also know that mesa landforms are common enough especially around cydonia this shows that the unusual formation was definately butte but this one just happened make look like face viking shot photo face like portrait this was taken during winter cloudy time the year this demonstrates that this picture not the most reliable photograph and april team moc researchers went out took sharper photo much more reliable thean the original vikings photo this reveil that the landform was very much natural landform though this rock formation did very much resemble human head know that this mesa was created shadows not aliens the face mars show that things may appear different from what they seem next time lets just leave the experts tell the science behind things,3
cars have been popular and widely used ever since they were invented they offer fast and efficient form transportation across both long and short distances this aspect cars may appear extremely beneficiary and useful everyday life but there are always downsides great inventions especially the invention the car more and more people from all around the world are realizing the harms that car usage brings and are beginning abandon their cars altogether the most apparent reason why cars are damaging because the great amount greenhouses gases they emit into the atmosphere they also bring about pollution and smog with them finally and maybe surprisingly some people are actually happier without these pollution monsters start cars expel shocking amounts greenhouses gases from their tailpipes limiting usage these automobiles the amount green house gases can significantly reduced according the source german suburb life goes without cars cars produce percent the greenhouse gas emissions places like europe but eyepopping percent the united states where there heavy car usage this lot noxious gas that being put into the atmosphere and poses serious harm the people living these cities greenhouse gases are especially maleficent form pollution because greenhouse gases tend trap heat and other types pollution from escaping the atmosphere leaving filth the air that are then absorbed the lungs choking cities rosenthal this without doubt serious problem but can corrected simply not driving frequently according the end car culture but america love affair with vehicles seems cooling the pattern persists and many sociologists believe will will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation the second largest source america emissions just behind power plants rosenthal simply reducing car usage these harmful toxins can removed from the atmosphere pollution another quite obvious reason why restricting car usage beneficial cars release other toxins and gases well that contribute greatly pollution and smog paris bans driving due smog tells the story how driving had banned for days because the worst pollution the city has ever seen according this passage congestion was down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog last week paris had micrograms particulate matter per cubic meter compared with brussels and london reuters found duffer this ton particulate matter that will all breathed the people there they are not removed paris brussels and london are not only the cities plagued this pollution from cars the smog rivaled beijing china which known one the most polluted cities the world duffer smog from pollution negatively effects many aspects life but the worst was that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer air trap car emissions duffer this phenomenon forces the people breathe these particles into their lungs pollution terrible occurence that tags along with car usage but simply banning cars with even numbered linense plates off the road for one day the smog greatly lightened severity enough for the city paris lift the ban one wants pollution their city and simply cutting back car usage pollution can greatly reduced for the benefit the people finally and most surprisingly people are actually happier and less stressed without these modern horses heidrun walter mother who lives the city vauban germany community devoid cars says the passage suburb life goes without cars when had car was tense much happier this way rosenthal carlos arturo plaza man bogota colombia also commented during bogota day without cars the source car free day spinning into big hit bogota good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution selsky this may seen little puzzling first why people would not enjoy fast and convenient transportation but then the answer becomes pretty obvious without cars parks sport centers and other outdoor recreational places have started pop more amd more the streets cities once bustling with cars the roads are much less congested and new shops and food centers have appeared well limiting cars pleases people many different aspects their life cars may appear helpful times but reality citizens are better off without these transportation machines not only they greatly pollute the air and cause smog they also spew out noxious greenhouse gases that cause more damage the society whole finally and probably most importantly the citizens themselves enjoy life better when these cars are out them although this doesn mean cars should stop being manufactured altogether people should think twice before jumping their car next time,5
the solar system venus the socon planet from the sun simple see from the distant but safe vantage point earth and venus the most closet planet earth twin unus the closest planet earth items density and size maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down unus more the three decades and ethic atmosphere almost percent carbon divide blankets venus and also notable venus has the hottest surface tempur any planet solar system venus covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life and was just like the earth thirty plus miles above the surface tempur would still tasty around levelers farenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating,1
does not work because very fare the millions voters the mainly because alot the states doot even see for the presidential campaign also because not winner takes all like for most states not fair mainly just because bad publicity also because the presidential campaign could come down one persons vote and depending bias not would very unfair the electoral college does alson work because was created our founding fathers which was all the way back when this country was first starting out the ways that they old and does not work anymore these are the reasons why think that the electoral college does not work anymore todays modern times where all out dated,2
you think you could live without car some cities across the world people dont even use cars being car free good idea because reduces the level pollution the enviroment and saves resources begin with being car free would better off because reduces the level pollution for example paris typically has more smog than other european capitals stated robert duffer the article paris bans driving due smog paris made driving ban that fined different drivers certain days going their licence plate numbers this law caused the smog clear just enough for the french uplift the ban another example where being car free reduced pollution bogata columbia where anually they day without cars violators faced fines quoted from andrew selsky article car free day spinning into big hit bogota business man carlos arturo plaza said that day good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution finally being car free good idea because reduces the amount pollution put into the air conclusion order reduce pollution and save resources more cities should think about being car free,2
have you ever woken one day and thought what life would like without cars can there advantages limiting car usage there have been people studying this and wondered what life would without cars trucks paris they enforced law that stated monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered leave their cars home pay euro fine the same rule would apply for even numbered license plates the next day the reason that paris did this was because they had days near record pollution and banned cars help clear the air the global city would limiting car usage for america advantage wouldnt you know why the reason being because there are alot more americans not making money not trying make money americans could not afford new cars and the unemployed weren going work anyway april the number miles driven per person was nearly percent below the peak and equal where the country was january whether thats because americans not making enough income purchase new cars teens and adults prefering take the tram bus said spivak whose son lives san francisco and has his own car but takes the area rapid transit when can even though takes longer than driving limiting car usage also starting become advantage other countries well bogota colombia they had day without cars and people hiked biked skated took buses work like paris they goal was reduce smog and they violated the rules they were fined whopping businessman carlos arturo plaza said good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution also parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced broad smooth sidewalks when its all said and done research shows that there are advantages limiting car usage some countries are taking the extra step try and solve the problems pollution they country paris for example are giving people that are out driving monday with odd number license plates euro fine and the same goes for even the next day help with they problems with smog even america teens and adults would rather take the tram the bus being able drive isnt priority some people america colombia they have day without cars and they goal well reduce smog and pollution they country and giving fines those who don follow the rules overall would advantage limit car usage,3
the electoral colleges shouldn taken away just because its minor flasks still should keet because the winner take all system just awards electors the winning presidential candidate the out comes the electoral colleges are almost certain and hassel figure out who won and who didn also less likely for there run off election because the balance the electoral colleges but just can perfect there also some defects like when under the electoral colleges you don voto for the president but for slate electors which they vote for the president the got the most votes also the electors can vote for whom they want even who you voted for got the most votes the elector might choose different president ading that there has been some errors like two slates electors bengt sent congress there also opposite side this and the people who don want vote under electoral colleges because they want themselves choose the president but some times this also back fires because there control over who they choose there can winning land slide tie then will take way more time choose who will the president besides the majority the population wants direct vote because they feel control who will make not,2
the development driverless cars good idea the features that these cars have are more advanced less car accidents would accu with the driverless cars the drivers these driverless cars would more alert the development driverless cars better option for drivers first the driverless cars have features that are more advanced then the ones where drivers have drive all the time one driverless car for example like the toyota prius has alot features that are advanced the article states the features the toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor also states the more important feature the driverless car the most important bit technology this system the spinning sensor the roof dubble lidar uses laser beams forma constantly updating model the car surroundings the combination all this necessary for the driverless car mimic the skill human the wheel the combination all these advanced features are well put together second there would less car accidents with the driverless cars even though its driverless still alerts the driver the car detects danger faster and can save people from having accidents when they would driving themself they would realize the danger too late the article states within years those sensors had become more advanced detect and respond the danger out control skids rollovers also states that the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes the individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone these features would help the driverless cars have less car accidents third the drivers the driverless cars would more alert the driverless cars have the combinations features and more features been added them that car drivers will more alert then ever the article states manufacturers are also considering using cameras watch that drivers are remaining focused the road while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver the car also lets the driver when take over when the driverless car can something specific situation alerts the driver the article states the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over also states has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object these features help keep the driver alert with the driverless car the development driverless car better option than the normal cars the driverless car has more advanced features which have more techonology then the normal ones there would less car accidents with the features that offers the driver would more alert the driverless car then the normal car,4
there are few advantage limiting car usage tailed about the passage some say that not having car muh better heidrun walter says when had car was always tense much happier this way this movement also helps reduce greenhouse gas from tailpipes passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states many experts expect public transport serving suburbs play much larger role new six year federal transportation bill approved this year says goldberg percent appropriations have law gone highways and only percent other transport also you can save lots money not having car cost buy space for the car some vauban families sold their car just move there stores are placed walk away main street rather than mails along some distant highway,2
luke joined group called the seagoing cowboys being seagoing cowboy sounds really fun would love travel the world could join the seagoing cowboys think would really fun would amazing travel the world could only allow guys join though only allows guys would not rest until they let become seagoing cowboy would join the program because would get explore the world also would get travel love travel and explore one time when was exploring woods found huge deer stand and family racoons then when was traveling missouri and little sister proper name were getting ready watch movie the car when saw this gigantic jail house was crazy wouldn join the program because would have leave family and they probably don have good food have never left family only left them when was going friends house stay the night now about the food one time had eat something bad made sick the program had that kind food would probably either die get really sick jump over borad even the water below freezing cold that what would joined the seagoing cowboys had join the seagoing cowboys would fun could terrible,2
position the driverless cars are definitely while the whole idea interesting and fascinating also extremly dangerous maybe the daythe actually perfect and deemed safe would accept but right now opinion the entire things definitely because while people would need have alert drivers aloof them arent and even when have driverless cars the cars are going still need some human amount interaction and the person for instance drunk they aren going seen very useful people are most likely going take advantage this car and this whole thing and know its not going pretty when they just really not for there are companies such general motors trying but they would have change all the roads for which obviously way expensive ever engineers berkeley tried something similar they used magnets with alternating polarity and still also wouldnt work out because the road expenses everything that has been done still needs somkid human interaction and believe that the way that should that nothing bad happens because like paragraph they talk about even traffic laws changed new laws would needed order cover liability the case accident the technology fails and someone injured who the one fault the driver the manufacturer agree with this one would know whose fault would honestly just taking unnecessary risk putting live danger those around the smart cars and those them there alot done and there alot come because these companies are making several advancements and several attempts they aren going stop isn just make things easier believe that alot these people just think would cool less work for the person and thats just going start revolutionizing the fact that humans don need work let have someone else for don like all,4
you should participate the seagoing cowboys program because from luke point vew seems fun luke had fun playing baseball and volleyball games with the cowboys the text stats the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games the empty holds where animals had been housed joining the seagoing cowboys also fun because you get see different parts the world the text also stats took about two weeks cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast the united states and month get china another reason why you should join the seagoing cowboys program you get see different kinds people the text also stats made more aware people other countries and their need also will make your family host the text stats and that awareness stayed with him leading his family host number international students and exchange visitors for many years also fun because get play alot games the text stats table tennis tournaments fencing boxing reading whittling and games also helped pass the time this proves that being seagoing cowboys program,2
limiting car usage one the best things people can their everyday lives something different for once life shouldn dragging repeating cycle every day leaving your car home and riding public transportation carpooling with friends walking biking the options are endless there are ton excellent and viable options that also happen help reduce carbon emissions and let you feel good about yourself helping the environment just some reasons are happiness excercise and reducing carbon emissions not everyday get ride car with friends school just imagine every four people drove school everyday instead driving themselves think all the emissions that would stop heck even riding the school bus lowers carbon emissions this all reality cities slowly started removing cars and making shops and food more within easy transportation distance would definitely make difference the looming threat the ozone layer holes and carbon pollution even having one day events such bogota colombia car free day seen source would let people realize how big this and the difference would make everyday life good way happiness something people that live modern united states may experience scarcely not often they think present life consists huge amount stress humans having car may seem like facilitates life first but just becomes burden that most people feel forced carry putting things the trunk and later forgetting them paying for expensive gasoline driving back and forth places how tiring drive for long times and the biggest car polluters traffic congestion are just some the reasons why definitely don look forward getting car future ever would rather ride bike and take bus while exercising and transporting myself get places the same time and laughing the people traffic jams,3
france germany united states colombia and other countries are taking actions the problems that the cars are making true that cars are helpful and make the life easier some persons but lately the conocer how this machines affect the ecosystem have being increasing that why countries have come with different projects try limit the amount cars they are around their cities see from different restrictive the limiting cars can good thing and produce result that are favorable everyone through the years they have been several projects reduction car circulation and visible that the population have apted the type living that cities have imposed one example this vauban germany were percent the families not have car and percent sold car move there with that example can see that people can get used live where cars are not necesary have when had car was always tense uch happier this way these are the word one the resident that city that get used lifestyle without car that city people get used walk which more healthy and not produce any harm the ecosystem other cities like paris have made laws control the amount pollution cars produce since this capital have more smog than other european capitals making this awful fact with the actions they have made banting even numbered license plate mondays they have reduced the amount smog which good another example what happening bogota colombia where you can see car free days where people any other mean transportations except for personal cars when the actions both cities atre taken visible the cange the enviroment this great ideas help the clouded cities reduce their levels pollination and incentive people use the car less united state that country that produces lot pollution have seen good changes the tendencia the people using car studies have prove that the amount new cars buried have decrease the last years also there have been drop the amount people getting license this show that county support public transportation and make programs that will make people use less the cars they will have positive result walking and using bike good for the personal health the less using the cars help the fight against pollution and avoid the rise temperature the earth obesity and pollution are big problem the last decades but they both share something common they can fought using less car and walking being this the perfect statement that prove why limiting the car usage will advantage,3
the future for cars expanding over the course the years driverless cars should not delved modern day society this because one does not make any sense two you would have make too many changes society for the cars work properly driverless cars would cause many problems modern society for instance presently traffic laws are written with assumption that the liability the case accident other words the laws for driving were made under the circumstances that human would behind the wheel all times order for computer charge car the government would need shift the laws around make that possible the government should not change the law around for computer that not liable because technicalities can happen anytime the road also why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver this say that the car that the manufacturers make supposed driverless but still needs driver behind the wheel guide specifically what the whole point making car that supposed controled computer but still needs human help its like making purposeless car there need for driverless car does not necessarily drive itself driverless cars should not created today world because will cause serious confusion depending computer take the wheel car bad idea and then making driverless car that still needs assistants from humans does not pursuit the purpose making the invention therefore this creation needs little bit more work life changing experiment,3

driverless cars has its cons and pros but would say bad idea drivers have already enough their plate when driving because not only they have keep themselves safe but also the people the car and other cars that share the same road also the coast this car would outrageous most americans would not able afford that luxury the driverless car also not something that represents its name when think about driverless car think about cars that have need for divers even the passenger seat these cars are not what they say they are they only can drive when its easy and they alera you when they could not able drive anymore companies are going makes driverless car they should all out and not excite the consumers with hopes and lies america will always come down one thing money how much time and research will take produce this car the late general motors created concept car that could run special test track track was embedded with electrical vale that sent radio signals recieve the front end the car also engineers berkeley tried something similar but they used magnets with alternating polarity binary code while both these test and ideas were great invention the article stated was just too expensive this century technology different more advance america trillion dollars debt this past year and the debt only rising these cars would undergo production that would lot money produce and they would sell them for lot more the buyers luxury many americans can afford then they would left with buyers and ton used cars would truely waste money thats even saying they can compose the car correctly there are also many other factors when comes testing and trying produce these driverless cars most states iligan test computer driven cars where the companies like gmc bmw and other companies that produce cars will test their cars testing the cars safety and how works must but what are the car companies going they ever get approved with their car laws every state would have shift and new laws would have created also new insurance policy would have created all this adds lot money something most amercian not have ever case accident who falt woul driver manufactuers with the new laws that would have passes with this driverless car new liability coverages would have passes and bought the consumers many question will arris fromto consumers their car insurance will defiantly just cae accident accident ever did occur the hand the driverless car that never alerted the driver take control insurance would have cover course but its not the drivers falt for malfunction the car the manufacture should the one the pay the accident another con would the manufactury should take the responsiblity and even bigger accident happend like death and the driver blamed the driverless car who would jail then these are many the factors one should think about before putting the driverless car the market tesla has projected release for car capable driving autopilot precent the time mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have cars that can drive themselves the driverless cars are already undergo production laws have been passed yet that could able drive this driverless car except california nevada florida and the district columbia have allowed only test cars these big car compiles decide start working and producing theses cars they are going have while until they can start selling them due state allows american drive thats more money they spent production that they will not see back right away they will cubase amercian more debt,5
the best option substitute planet our solar system venus our world get destroyed eny other entity people could venus because the planet more likely our own planet mars also very likely the earth but this particular case will focus venus first one the reasons should consider venus option live our planet gets destroyed for disease apocalypse any other reason because venus our solar system this really big advantage because the population don have travel for long time found another place live there lot other planets people can because there are more likely the earth but there are years light far from our planet and don still have the technology that other planets also the temperature the atmosphere venus similar the temperature the earth this really important because can planet that lot cooler hooter that the earth for simple reason people would die any other planet that has high low temperature also not only people would die animals and plants too people need plants and animals eat don have animals and plants don have food and medicine and people would die finally the size venus almost the same size the earth people can planet that smaller that the earth because wouldn enough space live bigger nice people would have bigger planet and population can grow but can the planet smaller conclusion the people have leave the earth and another planet the best option would venus even mars because these two planets are more likely the earth and there are the nearest planets have because there are the same solar system,4
this face that was found mars couldn have been alien because there wouldn just one found there would been more also you have read the article about the face says paragraph two scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh that quote states that the shadows are making look like human face april mars global surveyor flew over cydonia and ended getting picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos paragraph seven where says all the information says thousands anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all this means that after they went cydonia they discovered was just natural landform but people still doesn want believe was just rock that was shaped naturally not aliens understand how people think made alien because looks much like human you could see you see nose eyes and mouth which makes you think someone there had create that there way nature could just form perfect looking human face like that paragraph twelve the article says that lave dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars that proves that nature could create something like that plus says that was just shadows making look like that that face just another rock formed nature and people just need let there aliens found discovered there there way and while they are giving that rock much attention they are just making the nasa people just more paid for the attention that face just rock with shadows making look that way and nothing more,3
should our way voting the united states changed the way vote today through the electoral college each president get certain number electoral votes and that how vote specific leaders the electoral college process was established our constitution compromise this way could elect our president vote congress and election our president citizens who qualify not time for change the electoral college first off the electoral college specified process this process consists electors majority electoral votes mandatory elect the president the way this works every state has certain number electoral votes mostly due population for example larger state with large population will have more electoral votes than smaller state also each candidate running for president your state has their own group elector these electors are chosen based opon the candidate political party but state laws vary how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are there presidential election held every four years the tuesday after the first monday the month november when you vote you are helping choose your state electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candiate electras after your presidential election your governor prepares certificate ascertainment showing all the candidates who ran for president your state and with the names their respective electors this also shows which electors will representing your state the meeting the electors december the election year addition the process the electoral college should changed the are even number presidents that tried abolish the electoral college richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce adn the afl cio all agreed abolishing proven that percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now most voters today are significantly uninformed some not even know what whom they are voting for some these people are not even citizens yes some states require identification although others not direct election would more specified and easier for people choose and use some people overlook these detail while others enjoy the system because the power provides them there are multiple errors the voting process there are certain people that not even possess high school degree let alone college degree that vote just because they want the massive supply ignorance and pride that fall into play with the electoral college under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president they choose but for slate electors who turn elect the president for instance you wanted vote for specific person you would vote for slate electors pledged that person this method voting kurupt and should abolished the people american should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the largest election crisis century the system could have lead much worse than that consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for choosing electors adn that those electors could alwars defy the will the people conclusion why the electoral college unhealthy this system voting outdated and has many flaws throughout its system without this system being changed could have tremendous affect the future the united states this irrational system lacks basis reality the arguments against direct elections are spurious best difficult say but the electoral college general was mistake,3

many people seem believe that the face mars alien activity however reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same heigh the face mars that quote jim garvin cheif scientist for nasa mars explanation program states that mainly recognizes from the land forms earth rather than seeing alien activity when the first picture was taken technology was not great now even each pixel the image spans meters compared oto meters per pixel the best viking photo meaning the qualify picture taken which convinced most people alien did not have great even decent quality april mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera mos team snapped picture ten times sharper than the orginal viking photo after taking the picture thousands anxious surfers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all when this statement was said not everyone was satisfied the face mars located degrees north martian latitude where was winter april cloudy time the year the red planet the camera board had mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face perhaps said skeptics alien markings are hidden the haze which that reasonable argument but not being positive too risky throw into the public garvin made arguement that states rule thumb you can descend things digital image times bigger than the pixel size added there were objets this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shack you could see what they were using all the evidence and arguments and just seeing the picture was just strange occurence that natural landform found mars was shape human face also the fact that the picture was taken about fourty years ago changes lot the amount and the quality technology has changed tremendously,4
the article facial recognition software called the facial action coding system allows for computers better understand and identify human emotions the software was created paul eckman who psychologist the facs technology used analyze several muscles upon the face determine the current emotion the person people who are using the software many feel like this technology could possibly used change the education system analyzing the faces students who appear bored uninterested the curriculum that being covered but the cost run and maintain the systems that are needed run the facs within schools and other facilities may create issue because costly and not everyone going have the funding put into such system classroom every student taught the same lesson and given the same lecture the same exact manner every student sitting around them their faces just like any other human being can determine their current emotions towards the subject they are learning the topic that they are covering facs has the ability analyze all major muscles the human face which are responsible for showing emotion every single day paul eckman psychologist created facs analyze the facial muscles the human face and determine the current emotion someone behind computer screen along with eckman huang explains how facial expressions play role human emotion the facial expressions for each human emotion are universal observes huang even though individuals show varying degrees expression like not smiling broadly with the invention this technology some feel that could change the educational system analyzing the emotions student towards the subject they are learning the article huang explains how classroom computer could analyze the emotions student during lesson lecture classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor and while this may seem like good idea the technology used for facs can not run home due the complex algorithms that uses and the results may the same for school computers which run similar less capable software than that home this mentioned paragraph where explains the same reasoning why the software can not used home computer another possible issue could come when schools not have the funding nor the room for computers every classroom adjust the education system while the technology may innovative way change how students learn the cost update computers install software and manage would very costly for school system continue with doing conclusion the facial action coding system great way enable computers communicate more clearly with humans but may not necessarily ready for common use within schools other places just yet the algorithms used the sofware are too complex for most operating systems used within homes and schools and may need further development before released the public for common use addition the idea good for the future and may change the way the education system works for generations students come,4
while having computer adapt your emotional state whether bored and change some activity that more fun the usefulness still not there for computers read students emotional expressions because lot school work could boring and tedious but does not change the fact that still have the work computers were doing the job teachers they would lose their jobs even could know exactly what student was feeling are sure would want know that would almost like stripping away ones privacy and individualism using computers read students emotional expressions should not used the purpose education not more fun than productive the use this technology could help students focus but the end the day the work still inevitable being angry can only helped something you like and sure you would not like doing math homework made fun until proven effective this technology should not applied just yet teachers should work the energy their classrooms therefore getting better results out students according the text for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face that case really don need any help tell how fellow friend student feeling sometimes students are best left themselves knowing everything about how they are feeling and when could feel pretty invading although computer being able adapt students emotion would cool that technology really neccessary according the text could modify the lesson like effective human instructor teachers would only work being effective then wouldn all these shenanigans students should surrounded positivity when they come school for that any student should willing work and enjoy the process coming school should not feel like being read ourselves were assignment what this type technology malfunctions what student does not really feel the way the computer saying does getting accused feeling accused could sometimes trigger bad emotion some students consequently the use this technology has classroom value can computer tell how all think and learn substitute for teacher this technology could never useful teacher who can fully comprehend what student having trouble with need more advancements technology order for computer think and act like teacher would although technology seems very ahead its time still have long way,4
why would people use this type technology read students emotions and why valuable tell you why valuable also tell you wrong this tell you right this think this type technology great read students facial expressions because student feeling sad and the school didn know the school can help that kid there something wrong they could figure out weather that kid always bored certain class maybe the teacher can make the class funner they can use this technology see kid angry certain class and that the school can ask why the student gets angry that class like getting bullied just hates the class all for this technology think really cool but there are also the negatives this technology lets say student dosen want anyone watch him when trying work when home doing stuff students don want their privacy invaded students don want people know what feelings they are going thorugh then maybe they should this that opinion this new technology don know wrong this the right thing think they should take vote students want this not,3
driverless cars are our future would impact the way people focuses the road belive that driverless cars will affect peoples saftey way that driverless cars can negative thing because people are not full control the car what would happen the car all sudden starts doing something wrong and the driver can not anything about paragraph number says that the car can lot things its own they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidente also people were interested buying the driverless car would average person able effort paragraph number clearly says that the car needs many tools and special equipment able driverless car google modified toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and intertidal motion sensor not only would the car itself cost alot would also take millions able fix all the roads order for the car able drive the roads paragraph number states that the car requiems magnets the road able read the messages binary code but would too expensive these smart road systems worked surprisingly well but they require massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply too expensive practical finally one biggest concerns that the driverless car does not need the driver all times would make easier for younger kids get the car start and take off paragraph number says that all takes the drivers hands the wheel for the car the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel since the driverless car can alot its own the car could make easy for young child get and leave while not being watched properly conclusion belive that people should keep driverless cars off the road for many reasons for example people are not having full control the car the car may not affordable the average person would take millions for the road fixed and able have driverless cars work the roads finally would seriously dangerous for young child get the car and the car start driving its own,4
this face marking mars just natural landform scientist discovered mars many years ago and they did not see signs life this planet this face was not see this planet how can face just natural appear mars when one there why would nasa hide big discovery something like this the people nasa found out new there were any signs life mars would expect there newscast that soechting else that matter some scientist believe that alien made structure but other scientist believe just land formation just land formation because shadows are making its nose eyes and mouth others believe butte mesa which are land formations around the american west the image the face looks just like hill rounded very small mountain top the face even has changed over the years many things change erosion the weather believe just mesa that has changed over the years the markings were not hidden some kind alien haze was simply the weather planets other than earth have different kind weathers also there something the united states that simula the face small lava doom and the same height the face scientist believed that there somkid alien face mars but there isnt just mesa butte which small landmass there was ancient civilization still life mars would able see unless they are just great hindwing even there were civilizations mars wouldn able see more artifacts the land mass has also changed the pass years probably version wether there also shadows that are reflection over the land mass show its distinct characteristics like the nose mouth and eyes,3
lately there has been lot controversy with ways elect and which way more effective and what preferred the majority people the problem with that that many people are very biased when comes elections many poeple are raised with certain way that their parents might have thought them was correct and that was how they were taught elect although there not wrong way elect there are more effective and quicker ways personally think that the best way vote would through popularity electoral college compromise between election the president vote congress and election the president popular vote qualified citizens many people think that electoral college rubbish and complicated and agree according paragraph ten the passage the first sentence says under the electoral college voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president which means that more process vote through this system instead you inputting your opinion who you would like president you are basically saying that you believe that this slate electors have better idea who would better president the electoral college known extremely unfair voters paragraph thirteen the second sentence states because the winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states which true because the slate electors are obviously teams people who root for the same candidate which gives independent voters close chance they are not voting for the same candidate overall think that the electoral college way voting old and worn out and maybe its time that went out business and the popular vote takes its place with the popularity vote not only you get have chance choosing the president without the electoral vote canceling out your vote but you also get around saying that you part the reason why your candidate won many people may disagree with and say that opinion not good opinion but from all the statements that have heard will still continue believe that the popularity vote the best way vote,3
venus sometimes called evening star because the night make some lights the sky venus actually planet our solar sistem this planet the second from the sum venus along time earth this planet close earth size and occasionally cose earth too venus and mars this are the anothers planets orbit the summand different speed venus alwars around the the corner space venus almos have percent carbon dioxide blankets the others planets surface temperatures average over degrees and them pressure times greater than are experience our own planet the planet have surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features like valleys and mountains and craters sometimes will considerate give the long time frames space travel the national nasa has one particular compelling idea for around degrees the sistema have planets and the only one they live there the name earth this only one planet have water life orexigen air nitrogeno oido this thinks what really nedd real life this planet have animals birds and persons too,1
some areas germany mainly the suburb areas people don use cars often most people usually car usage pretty big problem therese days cars mainly cause pollution and smog but also causes some places ban driving partially can potentially stop therese problems start live like some parts germany can live car free city the earth pollution mainly caused cars although probably will not make law ban cars completely the can potentially start live like vauban germany vauban germany the residents this community are suburban pioneers living the outskirts freiburg near the french and swiss border vauban streets are completely car free vauban has only one place park large garages the edge development where car owner can buy space for about along with home result this percent not own cars and percent sold car move here vauban completed having cars has grown trend europe the united states and others take step back from auto usage this movement was called the smart movement furthermore the cons from using cars often mainly pollution and smog due near record pollution paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city result this prohibition nearly drivers were fined according reuters traffic was down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog trailed toward beijing china wich known one the most polluted cities inthe world diesel fuel was blame for this france has tax policy that favor diesel over gasoline diesels make percent vehicles france compared percent the average diesel engines the rest western europe sure enough the smog cleared fast enough for the french party rescind the ban partial driving add president obama ambitious goal curb the greenhouse gas emissions will recieve assist from incipient shift american behavior with its broad expanses and suburban ideals had been one the world prime car cultures after decades being love with cars america love affair with vehicles seems going down this continues many sociologists believe will will have beneficial implication towards carbon emissions and the environment since this happened there has been large drop percentage years olds from getting license while elders are likely retain their license they age such projections have important business implications even car buyers are mainly older buying less cars one lifespan rather than rejecting car culture outright conclusion car usage has made impact all across the globe really take this heart then can potentially live car free city limiting car usage great way prevent pollution and smog and also makes our the air more pure rather than breathing polluted air,2
land either from its self people having chunks taken out meteors the face mars could not have been created living life form for the planet unsafe for life the rocks created formation that looks like face because all the shadows and dust that were the picture mars was hit lot meteors and that also why looks like face the face mars most likely volcano mountain valley meteors have hit mars takes some the rocks and land away and could happen look like face made aliens but cant because natural land formation rocks many people would disagree because they believe that mars could have living lifeforms mars cant have living things because the air being toxic people think that there possibility for things able live mars but there way for life sustain mars because there where grow food and raise animals eat there oxygen breath animals would just die because lack oxygen,3
dear state senator you should keep the electoral college beacuse for one theres alot electors like around majority electoral votes required elect the president then after the presidental election your governor prepares certificate ascertainment listing all the candidates who ran for president your state along with the names their respective electors begin with under the amendment the constitution the district columbia allocated electors and treated like state for purposes the electoral college and for that saying the following discussion the word state also refers the district columbia also each and every candidate that running for president your state has his her own group electors the electors are generally chosen the candidate political party but state laws vary how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are foremost under the electoral college system voters vote not for the pesident but for slate electors who turn elect the president who are the electors they can anyone not holding public office who picks the electors the first place depends the state now understand sometimes state conventions partys central committee sometimes the presidental candidates themselves also sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate the single best argument against the electoral college what might call the electoral college what might call the disaster factor its basically whenever theres really good argument thats what its called constantin sometimes most people worry about the prospect tie the elections vote that case the election would thrown the house representatives where state delegations vote the president the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state candidates dont spend time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states then now its official the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments favor favor are mostly assertions without much basis reality end with thats why you should keep the electoral college because you should keep the electoral college beacuse for one theres alot electors like around majority electoral votes required elect the president then after the presidental election your governor prepares certificate ascertainment listing all the candidates who ran for president your state along with the names their respective electors,1
yes think technology good for everyone because your computer can tell when you are bored happy and sad feel like would great idea create something like this because you are bored your computer may have something different for you instead sitting there bored about the work you are doing also you are sad and not feeling liker your normal self the computer can cheer you doing something make you feel better what you have computer and can tell you having mixed emotions and the computer help you with that really think have this technology today everything would much better say everything would much better because kids today get bored fast and need something that would help them not get bored fast really should have computer that can tell happy sad and even mad because what help out them type emotions what sad and the computer help through the day what bored and the computer make work fun really wish had this type technology our generation today,2
venus like earth with just worser conditions living the closet planet earth terms density and size studying venus isn easy you can not really sample things the ground there that why nasa trying come with new inventions help study venus studying venus worthy pursuit because you meet the challenge presented venus you see the value will lead human curiosity into many equally intimidating endeavors paragraph the text states long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth this meaning that back then earth and venus were some what the same even now they still are venus can sometimes the nearest option visit for planetary visit when nasa sends humans study venus they face hostile conditions the surface venus and they venus would allow scientist float above the fray wont easy conditions but survivable for hor humans good and bad because they are hovering over the ground safely but the same time they cant take samples rock gas anything else from distance due trying study more venus nasa working other ways approach studying venus this how when nasa tries studying for venus hard for them because when venus sometimes around the corner space terms humans have sent numerous spacecrafts land spacecraft survived the lanning for more then few hours but hopefully they come out with successful ways study venus one day,3
people should participate being seagoing cowboy program because they not know what they would missing have seen people who helped others like this and changed their life forever positive way for both them luke met tons people animals and even went new places like europe china greece and italy you would new places and you would helping people who are need every day too luke enjoyed helping people and animals they even met people who you proby would not meet every day the trip changed luke life lot because proby would have never thought hosting number international students and even exchanged visitors every year even met more and more people even after the trip you never know who you could meet you join the seagoing cowboy program would change your life forever lot people could have gone hawaii and said saw sea horses but not lot people could say did the seagoing cowboy program and helped lots people you would have fun make new friends and even new family there soman reasons you seagoing cowboy and these are only few you would enjoy helping people every day,2
the author supports this idea that venus the closest planet the earth and that they want know more about the planet venus think that they tried send spacecraft know what venus and know what going the planet the text says that nasa working other approaches study venus some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface another reason the text why worth studying many researchers are woking innovation that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus think that worth pursing despite danger because can learn alot and also see what going other planets that way know what can change and protect the planet earth and not cause much more damage than what already cased our solar system with using robot and other techology better know what going venus,2
proper name and really recommend that you join the seagoing cowboys program this program can hard work some time ready for that there are also many benefits this trip myself had very exciting and memorable journey and you decide join you will have one too you join the seagoing cowboys program you get see tons new places got see places like europe and china also met and created bond with new people while was there saw new cultures this program allowed aware other countries and there needs not hearing about them but actually witnessing also had some fun board with the other members the seagoing cowboys club played games like fencing boxing and even table tennis now told you that the seagoing cowboys program was all fun and games would lying there lot work one time fell down slippery ladder didn die because did couldn have wrote this but did get hurt badly and cracked ribs there are many responsibilities while board had work with animals had load and unload them off the ship also second trip was the night watchman and job was check the animals every hour even though there work done the seagoing cowboys program was great opportunity for and could also great opportunity for you helping out aunt proper name farm prepared and maybe you have some preparation too this trip taught more than could have ever learned home the seagoing cowboys program really opened eyes hope again and hope see you there,3
think valuable use this technology schools what ever there they want know use them for even other things beacuse you want know your students are sad what they are feeling like day day bases since some kids dont really tell you whats going with their life and you see them sad crying but they wont tell you what they are feeling like think you can use these think students will find very interesting these computer models beacuse they have computer models that recognize their faces and get every little muscle their face make almost like replica order see the facil expressions you make like when the computer recognises your face shows you like something not like the ads your phone you like shows more like those you just watched but sometimes opinion feel like just wants you stay your phone and klepp being and find kind creepy that knows your face and the way you feel but for the most part teen and other people would like these cool way use just like they tried using mona lisa painting see what she was feeling back then because she looked like she was very mad something but other wise think will great and think they should use them schools find very interesting for many students and myself use think they should allow many schools,3
facial coding valuable not there new emotion reader out there called facs short for the facial action coding system this new application has bunch cool features and innovations that can have some pretty practical applications however this essay only focused one application this system beneficial for reading human emotions classroom setting people have mixed feelings about this but this essay will focus why this new facs not extremely valuable for reading emotional expressions classroom setting first what can this new emotion reader well this thing can read all the emotions the face the mona lisa not just one two but four emotions once and balance the percentages for each emotion let you know exactly how much each emotion the person feeling this could have some really cool applications like being able tell what emotions someone was trying convey drawing being able tell what kinds things you like dislike based off your expressions when you are shown different advertisements there much you can with this new technology and there lot uses that has however the things you can school setting are just mediocre there lot that sounds like cool things you can use this application for school the text says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored the text also says then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this sounds like really good thing however instead computer system having recognize when student gets confused bored the student can just speak and say something about that not all though the computer system could either one misread student expression and make the lesson harder understand take lot longer two the student might just start drifting away and thinking about something else that really confusing like einstein theory relativity the computer turn would make the lesson modified when doesn need and have many modifications that the student gets completely lost and doesn understand anything that happening the lesson just because she started think about something else for couple seconds lastly this facial recognition system could seem like pretty big invasion privacy people want everyone know every single emotion they ever feel they want all their teachers know that they find what they are talking about boring they not least for the most part systems like these are getting pretty close almost being able know what someone thinking and most people don want everyone know what they are thinking about the text says the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements real face the painted face mona lisa weighing the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions this text says that the system can detect your emotions but also your mixed emotions going back the mona lisa example the software can track the exact amount emotions that you have and the percentages the emotions that you are feeling this seems way too much like invasion privacy given that people are giving what their feeling and all too away computer system that can tracked looked anyone now maybe the system will only give what you are feeling teacher maybe will not even that and function one one learning guide even still their are various ways get into computer and technological programs and forcing kids give away all their emotions just for possible improved and modified lesson seems like way too much force someone for that amount reward the facs could have numerous practical applications for entertainment purposes and other purposes too however putting use read emotional expressions students classroom isn one them conclusion the use facs classroom isn worth the value that comes out could have better applications elsewhere could glitch out misread emotions could read emotions that the student feeling about something else rather than the classroom and finally application that can read all your expressions and convey them other people pretty huge invasion privacy and forcing people use this program not worth the value slightly modified lesson for each individual the end facs more useful entertainment device rather than having school setting application this technolgy has great value many areas but schooling just isn one them,6
finally got everyone attention the plaza now just let them know everyone can have your attention anybody looking for decent job then please listen used work for two jobs the same time but one day friend came and said wanted become seagoing cowboy well you all might thinking well what tarnation seagoing cowboy well let explain seagoing cowboy person hired the unrra the united nations relief and rehabilitation adminstration more than nations joined this what you will doing taking care horses young cows and mules that are shipped overseas are doing this due world war some countries were left ruins and are low the stock market people please join you guys should join help others you think traveling boat boring you are wrong play games the ship trust these games make the trip even faster all need watch the cows and feed them pretty easy people hope you all want join thighs program becuase just imagine our country was ruins you all know that others will help join now just going say this now this big opportunity interested please let one the cowboys know and once you let know you will become one too,2
how you feel about driverless cars what you think they like for you the future are they better than cars that have personally operated the human well they named few good and few bad things that would come with the driverless car they told how you will still have keep focus the road the driverless car because will need hand driven when comes work roads and accidents that have happened even traffic jams the good things they said about would probably that censored you dont hit nothing tells you when something wrong and where your far and how its driving itself the things that are good about the driverless car would could drive itself you could relax and chill while its taking you where you need also its good because has all these sensors the car that can tell when brake when slow down this could good thing kind when driving itself you should always prepared take over but said the article while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver they ever got into car accident they could probably back and look the cameras too see what the driver was doing and how they crashed the things that are bad could that whenever the car wants down the company could shut your engine off any tme and any place whether its still driverless not you still have pay attention you might well just stick with the divers car the other bad thing could your car can decide when brake and that could any point and you could brake the wrong time and someone could hit you one bad thing that could also good the sensors sometimes they could out and your car could start messing opinion think driver cars are better because there much that could wrong with the driverless car like the car going out and the sensors messing and you just break down and you wouldnt know how else fix because has much technology but with driver cars you can know when there problem you know when and where you need fix things under the hood the car general the driver cars are better hinky because the person the car should always have their eyes the road have driverless cars what was the point the drivers licence and permit the cars will drive you know with drivers car where you have person driving you know how operate the car you know how change the oil how change the breaks they dont out and you get wreck mean yeah you could something wrong with the car and mess but sure you working car you have done before but drivers cars you dont have worry about the engine reducing power you you just fill the car with gas and your good but driver cars you got ta worry about the car breaking down etc but there are always fix your broken down car unlike you can with driverless cars had choose any car whether was drivers driverless think would with the drivers car because for the fact know could trust the car and could have the car checked see its good for running and driving unlike you could with the driverless car the driverless car could good for long then something bad could happen and you not know what was wrong with had get car choice between drivers and driverless would most definitely choose drivers,3
what you think the face mars natural landform made aliens most people think the called face mars formed aliens believe otherwise because landforms earth are like that and these assumptions are made conspiracy theorist not nasa officals now here are reasons the face mars made natural landforms and not aliens one thing evidence picture mars global surveyor paragraph says anxious web surfers waiting when the image first appeared the jpl web site revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all that big piece evidence that not made aliens also second piece evidence that supports that the face mars not made aliens paragraph what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the amerian west reminds most the middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars that first reason believe that the face mars landform made the fact that conspiracy theorist make the assumption the face mars made aliens you have understand that those remakes are not all true they are just theories which just provided evidence but not always right paragraph says some people think the face bona fide evidence like mars evidenced that nasa woud rather hide say conspiracy theorists meanwhile defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars that evidence was never what nasa said that conspiracy theorist said and not true mark these words and think about your decision think you should change you mind about the alien theory natural landform with this information the unmasking the face mars from the evidence that landform instead aliens making these faces mars don always what the internet media says what real experts say maybe you people that think that made aliens hope reasonings and evidence strong enough change you mind now what you think evidence did change your mind,4
the advantages not driving car outweigh the disadvantages cities start give options for transportation like buses terminals and taxi worth driving and spending money gas driving produces carbon dioxide which bad for the air some cities have banned cars for day even banned cars forever the city vauban germany the residents have decided give their cars the city provides transportation with buses but most thew stores places work have been placed walking distance result people started ride bikes more which pollution free way transportation the united states the enviromental protection agency promoting car reduced communities and experts believe public transportation serving suburbs will play major role its horrible when there much pollution you have ban driving for day paris they had ban driving because there was much smog that they had clear inthe air result the smog was clear just after one day just because half the city paris didnt drive the city bogota colombia they ban driving one day every year promote alternative transportation and reduce smog the people bogota like the idea using alternative transportation because relieves the stress driving but for the first time two other cities decided that they wanted participate maybe one day the whole world will participate the idea not driving might shock some but not driving only has positive outcomes towards the enviroment and the only people that would suffer would car companies what the world stopped driving for the day how would the planet affected,3
after reading the article called making mona lisa smile and about how there machine that can actually read peoples emotions and put their emotions into percentages and how they used find out how the mona lisa was fehling when she was painted think that truly amazing think that should use this technology school read the students emotions think its great idea use for school teachers can tell how the student feeling and can find way help them paragraph the author uses the example how could use this new technology during school for example wrote you smile when web appears you screen similar might follow but you frown next might different and instead ads they could explanations how problem think that that would improve the students learning conclusion think that should use this new techonology our avantage and use the classrooms can tell which students need help and which one doesn that way can help them they might even learn even more,2
here tell you that the face mars not the face martian but there always both sides situation like this scientist and there are some explanation why this face exsitu both sides side that the face mars could seen wrong could pile rocks and there many wierd things this planet with weird shapes cant always martians aliens start this off could alien but there strong possibility that its not either first the face way largo actual face say the artifical the measured meters thats almost impossible also says the artifical that the face mars was just illusion caused the shadowing the rocks make look like face you look furter into the artifical says that everytime they went across the planet that looked exactly the same real debate whether the face real not there also strong evidence both sides but nasa has alot proof that isn alien they could hiding they can wrong,2
reading someones facial expression may effective sometimes but that does not mean that they are actually feeling certain emotion like anger and confusion for example but they could feeling extremely happy the article the author stated that huang used picture mona lisa test the new emotion recognition software but the software may not effective because they tested painted photo and not real living person also vinci could have exaggerated mona lisas facial expression for the sake the painting they may not accurate using this software classroom may not effective because student making certain face that does not mean that they are bored confused could just how their face naturally looks the software can also mis read their face and even glitch the use this program would require the use camera through the computer and that not always safe hackers could trying hack their computer and steal personal information from the person even their identity conclusion this software not valuable for classroom use because students have other things that they need other then facial coding system the student knows that the camera active then that could even become distraction them they use this software not needed,3
should venus even with its dangers humans could find out many things there might animal life even oceans with life could learn what the ground texture like even learn abut the gases that are the planet find life venus would prove that their are other life out there there could life under the ground but wouldn know that cause cant even get the surface the plant there life the plant could learn how they world watching maybe even with pictures with oceans could find there are organisms would prove that there different kind life the planet with learning about the ground could see what minerals holds its the same kind have earth there are ones dont even know could grow plants the soil there are plants growing under the ground there could worm like creatures even caves who knows how big the caves could what could now with getting venus would need ship rover that could with stand the pressure the plant one that could maybe could under ground and have something stick out from the ground every once awhile maybe even one that could stay the water the plant can build ship that can with stand all venues wearer than could study freely this why think should venus make ship venus with venus could learn many things find minerals dont have earth maybe even find more similarities between are planets,3
scientists made discovery cydonia region the red planet nasa viking was snapping photos the area looking for sites for its sister ship viking while began take pictures the region spotted human like face many believe alien monument many believe natural landform has been proven that the face natural landform but not everyone seems agree what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent buttle mesa which are common landforms around the american west also there are scientific facts that aliens are real conspiracy theories lack creditability they question nasa and conspiracy theorists believe that nasa trying hide something from them meanwhile defenders the nasa budget with there was ancient civilization mars they photographed the face soon they could get good shot april mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera snapped picture ten times shaper than the viking photos there was alien monument only natural landform finally they gave after eighteen long years investigation many researchers gave the face many natural landforms disappear over time which why scientists and researchers can longer find although some researchers are still the look out for the face hoping find again soon,3
the author presents the idea exploring venus well but what about walking the surface explore from the space craft could walk the planet without being harmed all the outside forces then coul run more tests the passage the author states each mission venus was unmanned because none the spacecrafts have survived landing these factors show that with the materials have should going for safer planet like the moon mars the author also states that the planet atmosphere percent carbon dioxide with highly corrosive clouds this shows that most metals have can melted the clouds and the temperature the surface too much for human handle like said the intro had the materials keep human safe walk the planet and take samples would have plenty things test here earth venus also has the hottest surface temperature the solar system could find way keep the hot air out and the cool air could conclusion scientists should not looking into trying land venus there are too many risk factors take and don have the resources,2
the use technology that able read the emotional expressions students classroom would very valuable there would number benefits there was such technology available this technology would not only benefit the students more ways than one schools had technology that could read the faces students and modify the lessons would increase the students chances success the article huang claims classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor the lesson was altered improve the facial expression the student there huge chance that the student will become more engaged the lesson resulting success when student bored lesson more than likely the student will not pay much attention well they would they were truly interested confusion may cause frustration which would lead more difficult learning process student who actually interested certain lesson has more chance become excited about the lesson making the learning experience more enjoyable and easier learn the article huang says most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication this being said most students will more than likely not verbally express when they dislike certain lesson most would show their unhappiness through facial expressions because teacher may not able fully read students facial expression would more effective computers were available read the expressions and alter the lesson for the student technology that able read the facial expressions student would benefit the student and the teachers the student would more engaged the lesson and the teacher would have better understanding what grabs the attention his her students compared what drives his her students away the new technolgy would make students more confident their skills leading better more successful educational system,4
begin argument want say believe with all the positive values for driverless cars that nothing compares human humans are the smartest animals the planet and that comes with the proof that driverless cars will make errors much more commonly than healthy human would the driver must pay close attention the road she may aswell drive themselves rather than watching vehicle drive quite possibly the vehicles could used for say elderly yet that provides much higher risk possible accidents there purpose the vehicles even they are supposedly driverless due the constant and important attention requirement regardless you must pay attention the road your eyes can not stray off nor complete other activities like being your phone watching movies especially where states that the plan improve the vehicles capabilities and add feature focuses the driver eyes keep them paying attention this defeats the purpose being able relax sleep while the vehicle takes you your destination concluding opinion the entire idea self driving driverless car completely redundant and rhetorical there very dense and hollow purpose for the creation self driving cars other than the fact that people want them there real purpose all other than people being ignorant and lazy opinion stands with driverless cars and refuse agree,3
death box known the driverless car new innovative and futuristic those are some words that average minds would describe the death box with wheels the death box with wheels refers the idea cars that doesn need driver these driverless cars are being developed and are coming the market soon some people will purchase them because they are the fresh new thing absent minded the dangers that will fall upon them for choosing them against the fact that people need driverless cars the world how reliable could these cars actually they rely sensors and laser beams form constantly updating model the car surroundings what one the lasers sensors were malfunction without the passengers knowledge that window opportunity for accident occur imagine yourself riding highway without the care the world your driverless car now that that delightful picture etched into your brain imagine that the car swerves into ditch because kept straight when should have turned this was result two things the lack natural human instinct and faulty sensor the driverless cars can lead the devolution the human race the car basically promoting laziness car that drives self jauss begging humans things that they wouldn normally when they are driving like drinking liquor helping themselves any other drugs when driving regular car the driver can excercise their focus motor and divisional skills when you own driverless car there less opportunity convey and excercise those skills think that driving assisting features the newer cars are okay but going ahead and making car completely driverless insane the article states presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times they are right assume that the cars aren completely safe put your trust all have experienced time our life where technology was unsuccessful malfunctioned the artifical expresses good point the technology fails who fault would you the manufacturer conclusion there are many things deem are wrong with the driverless cars consent people might think them innovative and futuristic but they could end being there demise these cars could become malfunction any time without the passengers awareness since they rely lasers and sensors help the car drive itself sensor could break and leaving the people inside subjective accident really blame the person hurt badly while putting there trust into the car would there fault for ignorant would being the manufactuers fault for selling them death box with fancy cameras,4
was rok for nasa and one workers argued that the face mars was created aliens would argue that just landform the reason say its just landform because dont have any proof that aliens made only looks like face sometimes because the article says formed shadow giving the illusion eyes aliens made why wouldn they just give eyes the fist place instead using shadows people made that aliens created the human face landform nasa didn say anything the public would people wouldn even know about they told the soulis about they can draw attention towards the mars paragraph says the authors reasoned would good way engage publish and attract attention and why would aliens make human face without completing them using shadows eyes but what there were shadows when viking one came round would look like normal hill final thoughts about somebody arguing with that aliens made face would tell them its just hill the only reason wouldn agree with them because they dont have any information support but they had enough claims support what said cab see where coming from you think aliens made the face mars,2
driverless cars are thing the future with many companies working towards driverless cars google toyota bmw mercedes benz audi and nissan think have streets full the time think driverless cars are fantastic idea humans have flaws and machines too but could manufacture car smart enough know how navigate traffic its own and when and where stop humans flaws would not issue have too many distractions our lives and needless say thinking about those things while driving the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone further improvements sensors and computer hardware and software make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more and more driving tasks their own paragraph this indicates that driverless cars are safer than manual ones and that they use less energy with cars sensitive these there would fewer accidents well there are few issues with the case the technology fails and someone injured who faulted driver the manufacturer paragraph the other hand the time driverless cars are the streets should have most legal issues worked out all all think self driving cars are safer than manual ones with many distractions have our lives really not need another thing worrying about,3

dear senator imagine being the year for choosing for new president for the united states america you cast your vote for which president you thought that would best run our country after you hear the results you become very disappointed because the presdient won not the popular vote but the electoral college you become very angry and frustrated because the president that will now running for america will not better our country the things said reasoning that won the electoral college and not popular vote and you feel you dont feel was not fair because you not really choosing based the state laws and how the electors are selected how would you feel you were situation like this furthermore think should change the election popular vote for the president the united states america reasoning being said because when the president wins popular vote from what the american citizens want not what the electors chose when you choose popular vote you also avoided many other things from occuring for example the electoral college method selecting the president that may turn off voters for canidate who has hope carrying for their state explained the text voters presidental elections are people who want express political preference rather than people who think that single vote may decide election moreover the electoral college unfair voters candidates dont spend time states they know they have chance winning and only focusing the states that they said the text campaign seventeen states dont see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didnt get see single campaign making that hard for the people see what there president wants for the country they have idea because the canidate too worried winning and letting the citizens choose elaborate claim the electoral college what might call the disaster factor the disaster factor what happened the fiasco which was the biggest election crisis century which allows the system for much worse the electoral college state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and those electors would effect the will the citizens sometimes faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party canidate and cast deciding vote for whomever thet please making another reason why the electoral college should here stay although keeping the electoral college may not good thing,4

against the development this car few things that don like about that would cost alot money may cause more wrecks then usual and the fact would make even more lazy when don drive first reason why against the development this car because money some places there may not enough money room even consider doing this project also some people won because they want drive feel comfortable driving their own car second may cause many wrecks the car itself may fit and ready but may cause wrecks because weather conditions the car itself can control itself also believe people wouldn trust something like this yes have admit that this car cool but many people will not agree this third would make even more lazy without walking driving ourselves places think should stay with driving ourselves for now until they are sure they ready for this and have enough money for,3

think the development these cars could help with much for the development these driverless cars for three reasons first because they help assist drivers and warn drivers possible problems they could help with preventing car accidents and they also allow the driver still have control over their vehicles these driverless cars allow drivers drive easy without worry because they warn the driver any possible accidents these cars would very helpful many aspects for example the traffic jam assistant announced bmw can steer accelerate and brake themselves and notify the driver when the road ahead might require human skills such navigating through work zones around accidents secondly the use these driverless cars could help prevent lot car accidents the traffic jam assistant can also handle driving functions speeds mph but its touch sensors make sure the drivers hands are always the wheel also has developed seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object lastly these driverless cars are good use because they can still allow the driver control the vehicle the driver decides they want drive themselves the driver would just have more security having driverless car conclusion think having driverless cars would benefit people lot developing these cars good idea because these smart cars driverless cars help assist drivers and insure security they could also prevent car accidents and they still allow drivers control their vehicle these are the reasons why support the development these cars,3

should keep the electoral college because when you vote for your canidate the presidential election you are actually voting for his her electors also because electors can anyone not holdin the public office finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same canidate over percent todays voters would prefer more direct way electing our officials than how are electing them now did you know that when you vote for the canidate that you want elected into office you are not only voting for that canidate you are actually voting for that candidates electors under the electoral college system voters dont vote for the president but vote for slate electors which turn elect the canidate voted for say that you voted for obama last years election you didnt actually vote for obama you voted for his electors vote for turn you voting for them many people see this fine but say that your candidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down road betrayal this one important reason for the electoral party disbanded electors that represent canidate the presidential run can anyone not holding public office who chooses for these electors not the voters course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard seen any flyers ads that state chooses their officials from state conventions and even sometimes the state partys committee the president has his own party electors for himself which would way cheating having your own officials vote for you what the electoral party you voted for vote for specific canidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for different canidate the election you cant always control the electors stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group voters who voted for canidate would actually vote for the canidate that they actually want win thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need form party and change their vortec mid election should not not keep the electoral college because all the flaws and the deceiving image holds because you not vote for the canidate you vote for the electoral party member representing that canidate that the canidate can anyone chosen the state and you cant always control that the member the electoral college that you voted for vot for different canidate that the ended voting for during the election this why dont need the electoral college help vote for the presidents should have more direct way voting,4

driverless cars can very dangerous the reasoning make these cars kind crazy think about waking the morning knowing that you don have drive all the way work sounds pretty good right but there are some downsides that come affect when conceding getting one such the accidents they could cause the money takes make fix and buy and the history driverless cars such what companies that made them far and they have been succesfully not one the main reasons that driverless cares shouldn made anymore the risk accidents that where the technology kicks into play like passage states without the option smarter roads manufacturers turned smarter cars but how much smarter did the cars need this first question that comes mind when thinking about these cars there way that these cars become smart thier own which causes accidents occur such the car taking over the sterling from the driver when driving its self going know when brake not the biggest reason why driverless cars should not made the money this car could not affordable our world today with all the upgrades and new technology plus would way more money get smart car fixed then would buy one but the big factor the money issue would making them and how much would put all that technology and software the cars and all the body work and sensors would just way much money for the ordinary man afford last but one the key factors into why this driverless car should not made anymore the history these vilches passage states best many futurists believed the key developing self driving cars someday wasn much smarter cars smarter roads this why when manufacturers google who made the first smart car said that would nearly impossible make anymore smart cars unless there something done the roads all these reasons are just few why the production these driverless smart cars should stop they would not help the world much they think they would,4

throughout this article learn new technology called the facial action coding system this system used identify human emotions now the real question this technology valuable the students classroom the use this technology read the emotional expressions students valuable the classroom begin with classroom computer could recognize the students emotions classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor the motherland the software might not great throughout the text the scientists state that the emotions are universal and that everyone has the same few emotions eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness the facial expressions for each emotion are universal observes chaung what the machine predicts reads the expression wrong than what not everybody expressions are the same some may vary and with only six basic emotions the machine may not able properly read what person feeling summary have come the conclusion that the use this technology read the emotional expressions students very valuable not other can read their emotions but can improve their learning experience their are few things that the machine may not able and small chance error whilst reading emotion but overall the technology valuable students the classroom,3
the development driverless cars will beneficial aspect the world progresses the future the development these cars will ensure the safety the driver passenger and outside pedestrians and drivers this development cars will also make driving less straining for the driver requires careful attention when the road therefore the development driverless cars can supported beneficial aspect revolutionize the world when comes safety and accidents cars tend always involve those factors many daily drivers make the road more dangerous place because they dont have there full attention the road instead are distracted other factors such texting anything thats causes them take their eyes off the road with the development driverless cars they can ensure the guaranteed saftey the driver they will completely immobilized hazardous mistakes according the article the driverless cars are coming the author states that most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety best achieved with alert drivers this case shows that safety only ensured when drivers are alert because not all drivers are alert the real world saftey can guaranteed this safety can guaranteed driverless cars which prime function transport incapable submission outside forces driving previously stated requires plentiful attention the road and your surroundings this however can straining the driver due being restrained look the road for long period time and hands becoming sore from grasping the steering wheel driverless cars can relieve the burden that due them having control driving themselves the driver can instead relax entertain himself and sleep exhausted from busy day the article the author states that entertainment information systems can turned off when the driver needs take over implying that the driver only needs engaged when necessary rather than the time conclusion the development driverless cars can seen great innovation the safety the world and drivers among people will longer need feel the heavy burden ensuring remain alert when not fully engaged the tense suffering driving over period time the development driverless cars will indeed positive aspect drivers global,4
venus very easy for one see for earth you probably seen before but thought was star thats why venus known the evening star even though its planet venus also known the sister planet earths venus also the hottest planet our solar system even though venus hotter than earth expected that one point venus used mostly made water they have made missions venus and with the little outage that they get the short period time the the robot can survive venus they can say that try the venus was once made mostly water just like earth this what makes venus worth studying have yet find planet that one day could have look just like ours there clear evidence that venus once has water its surface and you can tell because the mountains that have been made and the crayons that look just like ours here earth with that being said think that they should keep studying venus and fining more stuff out about crazy think that there was once planet out there that looks like ours does today for people that line work know for fact that this kind discoveries why they there job and why they are the first place even just small victory like venus gives all hope that maybe aren lone,3
the text the challenge exploring venus the author tells the reader allot about venus from the temperature how close earth thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid this shows that the author supporting his text with facts giving the reader idea what venus like humans have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite its proximity this paragraph the author lets the reader know that there has been scientist and astronomers that tried land venus but they weren successfully because the dangers venus also shows that because the scientist couldnt this wanted them want even more,1
ever since humans have discovered space and the existence other planets the belief that are not alone the universe has been back and forth question over the years has inspired many works and become huge part pop culture while this can fun think about sometimes people who can accept the truth take too far the face mars just natural landform because technology wasn that good people especially conspiracy theorists take can take things like this too far and the formation just like others mars and even earth the original photo the face mars was taken way back nasa viking the spacecraft was only trying find landing spots for another nasa ship viking when the picture was snapped technology has evolved vastly over the past few decades but was right the start this kind space exploration technology with the moon landing only happening years prior this event when the latest photo the face was snapped its resolution was times sharper than the viking photo showed every crack and bump the surface the face while the viking only showed patches white while most was covered shadow even mars global surveyor photo from which was taken with better technology than the viking revealed mesa formation the photos taken after the original definitely show anything but face which shows that the face mars was only seen because developing technology the time everytime there statement made organized group like nasa government any kind people like try disprove these statements and say that they are fake these people are called conspiracy theorists they usually jump conclusions statements like this all the time with little evidence back the and the space race had started causing many people believe that are not alone this universe ours anytime there was trace alien life out there radios would broadcast about new channels would cover and sometimes even movies were made about these just like the case the face mars since these are people main sources for news they believed the claims instantly when nasa revealed picture supposed face mars the population went crazy this was solid proof ancient alien life another planet the conspiracists believed but alas the only reason this face appeared was due technology with not enough resolution snap high quality picture the formation conspiracists claimed that alien life mars would something that nasa would want hide but response this defenders the nasa budget said that they wished there was ancient civilization mars the face was actually alien nasa never would have come out and told the public its existence least would said that was alien its reveal instead that caption read huge rock formation which resembles human head this shows that nasa directly knew that the formation was natural and most definitely not alien the face mars was quite the phenomenon which started out the belief that there was alien life out space and also the planets near earth when scientists first saw the formation from the viking they were suprised see face the screen but that was only first scientists quickly realized that the face was nothing more than martian mesa these mesas are very common around cydonia the region mars which the photo was taken these formations are also other parts mars and even here earth jim garvin cheif scientist for nasa mars exploration program stated reminds most the middle buttle the snake river idaho this shows that formation like mesa super easy indentify and one mars could just easily identified with good enough technology proven the mars global survey spacecraft and the mars global surveyor from which was even taken through clouds the red planet makes sense for the formation mesa especially since the fact that there were other spacelike structures like this found mars since the face mars natural landform because the technolgy that took the photo wasn that great compared years after conspiracy theorists can really blow things like this the wong direction and the formation the face resembles structures like that mars and earth with our knowledge and exploration space growing every day just matter time until discover alien life somewhere the problem people can get caught these kind things and overeager them beyond reasoning technology has advanced much the past few years much that can see every crack and divito the surface planet the question when will actually discover real face mars,6
venus our second closest planet the sun but not know what venus actually looks like like paragraph venus could have been once like earth could have been filled with oceans plants trees and even mountains could anything just like earth but don know yes would nice explore venus but what risks will have paragraph states nasa has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans study venus they are wanting study see what has yes venus one the hottest planets more than mercury and yet are wanting risk searching and seeing what venus actually looks like venus can also melt any kind metal yet want risk because our curiosity paragraph saying that once ago venus had better electronics but actually know they were more advanced then our technology now days feel that the need and the curiosity that humans have could take success could take failures,1
many countries and cities have cut down the usage cars because the pollution that they cause some countries created days dedicated not driving cars and someone violated this they would fined some people accepted this and embraced while others did not like the idea not being able drive all that was why when paris forced driving ban almost drivers were fined according the article paris bans driving due smog robert duffer they did this because they are the city europe with the most pollution but actually not driving has many advantages that help you and your city one advantage not driving that reduces lot stress and also helps clear all the traffic off the streets many places are trying make things closer together and easier get encourage walking over driving andrew selsky mentioned his article car free day spinning into big hit bogota also mentioned that parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced broad smooth sidewalks this has caused the people bogota colombia love walking matter the weather the article the end car culture elisabeth rosenthal she mentions that america love cars has decreased lot she also has stated that study last year found that driving young people decreased percent between and people are now car pulling walking car sales have decreased well some cities like vauban germany have cut car usage all together and are completely car free mentioned the article german suburb life goes without cars elisabeth rosenthal conclusion there are far more advantages not taking car then there are disadvantages important cut back the usage cars cut back pollution the world many countries have already done which has only been very beneficial for them people are happier and less stressed out the air clean harmful fumes which why beneficial for more countries and cities cut back the use cars people can more happy and healthy,2
limiting car use could good thing producing greener cars that find alternative fuel rather than burning fossil fuels the american society built around cars and cars have only been around for hundred years have not been interested changing what they run maybe could find cleaner burning fuel source that dont have cut cars completely out our lifes alternative means like electric cars and cars that run solar power are out there are just not mass producing them the cars that are out and that run alternative means fuel are expensive for the average american oil companies dont want see this switch happen cars that run alternative fuel because then that cuts into their budget there are cities that have cut cars out their society completely like vauban germany were they are almost completely car free you can still own car there you just have pay for parking space which deters most people from owning car percent the population vauban not own cars result making the air their city alot cleaner than their neighbors cities like paris and beijing china have some the worst pollution records than any other city the world paris got bad that they had nforce driving ban just let clear cities like these have alot residents which means they have alot cars offering free transportation some days might intime peple leave their car home and help lesion the rate pollution that given off their are alternatives for now like car pooling and public transportation but the population keeps growing are going have find another means getting around greener once plug and hybrid cars become cheaper there will more them found the road but for now can try and cut back our car use help the enviroment more places become more populated the pollution only going increase america however the main source pollution not coming from cars coming from factories which burn fossil fuels and blow them right into the atmosphere need not just focus cars need also focus factories and trying find alternative fuel that can power them cant just cut cars out our life but maybe can cut back our use them our society just can leave better world for generations come alternative fuel the answer just have start producing cleaner burning cars and more efficent factories,3
techonology called the oficial action coding system enables computer identify human emotions really good thing would like know they are lying about their emotional huang really smart but think right first computer identify human emotions really good thing because would know they are lying acording the text can actually calculate emotions like math homework think they got the right point because our emotional like calculate they have calculate are really sad happy another example from the text the mona lisa demonstration really intended bring smile your face while shows just how much this computer can hope our school should like that people could help other people whenever are sad second these day lot people they are lying another people much honestly used cheat girlfriend too back the day but the good part that don know facial action yet both know that time bet she will say let this because want you are cheating still right now she don know that cheat her but are already broke tho saw social media lot boyfriend and girlfriend did that when they know they both got cheating both them feel wierd people really good hide thing hope are did facial action could know how lying nah finally think huang really smart doing those kind thing the software the latest innovation from prof thomas huang the beckman institute for advanced science the university illinois some day want like him idol from now also someone ask who would want meet right now would say want meet with huang conclusion every year different technology coming out can imagine what going like year later what kind technology would going out,2
cars are part everyday life you use them drive school work out eat the movies with all your friends but what you didn have cars what you weren allowed use them many places around the world like europe colombia paris and even some parts the united states have started end the car culture this has proven very beneficial keeping the earth clean safe and and healthy greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes cars have been big culprit pollution paragraph the article german suburb life goes without cars states cars are responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions europe and widely used car areas the united states paris they reinforced partial driving ban clear their air after near record breaking days pollution paris has more smog than other european capitals having had micrograms particulate matter per cubic meter which compared other paces like london who only that lot smog with limited driving the pollution will decrease and benefit the environment over time not only does the limited use cars increase the overall health and safety earth helps keep safe too multiple car accidents happen every single day around the world you would know without cars there would car accidents accidents such these can caused traffic when driving the highway with cars surrounding you all going mph there high risk getting into accident during france partial ban cars the congestion car traffic was down than normal this lessened the chance accidents and made the roads more safe for both drivers passangers and those walking along the streets since cars would longer use how would you get around columbia many citizens hiked biked skated took buses work during their car free day without the use cars americans and others would actually get and move get where they need which isnt something that common anymore america the most obese country the world with most the top obese cities residing texas cars give another excuse not active our everday lives everyone had limited use cars everyone whole may get the daily exercise they need say healthy state although cars are useful get the places need fast they are not required needed they let off gases that are harmful our environment can hazardous ourselves and others and should replaced play against obesity and wellness the cons cars outweigh the pros and everyone should turning off their cars and stepping outside,4
the author evaluating how explore venus because the most familiar planet earth but the air about trying some reasearch the planet venus because they have sent aircrafts the planet before but none them have been able touch down venus first scientist have thought the planet venus was covered large oceans one point time and could support various life forms the planet the text says venus has big gas ring around the atmosphere this showing that makes harder for nasa land venus because the gas that surrounds the planet next nasa has thought about sending aircraft venus but they have ran into some problems the way one the problems they have ran into that they cant get close enough the planet get any samples even see whats the ground the text says thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close the sea level earth this showing that none the equipment that nasa has strong enough get close venus conclusion nasa has not been able find way get close enough venus any work get any samples the planet but they are working making metal strong enought last long period time left the planet,3

driverless cars are excellent idea the article says that the cars would use half the fuel today taxis and would offer far more flexibility than bus there are many complications when comes driving any type car you hear lot about car accidents deaths injuries and much more what they are trying create safer car think this great thing because would using less fuel the driver would more focused and will make driving safer everyday through much fuel get around are hurting the enviroment tremendously and something needs done about seems that would also cheaper drive smart car depend cars more than anything get around why not make something that saves money people would feel ease while driving too however driverless cars are not completely driverless these cars can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all the cars are designed notify the driver when the road requires human skills this will definately keep people aware whats going around them new drivers espcially the smart car will keep you alert all times which most normal cars lack today after while people get used driving that they not pay attention this makes the road dangerous place has created sensor let you know when the vehicle danger backing into object the seat will vidarte and the google car will announce the driver take over manufacturers are considering using cameras watch the drivers see they are doing what they are supposed werner huber bmw project manager driver says have interpret driving new fun way some manufacturers hope bring information systems that use heads displays this way the car system safer and safety big concern another safety feature special sensor that makes the driver keep hold the wheel with many manufacturers working improve these cars and help make them safe will turn out huge step the world smart cars have come long way automakers are continuing their work the assumption that the problems ahead will solved manufacturers believe that more states will follow soon the cars are proved more reliably safe amazing how can make technology and even better when has positive outcome they should definately continue improving these cars because less fuel usage drivers would more focused and alert and will make driving safer and easier they are still growing with ideas they are getting closer and closer their destination each day,4
years ago when cars were first being developed the idea that one would able practically drive itself probably would been thought crazy cars themselves are such grand example technological wonder that one being able handle major tasks its own just seems like too much however here are and the concept driverless cars being produced mass and becoming new normal real possibility possibility that the realm safety and advancement promising the concept driverless cars nothing but good idea the safety that these cars could create the road enough people used them could huge for the prevention car crashes the future maybe even bringing world which the horrors such accidents longer happen all efforts google and other companies make such scenario possible are close enough now make look could really happen but they aren quite there yet there still work done but the progress made far points bright future the world automotive technology and road safety right now concept models driverless cars aren exactly driverless they need yet efforts the likes bmw traffic jam assistant assume lot the driving workload but can handle everything that human driver can driverless car technology right now sort driving crutch for people can get the job done but you have put some effort yourself get the full results driverless car technology right now more like advanced assistance than anything which still good thing but isn enough humans still have too much involvement the process really able deem this cars driverless however these measures towards true driverless technology are still positive ones the name safety there really isn anything wrong with them just that there needs more things like suggested heads displays and vibrating driver seats are helpful but they still involve the driver too much for really make much practical sense the long run the end result real driverless car guess you can climb tree without first starting base though can bash this advancements too much because all all they are just that advancements towards much bigger future goal look these advancements stepping stones the eventual goal totally driverless road experience another thing consider when looking the issue driverless cars the lawful implications involved with them someone behind the wheel one these driverless cars were get into crash who would fault agree with the writer this article that there clear cut issue here currently however think with further advancement this technology crashes would thing the past regardless these issues wouldn even pop more states need give this technology chance rather than just outright banning its practice that companies can work out the kinks that the issues this practice being banned over would eventually non issues anyways give these companies enough time and this whole who would fault thing would never need come again they got their way with further investment into these driverless projects all things considered don think that there issue these companies couldn solve regarding possible safety lawful issues regarding driverless cars they were just given enough time and resources work with realize that these cars aren actually driverless yet the grand scheme things and realize that their current state they could bring issues liability the law but with enough time both these things are simply obstacles that could toppled with new technology these companies involved the creation driverless cars are doing what they doing for the betterment driver safety and striving for the safest driving experience possible think society owe them give them fair amount time complete this goal its entirety what are seeing now just peak what sure coming out this driverless technology research and excited for the future this field study and hope that maybe the time thoughts first car purchase come around could driverless one know that the instance safety that really nice,5
bam knowing that you crashed your new driverless car due technical failure must suck driverless cars should dream not goal against the development these cars its dangerous these cars require lots attention because you never know your car could crash any time the main reason why against driverless cars because the danger could cause technology always fails one point life and using cars could cost life said paragraph the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer driverless cars requires lots attention even though they driverless these cars arent smart enough recognize signs advanced problems paragraph states why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive driverless cars coming soon what before even thinking about driverless cars think about the money will cost upgrade roads these cars will not work off road unless they want put more more these extras roads paragraph says but they require massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply too expensive practical building these car will also require lots money bild and buy thinking getting driverless car your near future don think risk yourself and your money you want situation life death driverless cars should dream not goal strongly against the development these cars,3
the world growing and growing know are making more cars that could act phones but now someone was actually brave enough come with idea driverless cars think the driverless cars are great idea more efficent and more reliable let explain some the reasons why the reason think very good idea because the model would more safer than the average car today today cars you have worry about gas and you don have one those fancy cars you won know where unless you have really good phone serve went with the driverless cars would more efficent the reason say that the driverless cars would more efficent because the rate cars crashes would down least percent you got ta think about the car already all you have tell the car where you want and wah lah your good were make them the proper way wouldn ven have worry about drinking and driving texting and driving the rate accidents like those would down least percent not percent that when the reliable part comes the reason why say that the driverless car would more reliable because drunk drivers and careless texters this way wouldn have worry about them mean still bad drink and drive text and drive but still keep them off the streets unless the car requires you drive hand then really have problem conclusion make these cars the world would better place wouldn have worry about pollution and stuff like that because the car wouldn have rely gas also would keep the text and drunk drivers off the streets,3
imagine point time the future where there could driverless and flying cars people have always for long time thought that this could maybe never possible google cofounder sergey brin begs differ believes that their may start towards driverless cars sergey brin imagines future where numerous amounts driverless car could form public transport taxi system believes that this could one day become reality driverless car production should still continue over the next several years although driverless cars have drove over miles without crashing there are still setbacks driverless car would still have alert the driver while backing out driveways and navigating themselves through road issues such construction zones and accidents with other drivers driverless car far can drive turn and brake but there are still somethings that the driver would still have although the production driverless cars still just underway there still much more done the future driverless cars may available everyone someday there still long way but are getting closer achieving this everyday,1
don like the idea driverless cars feel like human can should especially when comes things like that like the idea robots would you really want something cleaning for you and taking care older folks and children think they are good idea for the blind and people not going far like since live indiana they would good idea for people indianapolis get from the mall like restuarant something nothing major far like driving from indiana california not good idea just don trust things like that driverless cars are sort good idea they are many pros and cons about the whole thing feel like they are dangerous because they could malfunction and blow something they will drive right into bulding full speed something car really safe general but letting robot like thing drive your car kinda crazy idea another con that they can really drive itself still needs you hold the steering wheel and take control when around accident people working roads feel like they want have driving cars they should just buli car that can drive people instead car that half does another con that they are basically illegal most states except couple would have visit somewhere else experience what crazy technology the world has for now also think they are bad idea because driving are probably going directly their phone hand the steering wheel anything and like says when the car needs you take over will tell you take over but feel like people will just ignore and get into accidents they could have prevented pros are that you can half drive you wouldn have really pay attention anything around you and you could just relax while driving,3
that technology would not help schools because the fact that students are sometimes not happy with how computer ads put teacher can also see how their students are feeling the computer but one flaw about this that what didn work the technology would have have many updates get the system right and make the experience better someone can hack that computer and can watching you the government might trying watch how much schools going paying for these compter maybe around million dollars buying and fixing most schools don have good internet they have bad students that might break these computers and the school student would have pay for the computers schools have now barely even work now why buy computer that most likely not going work better than the computers they already have why take away and putting new going make student happy what they dont like ads all what the point the putting computer that can read people emotions scanning their face and the students are not going get any happier they are going excited about first and then get bored with computers are not good for kids young age they will get addicted being computer won outside and then they are going gain weight and then fat,2
did you know driverless cars are being made right now many people are unaware the creations that will further shape our future many big companies are planning great things companies such google bmw tesla nissan mercedes bens and audi some people are against while others such myself are all for these new cars will have amazing things such dubbed lidar innovated sensors and assistance traffic jams first off dubbed lidar every car would reduce car crashes opinion many lives can saved its special sensor which located the roof the car this sensor spins also constantly updates map all the car surroundings this done laser beams with this sensor the car will aware everything that going around reducing the chances crash into something someone nonetheless sensors have been around for quite some time since the sensors have been improving all around the article driverless cars are coming the author states the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone sensors such those the wheels are called speed sensors they can help manage antilock brakes over time they have improved abundantly sensors can detect rollovers and out control skids but this isn the only improvement yet finally peculiar new invention that was recently added bmw traffic jam assistance everyone faces traffic some time during their week what better idea than create something assist those who deal with traffic most often this feature was added not that long ago but the driver must keep hold the wheel for safety precautions and the car can handle speeds mph its always good aware what invention will next things like mapping dubbed lidar sensors and assistance traffic jam could save everyone lots valuable time many companies are getting board with these innovations will you,3
the development the smart car probably seems like terrific idea car that can drive self mean who wouldnt want car that can drive self when you can just relax the driver seat all though seems like great idea for car drive self there are some down falls with the idea seems perfect but perfect can all wrong the idea car that can have autopilot can drive self isnt bad idea why because lets say your driving another state you dont want drive for number hours all you have just switch autopilot have the car drive self seems like good idea doesnt though seems like great idea from google did google ever stop think about the saftey others did google stop think about safety period feel that the smart car idea development bad idea kind waste time because all that work selling cars making cars going down the drain say that because almost the world population have dreamed about driving car getting car dont know about you guys but the story said that the smart car going have camera the car while its driving self watch the driver see she prepared take the wheel any moment when think about that statement think myself theres gon na camera the car watching see prepared not shouldn just drive the car myself the whole smart car idea yes its great idea but what about getting your permit you license sure driving test wouldnt able use our autopilot park the car the idea the car driving self its actually taking the fun out learning how drive learning how park other things the smart car great idea google but personally feel that they should just keep that idea themself because anybody can get smart car not knowing how drive just turn the autopilot then when its time for the driver actually try drive might end conflict with another pedestrian sources say self that alert defensive driver the best driver because the driver aware traffic did google stop ask the computers were aware probably not they think that the car perfect they probably didnt stop think safety google came with the idea that when the driver should prepared take over the car flashing lights the windshield and other heads displays will appear thats bad idea say that because what the lights appear the dashboard the driver beans take over soon the lights away the driver hits another car pedestrian werner huber said why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive the story also said even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer thats good question say that because what the car does get accident who can the other person blame the driver the car self sure that the other person going blame the driver because the driver should been paying attention despite the car was autopilot not another point mine what the sensors the car out you have idea that the car autopilot doesnt work lets say that the smart car the number one car the world that getting sold everyone going have one what other people feel the same way that the idea the smart car great idea but want stick with driving own the world going stop selling cars that drivers can malfunction their own thats bad idea because not everyone going like the idea the car takes the fun the experience away from driving learning how drive the smart car might great idea for old people because what they drop something the car they might need some type assistance ive came the conclusion that the smart car great idea but dont agree with because just takes the fun out learning how drive seems safe but wouldnt you want driver behind the wheel that alert,3

the developement driverless cars important and significant technological milestone driverless cars are perfect example how well have developed sensory automotive and gps systems they also have extraordinary potential make travel safer and more efficient they could prevent countless deaths injuries because the majority all car accidents are caused human error driverless car would never make decisions out haste excitement instead cars would travel consistantly and safely the developement driverless cars could lead several significant technological advances innovations inspired driverless cars could lead safer more efficient vehicles the same time developing driverless cars could lead significant inventions driverless cars are the solution the biggest cause car accidents human error thousands car accidents are caused result poor impaired judgement cars could drive themselves this problem would effectively eliminated driverless car would never make the decision speed run red light addition being safer alternative human driven vehicles driverless cars could also more efficient driverless cars would never get lost because their advanced gps systems they would also take the fastest and safest routes driverless cars would rarely run out gas because they would alwars aware the nearest gas station and how much gas their tank conclusion driverless cars should fully developed and manufactured for public use because they are safer alternative human driven cars they are more efficient well also because the developement driverless cars would significant technological milestone and they could lead newer better technologies,3
hello everyone and welcome cloud nine news today are going talk about spectacular program called the seagoing cowboys alex your host and this lucy host hey ladies and gentlemen but not the only new person today give for luke very experienced seagoing cowboy the last lucy sentence was hushed the crud cheering and clapping thank you everyone but not that you need cheer for the seagoing cowboys here tell you about what they did for the opportunity was astonishing for small town boy like remember saying first day the cattle boat trips were unbelieveable opportunity for small town boy like true too mean was great thing for thank old friend don resist for going the crud cheered besides the benefit helping people got explore many different places got europe got china even got tour excavated castle not only the opportunity was great but being able travel was amazing the crew was awesome when all the cattle whatever animals had were off played baseball and volleyball where the animals were then did table tennis fencing boxing reading whittling and games pass the time wow maybe should join and the first seagoing cowgirl lucy decided but that really neat luke praised the idea think tell captain about that okay now any questions alex sounded desperate get off the cowgirl idea you with the red shirt lucy called excitedly how long were you the program don remember how long but know that went out sea times luke answered you the blue shirt with the neat sign not question comment going join the program after the boy said that murmurs spread across the room most saying too well there you have the reasons and answers questions about the seagoing cowboys program see you tomorrow night with laundry cleaning women bye luke lucy called before the show ended,2
driverless cars are very efficient and should allowed think driverless cars should allowed because less accidents more safety and better driving that why driverless cars should developed the first reason why driverless cars should developed prevent less accidents the article the text talks about how sensors became more advanced since the evidence from the article states within years those sensors had become more advanced detect and respond the danger out control skids rollovers humans responded fast computer could then would not need develop driverless cars but need them prevent crashes skids and rollovers now second reason more safe develop more driverless cars with computer engineered scanners radars and sensors there would hit and runs vehicular manslaughter roadkill humans can not stop fast computers therefor with the driverless car people would stop running red lights speeding through neighborhoods hitting children playing and the elderly can cross safe and sound computer would also stop you from bumping into stuff paragraph the text claims has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object that second reason why more safe have driverless cars the last reason why prove driverless cars need developed better driving the driverless car would good asset have drive highway expressway the sensors and computer interact prevent accidents the highway google modified toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automative radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor the whole bang for your buck systematic vehicle will prevent traffic jams less accidents equal less construction work and less deaths will accu intriguing reason why need driverless cars developed those are just three reasons why the driverless car needed but pretty sure there more the end the day all about safety proper manufacturing and liability the car has those three things why not promote its development,4
the article driverless cars are coming the author talks mainly about positive outcomes for the new driverless cars you ask would most definitely disagree about this new semi autonomous vehicle they are too expensive they aren fully driverless and they have numerous sensors that aren guaranteed keep you safe first reason would have how expensive this car would they did manage make driverless car you believe that would given the public the car alone would costs somewhere around million dollars not mention the massive upgrades the existing roads stated the passage something that was simply too expensive practical second reason that thay are not fully driverless now let ask you something would you like car that you will have take turns drive with would rather your own think about and according the passage the human driver must remain alert and ready take over whn the situation requires had driverless car would put set destination that can fall asleep and wake when made where going last reason kinds ties with second reason the car said loaded with all sorts sensors which includes one the left real wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor with all these sensors you still aren guaranteed full safety the car also said make model the car surroundings and you still need ready take over the wheel certain situations conclusion even though the passage makes the car seem like the coolest thing the world they are too expensive that aren completely driverless and they have numerous sensors that doesn guarente your safety,3
what you think this discovery that appears face the crust one earth neighboring planets mars scientist nasa have proven with evidence that the supportable face mars not alien made the face that has appeared mars not sign life mars but really just the martian equivalent butte mesa that are common landform earth nasa has conducted three missions the red planet just inspect the giant landform and each time they have came back with the same result thirty nine years ago the face was discovered and was realized just meas twenty one years later nasa launches second mission inspect the face once more michael malin and mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original the results this mission were the same the very first the face natural landform just after that nasa used high quality camera with maximum resolution just reveal that the face was what they had suspected all along the landform they had concluded thirty nine years ago the area where the face was discovered cydonia actually known for having landforms that are similar the one that some believe alien relation there could multiple these landforms that look like huge face but they just haven been discovered yet these landforms are most defiantly mesa because they are the exact same eighth and width the mesas that are found here earth even this hoax that people say that the face sign life that used mars was true nasa would defiantly release the public the reason being because this would huge benefit the space program the findings martian life would amazing hear and would bring much more funding the exploration the planet but this isn the case conclusion after three nasa space missions three similar pictures and the smartest people together they all reach the conclusion that the face mars just natural landform what more evidence could you need millions dollars have been spent just try convince the public that the face was obviously not any kind sign that there life mars the theory very illogical that the face mars something alien martian decent when its just something that you can see here earth the american west,5
the electoral college important process voting the president many citizens believe that should not exist and the president should voted popular vote not that simple without the electoral college the president might not thoughtfully voted the electoral college exists for the congress decide who becomes president and vice president the society live today many the young are voting for who promises stuff that they care about but not the candidate who the most qualified and truthful congress examines all the information and chooses who would represent the united states the best and who would run the country with iron first and improve the nation congress didn use the electoral college system the nation could corrupt the popular vote could only few votes and the other half the nation could get extremly angry and rebel protest this could possible start another civil war keeping the electoral college this would not happen the country votes and that counts little towards the new president otherwise the country satisfied with the electoral college system and used now won get upset who they voted for isnt chosen congress who carefully reviews each candidate chooses who the most qualified and votes depending the population each state the senators and representatives get vote too the electoral college system has been part the united states voting system since the constitution was signed and should stay our main system voting keep this country originally was and true its meaning this the most effective way choosing the best candiate for keeping our nation united and strong,3
cars have been around since the and have been popular ever since although recent years the number cars bought and incenses attained have been dropping car usage has also dropped which good thing because limited car usage people are helping the environment and benefiting themselves cars emit pollutions which harm our health and the environment health passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states cars make large amount the emissions that harm the environment when car usage limited less people drive which turn limits pollution but also the developing world where emissions from increasing number private cars are owned the burgeoning middle class are choking cities again see that cars are polluting our world and caused will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation the second largest source america emissions just behind power plants cars and other transporation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment limited car usage clears the pollution which helps and the environment stay healthy many people are taking new ways transporation due bans and such which are due limits car usage they are taking public transportation walking carpooling and all these methods alternative transportation are beneficial they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk take public transportation car pool with friends better limit car usage because not only are you helping the environment but you also saving money and helping yourself out due the lower amount people who buy cars because limited car usage car cooperations are also changing proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry create cities which pedestrian bicycle private cars commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety the way people live will benefit from lower car usage our lifes will much safer although some people may upset they can drive their cars when they want the long run benefits all the community bans continued passed and people are choosing walk take the bus instead limited car usage continues can see that beneficial and will help our environment the long run limited car usage truely good thing for and will hopefully continue,4
the article driverless cars are coming the author presents both positive and negative aspects driverless cars and that means against the development these cars because there are many negative aspects and not lot positive aspects which mean that the driverless car not that safe some the positive aspects driverless cars are googles cars have driven more than half million miles without crash within years those sensors had become more advanced detect and respond the danger out control skids rollovers the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone some the negative aspects driverless cars are these smart roads systems worked surprisingly well but they required massive upgrades exisiting roads something that was simply too expensive practical the sensors weren there the computers weren there and the mapping wasnt there radar was device hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times result most states illegal even test computer driven cars this why against the development driverless cars because they arent that safe unless they have human driver the driverless cars all times the driverless cars would use half the fuel todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus but the cars would still need human driver have control all times the driverless cars still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents but far google cars arent truly driverless without the option smarter roads manufacturers turned smarter cars but how much smarter did the cars need for starters they needed whole lot sensors googles modified toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial monton sensor the most important bit technology this system the spinning sensor the roof the combination all this input necessary for the driverless car mimic the skill human the wheel further improvements sensors and computer hardware and software make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more and more driving tasks their own costs lot money make driverless cars actually driverless they have spend two hundred million dollars radar that top hill the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel fact none the cars developed far are completely driverless they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents this means the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires,1
new cars that drive their own sounds fun right well think again driverless cars should not used thoughout the world driverless cars are not counted driverless because people will still have take control them while traffic zones and during other occasions not everyone will able afford one these driverless cars people who usually ride taxes buses will longer have that option also cameras were thought put these cars watch divers make sure people are paying attention even though they are not driving insure their safety the driver has take control but that invasion privacy why would you out buy car that driverless when you need still have drive any given time and still have watch the road that defeats the whole purpose having car that drives own the article driverless cars are coming says all are designed notify the driver when the road requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents this means the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires driverless cars become the new car than many people who take the bus and ride taxis will unable have rides their locations anymore especially all other types cars are got rid lot low income families rely taxi train bus even subway cheaper way get around because they can not afford car that means they would walking while higher class people are riding driverless car the argument for supporters driverless cars was the cars would use half the fuel today taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus still does not change the matter that people would still have walk get where they need they can not afford driverless car some people believe that driverless cars will good thing because peak our technology they also think that the driverless cars will able help people stay focused the road just the article says most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety best achieved with alert drivers but that statement not exactly true person put car that drives own they are going get more distracted and choose their phones rather than paying attention their surroundings because driverless car made drive own that why driverless cars should not made even thought created reality they are distraction they not fulfill their purpose and they would end costing way more than they are worth,4
the seagoing cowboys program can convince people because you had luke job you can see the panama canal you can also help people who have been hurt the war the job luke had was take care young cattle horses and mules you would have chance take animals just like luke did you can also apart the military forces and help wounded people you can also see things that you probably never seen before like italy panama canal china takes two weeks cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast the united states and month get china you would also care for the animals during the crossings and will keep you busy when the war was over the towns were leaftoed ruins you will apart off the unrra the united nations relief and rehabiliation administation the animals had fed and watered two three times day bales hay and bags oats had pulled from the lower holds the ship stalls had cleaned working farms little kid can great for preparation for the had work but not for the dangers the sea your job watchman you have check the animals every hour the job makes you aware people other countries and their needs the unrra nations will join together and help the animals and people hurt from the war rohter serve injuries,2
the author supports this idea well because they explain that earth the closest planet relative earth and they explain that would survivable for humans the author also explains that many researchers are working their ideas for machines that would last venus often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too the author explains venus earth twin thirty plus miles miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air presure would close that sea level earth solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable humans the excerpt states venus would survivable but dangerous humans many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus the excerpt explains researchers are trying make easier for humans explore venus this article the author explained that venus our twin planet venus survivable humans and reseachers are working making machines more useful exploring our twin planet venus,2
some people might like the idea driverless cars but against think having driverless car can cause damage person there possibility something going wrong the automobile malfunctioning paragraph one states that the car will offer more flexibility than bus some people might prefer the bus rather than car because they don have deal with the responsibilities even though the car might have human mind that doesn change the fact that damage can occur lastly paragraph states that the car can steer accelerate and brake itself but humans have notified when the road has something that needs the human mind also says how when the road the driver has stay alert but there most likely possiblity the driver losing focus this can cause great damage the car and the human itself,1

the challenge exploring venus paper that sets out support that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents after analyzing the paper prepared make the claim that the author fails she presents vast array information the dangers exploring venus well the challenges doing but forgets almost entirely argue that studying venus still worthy pursuit the majority the essay focuses setbacks not rewards the author begins explaining how spacecraft can not survive venus long and that previous missions have been short for that very reason the pessimistic tone continued paragraph where the author describes the formidable heat pressure geology and weather venus and how such intense conditions would complicate research efforts states thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere paragraphs and possible ways combat these road blocks are discussed left out the conversation the why the author describes nasa efforts ipass venus problems like designing hovering device considering the use mechanical computers but doesn fill readers why such pursuits would even worth the effort the question can but why should not answered say that the author was not successful vouching for reach the planet venus not say that attempts were not made paragraphs and make few attempts telling readers why researching still good idea the author informs readers that venus interest scientists because the most earth like planet our solar system mentioned also that venus sometimes the closest option for planetary visitation making its exploration more economical choice than other planets paragraph the conclusion says striving meet challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors here the author saying that venus should studied because can gather information and humans are curious this not science fact based and not strong because common knowledge not argumentative material addressing why researching venus worthy pursuit supposedly one the focal points the paragraph paper evidence supporting should found more than two places conclusion the challenge supporting venus did not good job supporting the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers fact out the paragraphs talk mostly about what struggle exploration would and the work would require focused more giving the reader facts and figures about why studying venus would difficult nearly impossible even but did not thoroughly explain why such difficulties should worked through why researching venus fruitful and worthwhile endeavor,5
dear senator believe that the electoral college should not changed becuase brings does not bring many problems the government and that affects our states way working changes the way choose how the elections work even though avoids certain things and helps others should not changed the electoral college makes the people basically choose one thing and then have the slate electors choose the president for them and that does not seem fair the source titled the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong said under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president seems unfair have people waste their time voting for this and then have something else make the decision lines the same source states who picks the electors the first place depends the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the state party central committee sometimes sometimes the presidental candidates themselves there freedom speech when comes this some people argue that the electoral college good thing have there favoritism run off elections the source titled defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president states region south northeast etc has enough electoral votes elect president solid regional favorite such romney was the south has incentive campaign heavily those states for gains electoral votes increasing his plurality states that knows will win this that there winning just because one place also that same source line states that there pressure for run off elections when candidate wins majority votes cast that pressure which would greatly complicate the presidental election process reduced the electoral college which invariably produces clear winner can argued that the electoral college method selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has hope carrying their state democrats texas for example republicans california the electoral college way keep things fair these are the reasons why the electoral college should kept helps the elections better and not biased hope you review these reasons sincerely proper name,3
venus sometimes called the evening star one the brightest points light the night sky making simple for even amateur stargazer spot venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too earth venus and mars our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun different speeds each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater then what experience our own planet venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though marbury closer our sun the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans study venus nasa working other approaches studying venus,1
driverless cars are coming the near future there debate for whether not should allow them the public roads people say that driverless cars are perfectly safe and that can save the amount gas used currently lot think that should allow driverless cars because they can reduce the amount driving related accidents car companies are already planning release them public consumers specific times and can reduce the amount gas used driverless cars can reduce the amount car accidents and reckless drivers the driverless cars use sensors makes safe for the drivers sensors are already being used cars for example the toyota prius uses sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror and more sensors the sensors are very advanced they can detect and respond danger faster than human the sensors can tell the car apply brakes with better response time and control than human could possibly sensors are only getting more advanced can only get safer the future and perfectly safe use them driverless cars some people may say that possible that sensor fails work technology can get messed but the chance rare and would cause far less car accidents than human had full control over the wheel the smart cars still allow control from the human and the car alerts the human they and the car are danger something were happen the human could take control and try stop the car still allows people steer accelerate and brake themselves the google car announces when the driver should prepared take over made driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger google has been testing driverless cars since some companies are also considering using cameras watch the drivers make sure that they are alert and paying attention case something happens where the human would need take control there has been over half million miles them and crashes far perfectly safe the consumer use the driverless cars can also used reduce the amount gas used today lot google cofounder sergey brin said that the cars foresees would use half the fuel today taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus people spend lot money gas and expensive can reduce that amount half then people can use that money they saving more important things and can possibly improve our economy companies are already planning for the future car companies are making driverless cars and have set dates when they will available consumers tesla has projected release for car capable driving autopilot percent the time mercedes benz audi and nissan plan for the release driverless cars driverless cars are the future and companies have already planned for them they are perfectly safe and they can reduce the amount spending money gas driverless cars can way more than they can bad and the bad worse than what going now should get ready for driverless cars the future,4
the article talks about the pros and cons the driverless cars the article gives people reasons like and dislike the idea driverless cars and like the idea like the idea because its way help our economy grow more advanced and stronger also feel that way will help with reducing our wreck percentage not saying that their won flaws the devices but don give them chance won able figure them out and fix them they won happen again think should embrace these driverless cars and use them our advantage instead not giving them chance and possibly missing out something that can allure our future for the good would really suck missed out something big just because didn like the sound how worked when just change were like and who knows maybe becomes one the best things that ever happens man kind,2
dear senator think would best keep the electoral college process instead changing popular demand the reason why think that because would rather have political experts who study the two candidates based the speeches they give prior election day make the decision who should our president rather than random voters across the united states personally think that keep the whole electoral college process our country will improve lot the other hand were use the popular demand process than voters could discriminate against one candidate and choose the other one top that when you vote for presidential candidate you actually voting for slate candidates even one candidate gets picked over the other their still lot voting left done think the electoral college process would better for the united states whole also think were use the electoral college process would decrease lot arguments and controversy across the united states were use the popular demand process their could easily end being tie where were use the electoral college process they judges could come agreement who won the election entirely also were use the electoral college process their would such thing run off election anymore usually when you use the popular demand process one state might get more attention then another state where electoral college process will treat each and every state equally when using the electoral college process would easier count the votes because you only have many voters where with the popular demand process there would have over million votes counted there are many other reasons why the electoral college should used over the popular demand process shouldn hard for you decide what process should used during the presidential elections that why think the electoral college process should used hope made your decision little easier then was before sincerely proper name,3

the author explains his idea very well saying that worth exploring venus the author persuades the reader into thinking that venus worth exploring because the planet use habitable venus still mystery waiting solved the author also gives scientist solutions every danger venus the author says the planet use earth twin venus use have similar features earth like valleys mountains and craters this why scientist still want explore the hot planet one the solutions exploring venus the authors says blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the roiling venusian landscape the author makes this seem inevitable because said human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors conclusion the author uses and facts and his own opinions explain his idea very well engages the readers into his passage explaining all the cool aspects venus finally supports the idea saying our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,2
can you imagine what would the future like there wasn anymore gasoline for our cars other thing that use for can use gasoline forever with the cars have today there are many different ways that could drive cars without using gasoline the sun isn there for reason going tell why think see cars the future but made different earth does not have life time supply gasoline can dessin cars different ways make them drive think cars should dessin take over sometimes but only times when you need them there are probably car crashes every day because someone has fallin asleep the road texting drunk texting and drinking driving have became big thing these days for people these days instead using gas could use energy for the sun drive car such solar power but just imagine how much those cars would cost would they cost way more tsn the cars today would have have less people the car because what takes smertin amount people expending how much people are the car like said before the sun isn there for reason many things today live off the energy the sun energy believe there are many ways could drive cars the future seen videos where the car was suppose stop its sincere the main two things that think could use keep cars running solar power water the earth covered with water and pretty soon the ice north going start melting and land going start over flowing with water the future this why think will still have cars the future,2
here are the reasons that the face mars not real will tell you why not real know that human has ever lived mars far know that what belive everyone can see the face mars different also varis what each person thinks here have had also weird land forms happen here our own plant sometimes see rockers even here that look like faces but not think they are human face animal face landforms can sometimes surprising how they form they can look was something when really nothing all that what happened mars landform formed and got the shape face but know that mars has not had live people yet course also know that human has gone mars landed their poove face when know not human has lived mars how can say human face when nasa has done alot reasearch that only people have lived earth not any other plant far people also know that aliens not existe landforms can sometimes confuse think something else that does not even excite all but like always nasa well doing more research show people just normal landform that just some people think face but not hopefully this essay has helped you believe that the face mars not face after all all just story that you can either believe media and the people that told you that the real research people that one day will show that just landform but for now some people think something else and other people think other things nasa the people you should believe not the media hopefully have point across this essay the people that think human face see why some people can think face because eat first you can see the face but not face face not face will one day see who right the people that think face the people that not think face also you can see the pictures how the landform changes and was face then probably would not change,3
the years spacecraft snapped photographs for possible sites for the viking land the photo that was taken fairly large head looking object that was nearly miles long was the red planet this caused many people believe what there life mars seems like head but strongly believe just natural landform scientists have proved that the theories the object being sign life was highly unlikely however when comes conspiracy theories people are very stubborn believe them without any proof the scientists figured that was simply mesa which pretty common around there except according the text this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh later the image was unveiled and certainly caught lot attention since caught lot people attention soon starred hollywood film was books magazines and radio talk shows according the text this would obviously cause more people believe sign life mars since went viral but the thing that not evidence life yet many say has not been scientifically proven nasa themsleves have said that just natural landform also movies magazines and books exaggerate things they really aren evidence believe landform just like any other here earth have plenty landforms according the text scientists have said that landforms are very common around there specifically martian mesas coincidentally this landform just happened shaped like head there are plenty landforms and other objects that look like other objects here earth could have rock shaped like heart pond shaped like nose also believe that just the people imagination that leads them believe this sometimes our imaginations and theories can always correct there are plenty conspiracy theories out there believe that you not have solid evidence for such theories don believe them april the object was proven natural landform which proved some scientists wrong about their theories about being alien monument was proven the mars global surveyor which flew over cydonia check the unusual object this proves that there life mars and that the face just natural landform according the text really the martian equivalent mesa butte which are common around the american west this concludes argumentative essay why believe the face just natural landform,4
against the driverless car first most states illegal test driverless car also the car not totally driverless another point the car there are liabilities that have not yet been resolved start illegal test driverless cars most states paragraph nine the text states most states illegal even test computer driven cars that text saying that illegal test the cars much less drive one next the driverless car not totally driverless paragraph seven the text states fact none the cars developed far are completely driverless that portion the text says that car completely driverless that mean that the driverless car not driverless finally the driverless car has liabilities that have not yet been resolved the text states still even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability case accident that shows that there are not even laws protecting person another example from the text states the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer this shows that the car not safe and person could get the blame for accident cased faulty technology one could argue that driverless cars have features that warn the driver when the car has reached point that human has take over the text states has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over would argue that situation where the sound from the google car not expressed not giving the driver the notice could cause serious injuries supporters the car might argue that with tesla projecting the release car capable driving autopilot ninety percent the time the end all the issues are worked out would argue against that claim quoting the text that staes auto makers are continuing their work the assumption the problems ahead will resolved that shows that the problems are not resolved and the auto makers are just assuming that they will worked out conclude there not being laws for testing driver the car not being totally driverless and there being liabilities that are not resolved person should not get driverless car maybe some ime the future automakers will have proof that the driverless car safe but until then people should not drive these cars,3

skirt boom that could you car accident car accidents are really high america and thats terrible many people believe that driverless cars will help reduce accidents they won reduce accidents they will only increase because technology fails alot wont have fast reactions and drives wont see whats going todays technology great but fails alot once they perfect technolgy then maybe they could use driverless car meanwhile they shouldn use think its great idea and decisions that some states wont allow test driverless cars they can hurt someone technology turning off what someone hacks and goes and controls the car people need realize that its bad idea how can driverless car react human would have awake and see whats going car spurns out the car wont stop because wont see and its only focus getting the human the destination point humans rely technology way too much its not safe but usefully dont get wrong the most important thing that driver will trust the car and they will just sit back and relax they wont see whats going because they trust the driverless car what your running late and the car goes only its speed limit you wont make your job the lave you need thats why driverless cars shouldn used until technology perfected they are many reasons why shouldn allow driverless cars believe shouldn allow them until they are perfected until then shouldn using them there also good things about driverless cars like using only half fuel regular car uses but they still aren safe,3
are driverless cars the future death many when people invision the future some may imagine holograms and flying cars today world numerous people are thinking ways better our future for example sergey brin invision driverless cars and how they might function there are many pros and cons this equation one may think that their life isn their own hands they may think they don have contol the car there may devastating glitches malfunctions there may many risks such glitches but there are various benefits for example the text says allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone this shows that the machines work correctly then they would decrease lot the everyday yearending the downfall about that there glitch the system and someone the highway and you stop dead the middle traffic and could potentially die although one may depend that car glitch may the reason someone died numerous people count their phones help them out the hassles everyday life but would one really willing put their lives into the hands machine when riding with new driver one may tend weary the new driver because they have experience much knowlege simply because new learning experience for them growing some may have had undergo trust exercise were one would fall back onto someone elses arms without looking see they catch them having machine driving you exactly like that exercise unless this case instead falling the floor one may die trust major role having driverless car because there telling what will happen for example smart phones glitch constantly and they not holding someones life their hands imagine driverless car had glitch and imagine the devastation there are many variables but having machine control the car isn the way conclude driverless cars would play huge role into the future and when most people think the future they think flying cars and teleporters saftey should come before everything and important recognize that someone life isn their own hands they not control the car and machines always have glitches one may say that driverless cars are unsafe and unreliable and they correct,3
imagine being convinced that completing certain task worth any struggles along the way and you end severely hurt because that exactly what the author this article trying the article the challenge exploring venus the author does poor job supporting the idea that studying planet dangerous venus worth studying venus terrible idea because technology isn advanced enough would take years discover anything beneficial and the costs this both money and lives are outrageous technology throughout the world has improved since the however has improved earth and regards earthly tasks when talking about something dangerous exploring another planet easy see that our earth bound technology simply can not the job paragraph the article the author describes idea that was thought the national aeronautics and space administation this idea have humans miles above venus for exploration the author claims how this would beneficial keeping humans safe from the venusian landscape however the author does not support this idea well goes say how not much exploration can done from there and the conditions would still extremely dangerous but survivable also paragraph the author explains how nasa working other approaches study venus explains how they are working some simplified electronics made silicon carbide that have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface this may sound like good thing but far from one this because the author finishes saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks computer can withstand venus conditions longer than three weeks very doubtful that human can this proves point that our technology far too advanced for such task like exploring another planet therefore supporting claim that the author did poor job supporting this idea exploring unmarked territory isn something that can done over night unmarked territory exactly what venus even technology did evolve enough that humans could visit this planet would takes years decades even centuries accomplish the article the author continously offers alternatives for exploration does this paragraphs and where gives examples organizations that are working towards this exploration however all the paragraphs the author seems only giving what scenarios some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined fails provide any real data statistics for these things except when mentions the simplified electronics paragraph even then those devices are only able survive for weeks would still take many years just improve those devices also paragraph the author states many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus this statement very broad and does not key any form information that should lead believe that true these details from the passage prove point the amount years would take well the fact that nobody has any idea how long the question asked here worth the wait for these reasons stand behind claim that the author supported the idea exploring venus very poorly assuming that the exploration venus does eventually happen one day how much money would into how many lives these are all questions that need considered when brainstorming the idea visiting another planet the author this article avoiding all these mainstream problems simply saying worth the risks when actually not paragraph the author explains all the dangers venus and how they can affect humans explains the planet surface the temperature averages over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet considering that this true can definitely assume that condition venus are severly dangerous and lot people may get hurt trying explore the author also states these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth such environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquefy many metals what the author stating here that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions venus this means that order explore venus have design all new machinery which would cost lot money not mention the human costs would need humans test things out also makes notable that venus has the hottest surface any planet despite not being the closest the sun all these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety well propre functioning machines even exploring venus was possibilty would even worth after all human costs and money costs paid what are discussing here putting human lives risk and spending ton money project that where near being ready ready present these reasons well the provided facts assure claim that the author did terrible job supporting this idea exploration conclusion since our technology isn advanced enough would take far too many years and the human and money costs wuld outrageously high should not explore venus exploring venus proves very dangerous and have proved that are where near being ready for such task would first need advance our technology for the task this would take years due would also use ton money and put people serious danger the author did terrible job supporting the idea that exploring venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents for one there were not enough facts presented the article that were beneficiary the idea also the pros that were present the cons outweighed then tremendously exploring venus proves terrible idea atleast until are actually ready,6

chaung and his colleagues are creators the facs facial action coding system they are from the university illinois the facs system that can detect different emotions from persons facial expressions this system computer and can identify person happy sad and many other emotions the way the system can tell indentify the different muscles used for each facial expression this idea very interesting find that the system has positives and negatives also there nothing out the world right now like think that the facs could very helpful some ways the system can work schools which would help the teachers know who needing help and who isnt understanding the subject can also show what students might feeling like that day and person should trying make their day better the sytem can also help others know when someone could depressed then the person could get the help they need right way and get before late also think this could help with bullying because other students will know that person relating them not the students would maybe understanding one another more knowing that they arent the only ones that are feeling the way they the system also doesnt let people hide their emotions this could good thing and bad thing some people dont like show their emotions and dont trust people enough tell them what going this system could forcing people say whats their mind and they might not want anyone know the other hand might good for them get those feelings out and find help have someone talk the facs still being worked great and unique idea that has more positives that negatives would very successful for many schools all over the country the facal action coding system opinion going help kids teenagers more than adults overall think this would good idea for schools have,3

find the ideas behind the electoral college extremely ridiculous and claim completely justifiable and backed why vote for some one youre actually only voting for board people who could possibly not vote for the canidate your choice there also always chance your canidate winning popular vote and still losing electoral there also the idiotic winner take all system that most states have place this winner take all system means that canidate recieve majority the states votes they get all the votes for that state find irrational because you going vote for board members who may may not vote for the person which you are rooting for why even vote while this possibility extremly low there still always chance may happen the way the voting system set your canidate can win popular vote more than their opponent and still lose lower score electoral vote there have been cases which this happened well gore richard nixon final point against the electoral college the winner take all system states use when comes voting this sytem makes that long there majority state the person that has that majority has all the votes for the state some counterclaims that state that should keep the electoral college enacted state that there will always swing states this means that instead going lots states they the few states that they know could pulled either president over all find the current system voting total disgrace our glorious country its zubair unjust and complete mess believe that should act immediately upon this system and shut dewon soon possible,3

what the first thing you think about when you see car how much gas mileage its has what year how fast can well have you ever thought about how much pollution puts into our air that breathe the car bill you have pay every month going assume you don there are ways can change this problem and going prove how begin this argument going point out that over american people are debt their car bill alone that over our population the you can not tell people are not stressed from this over helming statement when had car was always tense much happier this way said former car owner heidrun walter she now rides bicycles with her two children and now car bill one less thing she has worry about her hectic life another advantage limiting car usage would reduce smog pollution now this not only problem america all over the world paris particularly bad this division paris typically has more smog that other european capitals got horrible they has enforce driving ban ensure all the air was clear the global city even rivaled beijing china which known one the most polluted cities the world after about five days the congestion the streets plummetted down having said that not only car usage bad for our earth could benefit our health from bogota columbia they set program named car free day millions their citizens hiked climbed skated took bus transportation work this day left the streets empty with traffic and the people that did drive had fine rain shine nothing could stop these people from participating this event the city benefited from this much that parks and sport centers have boomed from high demand because people want have healthier lifestyle general one day they hope every city has something similar this day that our wolrd will healthier and even happier therefor clearly obvious the advantages would have limited car usage people would alot healthier not only from the excercise but the air would alot more cleaner breathe also would safer and cut down tremendously deaths might just over the peak driving,4
everyone would like have car that drives them around but wouldn people get annoyed with not being control having driverless cars are cool some way but also can dangor there are positive and negative have the driverless cars they shouldn develop driverless cars because drives still have alert nobody wants wait their turn drive and traffic laws say only safe car when human has full control all times the drivers that are the car still have alert the driverless car alerts the driver take over when pulling and out driveways also when they are dealing with traffic like roadwork accidents the driver has take the wheel those times nobody wants wait for their turn drive driverless cars only let the drivers drive when they are traffic pulling out somewhere wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive most people wont like the car being control and not them some laws are written with the assumption that the only safe about car human has control all times most states illegal even test computer driven cars there are some countrys that limited use semi autonomous cars but the manufactures believe that more states will follow soon they know the cars are safe driverless cars are good for someone people but most people would like control when they drive they shouldn develop the cars only some the people like the cars and will use them they shouldn develop driverless cars because drivers still have alert nobody wants wait their turn and traffic laws say that only safe car when human has full control all times,3

driverless cars would amazing new technology introduce the world the ability simply call taxi and have driverless car pick you and take you wherever you wish whenever you wish will revolutionize the way people get around the technology may its primitive stages now but soon driverless cars can help automate many tasks that are currently being done humans driverless cars will excellent addition the modern world not only does the driverless car make sense practically also has many safety benefits all cars the road are driverless they can communicate much better and have much less risk for accidents unlike with human drivers who can only control the car well the automated cars will directly linked brake systems there need brake the car hydroplaning another emergency occuring the computer system onboard the car can easily and effectively stop the car from spinning out applying specific amounts brake each tire explained section the story another safety measure taken with driverless cars the ability for human take over google driverless car will notify its passengers they need take over the wheel explained section because the task the road too difficult for the car perform assurance the ability for human still control the car very important since even though the computer systems onboard the car may very smart humans have the ability judge most situations better than any computer can one counterargument driverless cars the loss jobs this not stated the article but would issue with driverless cars regardless many people working taxi drivers trash truck drivers freight truck drivers any job involving driving can lose their jobs this problem especially the where there already shortage jobs although driverless cars will bring many benefits the cons them have talked about well driverless cars are scary prospect the thought car driving itself can make many people uneasy done correctly however driverless cars can revolutionize the way that many things today work with companies such tesla mercedes benz audi and nissan planning have fully automated and driverless cars the road and ready driverless cars are just that much closer becoming reality driverless cars would make excellent addition the modern world,4
think that driverless car would waste money dont think that anybody would trust car driving itself around personally think that people would feel safer driving themselves around than computerized car some people may think that car that can drive itself could useful and some ways may could safer because less people could txt and drive drink and drive that could cause less wrecks the down side they cant fix the car when goes through traffic and the person asleep then the car wont know what and could cause another wreck going through one could also cause another wreck was going through construction site that could because construction sites are already buis enough and cramped enough most people would prefer dire them selves work school every day dont trust technology think that has brought our world crap the governemnt misusing just get money and that what these cars are for its just gets civilians money would feel safer because know where going and there crash construction zone know how handle and know where how get where need also wouldnt half worry abut falling asleep and the car not knowing what some one ramming into the back car the safest way that would think have claar that could drive its own have magnets the road and the opposite polarity the car some where that the car has path guide,2
position driverless cars think good idea and bad idea going explain why good idea first then will explain why its bad idea the reason why think its good idea because some drivers can attend responsible for example texting while driving texting and driving the one the most leading killers the united states but now manufacturing companies have the option call and send text people using voice activation now the other reason why think its bad thing have driverless cars because people can use for the wrong reason let explain say guy was driving home from work and decides put the car were has control the driver could fall asleep get distracted his phone and not pay any attention what going around him this could cause many issues especially not paying any attention what doing this could case accidents even death the driver doesnt pay attention now that have explained everything final decison think they shouldn make driverless cars have explained everything why its good thing and bad thing but most say its bad thing,2
the human face mars was not created aliens know that because changes over time and the aliens wouldn know what humans looked like they would have had guess what looked like and another reasons that they did make someone probably would have seen them create they would have like invisible for not catch them making doing something eles that why couldn have been aliens who made aliens were real they would have know what look like and order see they would need get close earth they did get close earth would probably see notice them they could have seen the moon but order that they would either have able see through the glass they would need the spaceship but they are probably more scared than are why the world would they have made sculpture they are more scared than are even aliens did make the face the moon they would have have way making and they probably aren like you see the something probably would have seen them they did make because thay would have had frist have the tool and would have tacke long time shows the pictures that they are still modifying they would have like invisible dodge all our space crafts and rovers and stuff even they still made then they are probably more scared than are them they were scared than why the world would they make sculpture someone they fear and that they know wold hurt them now you know that aliens could have way made that face mars the reasons that aliens couldn have made them are they would have been seen they are too scared they are still modifying they dont know what look like and they may have seen but through spacesuit,2
not agree with driverless cars think robots are too dangerous and could kill they become intelligent enough cars cant replaced not within the next hundred years anytime soon the roads are better controlled humans and would cost ton money make and use all the proper equipment one the major reasons don agree with driverless cars the cost all will quote the article these smart rokas systems works surprisingly well but they required massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply too expensive practical this would put debt even more and will ultimately too risky even this should remain what television sci mystery another reason disagree with driverless cars its good for drive stimulating for your brain you develop more skill driving would one more thing didn have worry about would make lazy thirdly simply too dangerous what the human fell asleep places where the car couldn drive itself the technology fails and the human injured who could take the fault the driver the manufacturer most states illegal even test this sort technology for reason conclusion driverless cars are unsafe too dangerous and could lead the dumbarton humankind not agree with driverless cars and think they should leave the roads for the humans secure robots are unpredictable,3
think would valuable because you could help the kids stay focused and you can make they dont stress over little things you could change your emotions that would great because anytime you were sad something you could just change your emotion because why not rather happy all the time then sad like you having bad day just smile and change experience feel happy when the people apound are happy having bad day just surround myself happy people then will get happier dont feltwell wan na throw something then just smile because probably could have good day just smile its hard deal with emotions and stuff because they dont work out the way you always want emotions are big part though you were emotionless then what would you you would definitely robot this world much has changed like now there are many school shootings and other things like that most people emotions are wack because you dont have solid base work off you gon na get where because you will crumble dont stress just bless this essay may not the greatest but could put smile your fac because apparently emotions are everything,2
the use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable the reason for this that you can tell weather the person really smiling not the computer software facs facial action coding system can classify basic emotions like happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness the passage states that the computer constructs computer model the face all major muscles the model must move like human muscles movement one more muscles called action unit the passage also states that using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements real face the painted face monia lisa can even identify mixed emotions each expression compared against neutral face the computer can tell weather you are happy sad like the passage says that for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then can modify the lesson like effective human instructor the evidence from this passage shows that the use this technology read the emotional expressions students classroom very helpful like stated the claim and passage classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor,2
the new techonology called the facial action coding system facs valuable tool for reading students emotions classrooms elsewhere for many reasons since the system detect and into depth persons emotion accurate results will come out there are multiple ways that this system can help teachers determining how student feels these things such knowing the student confused about topic they are bad mood not the facial action coding system would value for these reasons first off this techology can classify the six main human emotions those which are sadness happiness anger disgust fear and being surprised scientists have used the mona lisa picture way help their research you know leonardo vinci painting mona lisa painting that relays many emotion face the picture are not able tell she smiling not she angry not she happy not and etc the system was able detect the emotions the painting used students teachers will know what student feels when student puts undetectable face furthermore the use hightechnology classrooms will benefit how each student can learn the article states for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this will help students who may having more trouble certain subjects classrooms adjusting their learning style that way the student may able understand more about what they are learning the way they think since teachers can not always detect how students feel about their teaching the facs can help and describe their expressions certain lessons that are being taught another reason why this valued source technology for student because can affect the way classroom atmosphere will everyone happy the class will also happy says the article that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them students put happy face then that will affect how they feel same with having sad mad surprised face with this technology since able detect emotions the facial structure students can change their facial structure that may affect their actual emotion this technology can also prove student lying about something certain muscles the face they are stretched can determine person being truthful not expert faces don lie these muscle clues are sometimes used spot when smiling politician celebrity isn being truthful classroom this technology can used help solve problem occuring class and able figure out the truth not only that most human communication nonverbal incuding emotional communication this technology also great way for nonverbal communication between students when they are not able verbally physically communicate overall the facial action coding system great value techonology used determine students emotional expression can help adjust students learning type help better atmosphere and better person emotion may also help student they are not good mood and may need help from friend teacher but not able say but instead show this technology can help lot for students many those ways,4
how many people you know that would like the moon many sure but why would they want risk their life just see another planet well the author the challenge exploring venus has theory that this exploration very worthy pursuit despite its many visible challenges and dangers the authors first allegation that human curiosity taking over and will lead many finds beyond our planet earth while you may not worry about venus and what looks like every day just think wouldn fascinating there was another hospitable planet besides earth venus was once the most earth like planet our solar system and that statement what makes astronomers intrigued the idea someday going there venus known have surace rocky valleys mountains and craters what would make the mission safe for humans and effective for scientists the author also says although deliberately that humans have the supplies one day explore venus but doesn make the effort the author makes the conclusion that peering venus from ship safely far above isn going cut the words used the author are supported because not only can you not get reliable resources they could ineffective and just waste time instead researchers need take the challenge and work innovations that allow machines last long enough contribute the exploration venus while the author believes there are number dangers the exploration stated that instead feeling like there risk you think them challenges that you will one day overcome now nasa simplifying electronics because modern technology may quick and powerful but becomes delicate aggravating physical conditions such heat overall the author stating that despite dangers presented exploring venus could great investment for the long run next time you are asked what the future could hold for you just think may trip venus,4
dear senator think should take consideration the next few years about changing are election popular vote feel that are state would benefit positive way with the way that popular vote set looking the past history the electoral college not benefiting positive direction quote this from the article over percent voters would peffer direct election with that being said lets look the cons the electoral college begin with the electoral college system the people like dont get vote for president have vote for someone else vote for that feel like vote doesnt count because what happens vote for elector and doesnt for person win that just makes feel dumb then the elector does vote for the same person asme its not really even final becuase that vote doesnt towards the president goes toward the state elector and its basically there choice another con the electoral college system that the same fiasco will break out again were the legislatures are responsible for picking electors and they dont take consideration other people votes the con that could mostly impact america tie the electoral vote another reason the electoral college stupid way vote that the big states get better privileges than the smaller states they out rule the smaller states its final the electoral college unfair outdated irrational the only reasons the electoral college alive now the certainty outcome overstates president swing states runoff elections run off elections means basically there will never blow out the voting polls will always competitive with that being said with the presidents trying run for president the will actually try reach the peoples needs meet there satisfactory the swing states saying that there one state isnt going decide the whole election,3
would type the more thorough answer but being timed prevents from doing that make quick the main advantage noticed the decrease air pollution being able produce smog across entire city like paris impressive alone but after reading paragraph source paris typically has more smog than other european capitals not all too surprised another thing not surprised about are french delivery companies whining about not getting paid enough during the ban paragraph source guess what just money green sheets decorated paper deal with also noticed that bogota holds car free day once year honestly say well played treating annual tradition the right move get group people regardless amount something been getting positive comments paragraph source well which sign that will last long time sum the second advantage that gives people the opportunity enjoy the outdoors that basically the most brief explanation can give that makes sense,2
during this paragraph the author would talk about how venus like earth well the closest like being earth for example they even called its twin and talked about how venus was once filled with ocean venus simple see from the distant but safe vantage point earth think what the author trying say from this that supports the study venus because his her point view that very similar earth and way being despite the fact that venus dangerous the author gives much information for example lets know how thick its atmosphere the percent carbon dioxide has the temperature although everything dangerous the human body and there bad wealth erupting volcanoes and string earthquakes instead hiding those facts she adds them making more interesting all the information that being given making you want study more even dangerous shows that supports the studding and knows the worth and most that goes last but not least the author gives information about the studies that have been done informs about nasa and how has the idea sending humans more indepth study venus although she talked about the great sides venus they included the down falls and the things that happen from earthquakes volcanoes oceans the way human could live there they bring many facts about both showing that they know the dangerous things instead not using the negative stuff she pulls and uses strong defense and brings good things well conclusion the author very into the study even dangerous and makes interesting read,3

facial action coding system new technology that enables computers identify human emotions personally think that sounds like good well built successful invention there are lot technologies and experiments that haven worked the past but think this could actually get the researchers somewhere technology seems increasing everyday and feel like the new facial action coding system good step make and push forward for the future the process starting with computer make model face that includes all fourty four major muscles the model must move just like you see real living human without the muscle movement features people would not able tell how this creature persa actually feeling emotionally physically the fact that the professes and scientist are putting that much thought and detail into this object mind boggling the author then explains paragraph six that the mona lisa demonstration actually intended make the people looking smile also shows how much the computers can and make while looking this newly invented object should make you think about how was all created and how all came personally feel like this new invention called facial action coding system could make good impact the kids the future most people nowadays love technology and know how all works feel like good invention and could impact not just humans but also the world more jobs careers and opportunities will take charge with this new object hand think could become something new helpful and entertaining,2
were real martian creation then you would able see possible life forms around and wouldn facing towards the sky would like statue plus would have been really fantastic discovery and would try make contact with the martians and see how they live and survive the planet could possibly live there one day nasa would send space crafts and rovers mars could study the creatures finding out how survive mars and the other planets important and something humans should learn how just case something happens earth and aren able back but you can see the pictures just messa natural cause nature something that happens earth but just happened look much like face from the possible clouds and blurry picture from the first many people nasa want wanted that statue something that living creatures has made but you see the pictures starts look more like natural cause natural cause,2

feel though driverless cars are very controversial the are some pros and cons having computer control car with that being said feel though driverless cars are not something that should happen least not now there are far too many complications that come with not having drive there fine line between needing something and desperately wanting and feel though cars that don need drivers are something that people just want feel though the amount people that need driverless cars pales comparison what else could done with the money that spent driverless cars the passage clearly stated that idea for driverless cars ridiculously expensive granted the idea was from the but there doubt that total cost driverless cars would still outrageous driverless cars just seem unneccessary because the money spent driverless cars could towards something better like starving children homeless people another flaw having driverless cars are the danger technology where near perfect and one small mistake the car could cause ginormous car accident what child darts out infront car and there driver stop what there accident and the driverless car doesn detect there are too many possibilities for something that isn necessity far driverless cars aren even driverless people still need sit the front seat and they still need alert all times they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents also there isn set date for when the driverless cars will get done car companies plan releasing some driverless cars but there are complications that could arise and slow down the process driverless cars seem cool and they could make things easier for the human population however cars that don need drivers are something that the world doesn need right now there are too many what ifs that come with driverless cars besides there are more useful things that people could putting their money focus and time building shelters for people need donating food and water countries that have lack and attempting make the world safer place for people are thing that people should focusing not just new car that seems cool,4
dear senator florida what the point people voting they are not really getting say who they are really voting for the electoral college has bigger say then the thousands people who vote how can group peoples say mean more then thousands people the united states also the winner take all sytem does not help anymore then the electoral college does what special about the electoral college that they get picked specially make their vote count who wins loses the election their has been many misshapes because the electoral college for example from excerpt called the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses are wrong says the single argument against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worst this shows that the electoral college does damage the united states because they let huge crisis happen during the elections they could have let get even worst because they allow and make easy make things worst certain crisis feel like you should give the people more say because half the people that vote probably don even know that they are not actually voting for the president they probably vote thinking that they are voting for the president not for the electoral college see who will end the board the electoral college overall unfair the voters voters pay vote what pay the electoral college vote and make their say important sad the reason sad because all kids want when their younger vote because they feel like symbolizes them growing and like they get real say who the next president the senate anything just longs they get say but truthful their not getting say who will the next senate treasurer president their actually picking the board who will picking for them even the people once wanted abolish the electoral college these people were richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce and the afl cio turned out their not the only ones according the excerpt from the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses are wrong sates they not alone according gallup poll taken shortly after gore thanks the quirks the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over percent the voters would prefer direct election the kind have now also states that this year voters can expect another close election which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency this show how the elections are way screwed because they already way know how many votes certain person going get and how many votes the other person going get they practically already know who going win the election before the voting even begins because the board already has all planned out really thier need for the electoral college because all they make the competion unfair for the other person going for the election also because they have cause been part problems and misshapes article mentions perhaps moat worrying the prospect tie the electoral vote that case the election would thrown the house representatives were staes delegation vote president also when you are voting for the vice president you are not actually voting the senat picks who the vice president the electoral college overall unfair the voters and the people running the election,4

using the facial action coding system classroom setting for students valuable because can enhance how humans can express and analyze emotions and from each other valuable skill learn being able express ones thoughts and emotions others well learning this school essential for students the classroom and wherever else they life for better knowledge how listen others and also communicate message with certain tone others humans unconsciously convey through their face what they are feeling but completely knowing how person feeling from their facial expression not always possible with this accurate technology the software can translate anatomical information electronic code examining the way that one reveals emotion through their face can help that person fine tune their expressions convey even conceal their thoughts and emotions through this technology students would able have better understanding how express emotions and messages others addition analyzing what others communicate them,2

the advantages limiting car use very important would have torro much about drunk drivers someone dying becasue car crashes always hear news about how someone was killed drunk driving limit car usage the deaths people would all time low also limiting car usage would also mean not much pollution breath lot pollution through the day because when trucks drive all that black smoke goes into the air that breath that can good for our bodies another example would gas always complain about how much gas limited cars then wouldnt have pay for gas anymore have cars pay insurance every month didnt have cars imagine how much money would saving not paying for insurances gas and other things need for our cars good shape and safe for drive another thing walking riding bikes get point posin would decrease the chance for beastly think less crime would happen limited cars for example less peope would hit wouldnt promote drunk driving would help the population and would have less money problems america debt limit car usage could pay off that debt and would helping world the same time not polluting the air our bodies would better shape because would have walk ride dikes get somewhere conclusion think limit car usage america would better lace live not many deaths money problems pollution essay listed examples how would help the economy and people around the world the world would better place with cars worry about money would not issue for most wwe would have one less thing worry about,3
the author this story does not support his claim that venus worth exploring good way using problem solution method clearly and completely describes issues with exploring and studying venus then explains possible solution for said issues but the author does not actually support his idea describing how the knowledge venus would worth the risk the challenge exploring venus the author gives good substantial reasons support studying venus presenting risk then simply giving innovation that would atleast reduce the risk shown the text the author states issue such the planet surface temperatures average over degrees farenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the author continues going saying the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans would encounter and how conditions are extremely inhospitable clearly states one problem with studying venus and all the risks that come along with that problem but then explains innovation reduce the risks after describing all the risks and dangers the paragraphs before hand the author then says nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would all scientists float above the fray then goes into descriptive detail about how this innovation would work the author continues using the problem solution through several his paragraphs answer many questions one could have about studying venus throughout the story continously talk about innovation and imagination and how with these things could find safer way study venus but never actually says how the information will beneficial used most the paragraphs the author states the extremely harsh and uninhabitable conditions venus then explains how get around those dangers but does not explain what gain from knowing and learning about these exact conditions the reader would more compelling added more detail about how this would useful and worth depsite the dangers venus presents but instead only talks about how get there althought the author did good job with presenting the risk and fixing those risk but did not quite express how would all worth the end but the end the prompt was about how studying venus worthy pursuit and there was not lot content that this piece writing the author did not support this idea very well,4
the electoral college time worn system some people hate others defend their dying breath the electoral college longer good way select our nations leader because the power longer rests with the people through the electoral college system put our votes into the trust strangers who may may not decide vote how they want and completely disregard our voices plus with all the corruption government wouldn the most difficult thing buy voter off and potentially change the outcome the election the electoral college voters could end clueless untrustworthy bradford plumer source paragraph points out can voters always control whom their electors vote for not always voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate sometimes proving the point that the people are not control granted there are few small benefits the electoral college usually prevents the confusion ties inside states and source paragraph richard posner says voters toss states are more likely pay close attention the campaign really listen the competing candidating that they are going decide the election they are likely the most thoughtful voters average and the most thoughtful voters should the ones decide the election the problem with the overwhelming power given the swing states the electoral college that does not represent the american idea that one group people control that everybody has equal say the matter when state like california votes for candidate that candidate immediately has advantage from the start and all the people california who voted for the other candidate are not heard all corruption again major problem with most politics including the electoral college segregationists nearly replaced all the democratic electoral voters louisiana with voters who would instead oppose john kennedy and potentially cost him the election but while small group people can bought off and turned vote against the majority impossible corrupt the american people would also cause candidates have pay more attention the smaller states and the states that the candidate thinks they will win over automatically due their current party the american people need the power elect their leader back their hands again the electoral college was good system years ago but with time comes change,4
the electoral college has been used for years agree that must keep this way yes possible that the outcome the popular vote that the people have chosen not agreement but has been the best way selecting president highly unlikely that when the people vote for certain selection the candidates group electors will change their mind has happened before but rare suggest that the electoral college stay and not change the election because has not only been used for years but also some the citizens may make mistake who they vote for and atleast with the electoral college can make sure have the right president each candidate has their own electors and take electoral votes choose president and since they are from the same group they wouldn choose someone else has happened says the excerpt this system has been used for years why change now the electoral college has worked this way for years the founding fathers came with good process completely fair all the people get select their candidate and the electors know what their responsibilities are the citizens aren completely able control the electors ideas but they might have bit more knowledge the subject some citizens may get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate excerpt from passage this refers the fact that may have chaos let the people decide directly who our president need insider review our peoples choices and make sure that the correct one and what better way than have the electoral college depends the state and the candidate political party which you chose the people will get what they asked for their has been times which that not always the case but the electors usually make the decision the people has asked for said the passage defense the electoral collage each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the party nominee and the trust rarely betrayed this system the best one yet our people are well informed but not always take out the electoral college are leaving our country their hands and people make mistakes sometimes with the electoral college have various people making the right decision like when author writes book they don get published right away they have people make sure their spelling correct and they make many other different corrections the same with the electoral college and the way the president selected state senator suggest keep this system,4

their are still tons people that think the mesa the planet mars face created aliens they think this because when nasa took the pictures everyone that saw thought was face nobody thought was just natural landform when was just natural landform called mesa the reason that impossible for that mesa mars actually face created aliens because the new cameras with high resolution picture looks nothing like face just landform the first picture was took way back inn they didn have cameras with picture quality that have now the mesa really looks like could face but then they took some more pictures the face and still kinda looked like face but more like landform then they took more pictures with camera that had high resolution quality and then scientist proved that was just normal landform but their still was people that thought was still face the some aliens created even though scientist nasa proved was mesa but for some reason tons people thought that nasa had something hide the mesa that people call the face mars has been movies and newspapers because lot conspiracy theorists think that nasa trying keep the face secret because they think nobody should know about even though the pictures prove that just normal landform,3

the new technology read students emotional expressions very helpful idea now will able know when someone losing intrust becoming bored the process begins when the computer contrasts computer model the face the facial axton coding system enables computers identify human emotions wow can actually calculate emotions like biology homework the process begins when the computer constructs computer model the face all major muscles the model must move like human muscles would able identify six basic emptions happiness surpise anger disgust fear and sadness the class room your not always happy but maybe somebody something knew that you wasn happy could change that the new technology should put class room help the unhappy student happy least try make them happy say this because when you not happy then you don really feel like doing any school work maybe the new technology can help change you your attitude human facies don lie for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look there face alot would have different feelings but are face show different the reason why the the facial action coding system would bad idea for school the cost where will the school get the money from for them get this high technology from who will the paying for them something was brake the facial action coding system would cost arm and leg get fixed just because the high technolgy used make need these the class room had the new technology the class room love because when you get bored the technology would recognized that and will switch something else you are still happy the technology will know and will keep switch see change emotion you are still happy the technology could even put smiling face make you smile because sometimes all you need good smile think the new technolgy good resource for the classroom and can really help and improve the education the class room,3
machines get smarter everyday something most see but may not take into consideration think about your search history your gps destinations even your wifi hotspots the machines gather information about make our lives easier most the times good thing they help reminding things and let connect the rest the world with just few keystrokes however this facs would have major impact the school system would terrible decision implement facs into the school system don get wrong love technology improved and become what many consider just dream always many things that could not physically far say that they smarter than few ways they give results and they learn more and more about some that concerning think that machines are secretly learning about human behavior and plotting plans take care the world most don care don mind either way people have different views this which brings new point implementation the facial action coding system schools the facial action coding system facs profiler profilers monitor how subject works thinks acts and even feels scary huh put that into school system and you may just have found treasure trove blackmail now know what some will say this system will help help the students facs will help decrease school shootings those individuals make good points but there one thing you have consider human behavior people don just cough how they feel most the time have eye watching them and judging them will only make them hate more may make people feel worse off than they originally were end with this yes the system could beneficial long the right hands privacy critical part people lives and most like not broken into have this system the school system would bad call especially high schools those are some seriously tough times for some and pushing those people could result event very bad event,3
the author challenges the nasa and the scientists explore venus without worrying any dangers that planet which weird think about but think know the reason why says that nasa and the scientists give simple job for astronaut the planet venus and collect some samples for she goes that planet and gets into trouble that causes him her die sorry they have idea what except the author makes idea make ship hover safely without any danger and try not land another reason that says that because didn want look dangerous side but like the curiosity and the imaginative side paragraph states that our travels earth and beyond shouldn limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet thee very edges imaginacion and innovation the last reason could think that nasa could smarter than today they could make computers without any electronics all they could make clothing with heating disability the legs the ship magnesium and probably shield protect himself herself without getting hit the scientists could help with them probably claim any planet with the brains team conclusion said that phrase not careless dying for the cause the world end but support the team they complete the challenge then they could the greatest and only nasa the planet they couldn then that okay could just live another planet die live heaven could support them too with just little bit our brain and love not zombie,2
the face mars what the face mars was actually created aliens how would have the world reacted well wouldn know the face mars actually mesa that happens shaped like face know that the face mars was not created aliens because there are signs life far nasa knows there life mars the face mars just mesa but the face was created aliens would able see symbols and signs but all you can see are just small valleys and ridges aliens did not build the face mars far know there visible life mars the reason for this because mars inhabitable the conditions are mars are harsh for any living organism able live there have been many expeditions rovers that have roamed the red planet for years and still have not seen any forms life the author states there was alien monument after all with all this would almost impossible for life form able live mars eventhough there visible life mars there has never been sign life ever being mars again with all the probes and missions mars there has never been one hundred percent fact that there has been life mars the mars rovers have taken over samples and still have found signs life ever being the planet when the author quotes jim garvin we photographed the face soon could get good shot the reason for this because the planet has life and the only exciting thing that the scientists nasa could find was just mesa that looks like face all all this not creation made aliens mesa the red planet mars nasa has released facts about why this wonder mars just normal natural landform nevertheless april cloudless summer day cydonia global surveyor drew close enough for second look we had roll the spacecraft degrees center the face the field view said garvin the author also gives this peirce information each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo with this all being said with the high resolution picture and the quote from the scientist nasa you can say for sure the face natural land form although some people might say this not natural land form they might say that alien artifact left some martians some garbage like that some people dont under stand that crazy land forms cajuns occur naturally the author gives the reader wonderful example this our own planet what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte landforms common around the american west it reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin thats lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars earth believe that the mesas the american west can made the earth doing what does why cant mars make its own land forms the face mars just natural land form one mars mesas there are signs life mars there have never been any signs life mars and the face mars just cool looking formation made mesa biome what will you doing accepting that the face mars looking every little nook and cranny the web lies called the internet find out what the real truth about the face mars,5
the face mars landform that looks just like face even though looks like face has been proven that just landform and you zoom you can tell that isnt manmade there are landforms earth that look just like the face too scientists have zoomed the picture and have proven that the face mars just martian equivalent butte mesa butte mesa are landforms common around the american west and are also mars the face mars just really odd shaped butte and people have mistaken for alien structures the face also kind looks like butte called middle butte idaho people have also said that the face looks about the same height the middle butte idaho the people nasa had the first pictures the butte zoomed out enough that looked like face the nasa camera that takes pictures mars wierd position doesnt pass the face that much and when does its not very close when they zoom the pixels are too big see when they actually got good picture the face people started realize that was just wierd landform when they got good picture people probably stopped thinking that aliens made and just ignored even though scientists have proven that the face mars just landform some people probably just think they are trying cover landforms can have all kinds shapes and the face mars just has very unique shape conclusion the face mars just odd shaped butte,3
the challenge exploring venus talks about scientist thoughts about exploring venus they send spacecrafts but they didn last more than few hours this article the author inform about point studding venus despite the danger scientists find this planet challenging and important the author inform how fascinate are scientifics about venus the planet has really familiar surface and features nowadays they are working more developing secure conditions travel there scientifics are curious even more many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus paragraph venus important planet and close our solar system this makes scientifics more curious they develop more machines they will able search more information that can help them aware the danger the author explains the danger they can put themselves into but they want examine all closely venus has palaces where people can live too and the sun close them this what makes more important the author also talks about the risks but they want visit and explore more about this evening star venus will not limit their challenges even venus has the hottest surface all and that extreme humans striving meet the challenge presented venus has vale not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors paragraph scientist know about all the danger they are putting themselves into but they want know more the quote demonstrates that even dangerous they want satisfy their curiosity and maybe send people there because venus really close maybe they can form part the earth other living planet this article they talk about evry risk and how important form them investigate more about venus they want planet near and with good conditions for maybe people maybe the future they will finally reach their goal and will travel other places out the normal world are use they reach their goal that will important part the nasa history will beyond expectations,3

venus sometimes called the evening start one the brightest points light the night sky our solar system venus the second planet from the sun the nickname evening star was given since venus actually planet venus the closest planet the earth terms density and size and sometimes the closest distance too the differences speed betwen earth venus and mars that sometimes are closest the mars and sometimes are closest venus the explication why not single spaceship has touches down venus moran than three decades that each previous mission was unmanned since spacecraft survived the landing for mora than few hours the atmosphere venus almost percent carbon dioxide but one thing that dangerous venus are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the atmospheric presure venus times grater than our planet that means that the planet surface temperatures average over degrees farenheit that extreme danger for also notable even mercury closer our sun venus the planet with the hottest surface temperature our solar system also this the weather condition and the presure venusian geology present other problems for example there are many active volcanos powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes the reason why scientists are even discussing the possibility futures visits venus because the planet most liked the earth our solar system one time maybe venus was covered oceans and life just like the earth nasa maybe have one solution human can explore venus venus would allow scientists float above the fray just our jet airplanes travel higher altitude fly over many storms thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees farenheit but the presure would closest the earth presure there are still not easy condition but there can survival for humans however researchers can not take samples rok gas anything else from distance many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus nasa working other ideas solve this problem venus for example they are making electronic device made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface striving meet the challenge present venus our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,2
come attention that more and more people everyday seem believe that the face created aliens unfortunately cool would was not the face simply just natural landform with shadows casting down making look has face everyone has just been seeing this information magazines and and believing true but they never seem believe the truth that not face created aliens this common for this planet create natural landforms well most people just believe created aliens because they hear information from thier friends they see see magazines the truth most these things not even have enough evidence prove what they are saying they just believe true because interesting they not even have the proof that aliens exist and cool may seem just not true know some people will come their senses and realize what they are saying when they say that they believe aliens exist and people just look them like they are stupid have other evidence well that aliens exist which means pretty much have believe that natural landform which know most people will stick thier belief that aliens are real and that they created the face but they are not real and they didn know may make some people upset stating the facts but just telling the truth having other evidence leads believe just normal natural landform with shadows not blame those you that believe was created aliens sounds cool right but sorry the bear bad news but also the truth these landforms are common this planet well not unusual for these landforms occur just the certain shape that sees have cough everyone attention the shape itself not what created the face but fact was just the shadows that made look had had the shape and form face humans have this natural landform known mesa which you may have heard before the point these types things happening this planet very common believe myself that just natural landform beacuse know that not have enough evidence prove that was anything else also believe just natural landform mesa because know these things are common this planet don just going around telling people aliens exist before you get the actual facts there were further evidence leading make believe there were aliens would fine just don have that extra information evidence hope finally lead some you believe the truth that the face just natural landform,4
studying venus wroth pursuit despite the dangers venus also named after strip club but any who its sometimes call the evening star its one the brightest points light the night sky venus also planet well second planet from our sun earths twin thick atmospheric almost carbon dioxide the clouds highly sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planets surface the temperatures average over fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times then experience dusty indianapolis done talkin about venus something named after club bur anyways striving meet the challange presented venus has value not only because the insight gained planet itself this teacher testing room look like allen think she from venus but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors,1
all our development since world war has been centered the car and that will have change official the transportation for america david goldberg credible source for information regarding transportation america however there are places all around the world were automobiles are causing problems limiting car usage could help solve many those issues america the topic alternative transportation has been discussed many times but previous bills appropriations have law gone highways and only other transport this can found paragraph the first source the fifth line sadly america not the only country having problems paris france diesel cars make the vehicles and the diesel eul blamed for the smog accumulation the city paris warmer layer air caused cold nights and warm days trapped the car emissions which then caused five day period intensifying smog france smog build rivaled that beijing china which claimed one the most polluted cities the world this problem also exists the states transportation the second largest cause america emissions right behind power plants ensure safety anyone who was still driving their car was fined euros bogota columbia followed france their violation fee and charged any violate bogota has created day without cars which cars are used promote alternative transport and the reduction smog levels another positive effect cars can have would more peaceful enviroment stated sources and america recent studies show that americans have been buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses although may far the future america may soon follow the lead vauban germany where completely car free this probably won happen anytime the near future but the use automobiles has gone down the united states bill ford chairman the ford motor company proposed city which pedestrians bicycles private cars etc are used save time lower emissions and improve safety sees this future hopefully others will too although america might not exactly like vauban good hope that will get there someday cars would result calmer atmosphere and more peaceful lifestyle also would lower the emissions made vehicles which turn would save the atmosphere thus saving life earth cars would also help improve safety both animals and people may not completely there yet but the world will someday have need for cars and that will the first step into the future,2
reading this article would doubt certain that using facs facial action coding système for the emotional expressions students classroom valuable could keep the attention the students inside classroom paragraph mentions why facs good and helpful tool use inside classroom according prof thomas huang the beckman institute for advanced science the unversity illinois classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored chaung also goes and predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor chaung telling this information shows that using facs our students may pay better attention class becuase they are not confused nor bored another reason why using facs important because has the potential increase the students intelligence conclusion facs good and helpful advancement techology that could one day schools everywhere would make school less boring and could keep the attention the students inside the classroom,2
facial action coding system classroom have you heard about the new computer software called facial action coding sytem this software can detect what kind emotion you are feeling this latest innovation comes from two professors and some colleague experts they are all developing better ways for computer communicate with people the use this technology could and should used even read students facial expressions classroom first reason why believe that this latest technology should used read students facial expressions classroom because can modify the lesson for example when student class and looking computer screen and becoming confused bored the computer will recognize this when recognizes this can than modify the lesson way where can make that frown upside down the lesson will than become more interesting and the student will than willing the work because she enjoys second reason why the facial action coding system should used classroom detect students facial expressions because will help them academically for example when student has work something the computer that visually interesting she will better job actually putting some effort the computer will read the facial expression the student and continue giving them things the screen that will keep smile there face this will result the student scoring well whatever was they were working because drew there attention enough for them continue reading and looking the screen conclusion using the facial action coding system has its benefits when using this new technology classroom the students will not only happy but will help them well school well you won ever have read anything class that boring make sure you take this new computer software into consideration the next time you are working something the computer,4
fellow citizens there are many reasons why limiting car usage has outstanding opportunities and advantages for example there aren people out there spending their hard earned money that they worked for for expensive car that they are just going use get someplace faster when they could just stop being lazy for once and walk run ride bikes hike take bus instead spending money after money fill car just waste gas and fill again running riding bikes hiking etc gives you chance experience reality being outside gives people chance see the earths real beauty and smell the fresh air limiting car usage helps people stay shape and keeps them healthy their not just sitting car for half hour when they could running walking residents vauban germany are permitted car ownership but there are only two places park large garages the edge the development where car owner buys space for along with home about percent vauban families not iwon cars about percent sold car move there having car makes peoples tense and being place where there isnt alot car sgae makes people much happier people who live places where cars arent used often other states those towns place stores walking distance main street rather than malls along some distant highway amazing advantage that people can can from limiting the usage cars less drunk drivers even none there less drunk drivers there less car crashes and less deaths everyone understands that you have older most states drink alcoholic beverages the big advantage out this older people were get drunk they would forced call cab even walk home their not putting noone else life danger and this would lower the crashes and death fatalities per year many cars that there the world all the use them would probably pollute the world paris enforce partial driving ban clear the air the global city after days the near record pollution limiting car usage gives you the opportunity with your family and friends and spend more time with them then you normally would having car you can walk and talk with them the way work you can stop the park and have some fun your way the grocery store the best part about this you dont have worry about the roads being busy you walk run hike and bike without having hear the noisy streets the honking the screeching etc what the point having car that your just going wasting money when running walking riding bike free and even cheaper and safer than driving car what are you gon na when your car breaks down are you gon na keep spending your money when keeps breaking why that when you have two perfectly good and healthy legs and you can run walk somewhere just take moment think about the fines every single person breathing the world has received alot money wasted something idiotic huh just imagine every state continents islands and places dont know about all stopped using cars even just limited the car usage saving whole ton money basically all middle classes this whole situation win win you get with your family running walking biking hiking etc all amazing way keep people healthy people dont have worry about drunk drivers car crashes car fatalities people can finally stop spending their hard earned money that they just going keep spending and wasting gasoline fix your car when its having problems and breaks families can save the money that they would normally spending gasoline and start saving for trip take their family spend more time with them take trip for yourself there are plenty more reasons and outstanding advantages that limiting car usage gives you but these are some the very best just remember the only good advantages car can give you getting you somewhere faster and keeping you comfortable and safe but they are also the most dangerous and expensive things out there they can take your life someone elses instant and they can put you debt quicker than you know limiting car usage for you,4
position driverless cars that against the development these cars three reasons why don agree with this because they don all the driving not all drivers will paying attention and people won need get elisions need there permit and will break the carral driving the car dosen drive all itself you will take over there work zones there accidents since dosen drive work zones accidents how would you know there one what you sleeping your going high way and your sleeping long road trip and there ascendent ahead you there work zones you wouldn passable know and you will ending accident this leads second reason that not all drivers will paying attention the road since the car will driving self they won need looking the road they will busy there phone sleeping this will cause alot increase accidents dividers don pattinson while the car driving also will increase alot accidents teens since they will there phone and wouldn care whats going last resona that people won need permit elisions anymore this could dangerous since the car going doing all the work there isn point passing the permit test your not taking the wheel the lisson test driving the car because your not going driving its the car this will affect because never know the people out there and can trust them all this why disagree the driverless cars this will affect and cause more accidents and people won paying atention this why dont think agree with this,3
the article driverless cars are coming the author represents both sides this argument the two sides the argument are that should have the driverless cars and shouldn have them start off should have these driverless cars because wouldnt cause much polluting would have less taxis and they are easier then buses using these cars can make the percentage polluting down could change global warming and stop the ice from melting and the polar bears from dying could stop rivers and lakes from drying and could possibly stop the ocean level from rising and flooding with these driver less cars could change the world and yeah thats pretty chessy but its true could save thousands lives from these cars because that put out any pollution there for climate change and global warming would help fix alot things that humans cant really fix hand has nature the rate that the world putting pollution are killing alot animals and people could stop deforestation these cars would really save the world used them and would for the better the other hand these cars are somewhat pretty bad because all the electricity that just one car needs would cause burn more coal which would cause more pollution the did befor got them yeah they might better for driving and slowing down the percentage for pollution but wouldnt stop would slow down dramatically but not enough change alot things need are car that runs something that wouldnt use energy gases because both cause pollution could have had these type cars sooner but didnt have the electronics that have now didnt have the computers the sensors didnt have any that yeah they would started probably couve figured out different way change how they are built and how the put out gases finally after putting both these together still pretty hard choose because both are but just need something better could start off with this and try out and see what happens but then different manufactories would try better then one another and would cause things get out hand and then they would have the government involved and would cause huge fight and people would mess honestly its not worth all the trouble and the mis understanding and confusion basically dont need might well keep going and looking for better ways then this and cause huge mess,3
the author describes making mona lisa smile and how new technology called the facial action cording system enables compress identify human emotions because the author trying tell how the technology can make feel differents emotions this article can find too many differents emotions that the mona lise had and how the techonology can too for example first evidence that found this article when said that mona lise percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry trying tell that making mona lise smile can difficult way because she had too many differents emotions the same time but nothing impossible but also the people trying describe new technology identify humans emotion the new technology called facs facial action coding system this the new technology that the author wanted used find the humans emotions and see which one the two option that they had can more easy more faster find the human emotions other example that also found this article when said that according the new computers software can recognize emotion the software the least innovation from prof thomas chaung the backman institute for advanced science the university millions the author trying tell describes the new technology was little complicated because with wanted describe that technology see will more easy identify the emotions also this article said that the process beings when the computer construct computer the face all muscles the model must move like human muscles that why think that describes that new techology wasn eassy because the new technology need identify all about human conclusion about the computers and how mona lise demonstration was really intended bring smiles your face while show you just how the computers can you smile when web appears your screen similar simputer could recognize too like said haught predicted that the computer could recognize when students another person becoming confused sad and acording the facia feedback theory emotion moving uracil muscles can make feel not only expresses motion but also can even help feel like some differents emotions,1
acording the artifical advantage limiting car usage less usage diesel gasoline because paris enforced partial driving ban clear the air the global city diesel fuel was blamed for the reasoning the ban clear air since france tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline diesels make percent vehicles france compared percent average diesel engines the rest western europe according reuters also another advantage limiting car usage that the article talked about was that there has been large drop the percentage years olds getting there license dont want anyone the road that has not been approved safe driver even approved able drive also just think about how the percentage just going keep dropping over the years the artifical also stated other advantages like that being telecommute allows people feel more connected without driving and included citizen bogota colombia opinion who stated good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution,2
this life think that there should limited amount car usage for the simple fact that gas bad for the earth many way some people this may untrue but think that the limited amount car usage would great for the earth reason being that car make people excessive less causes smog bad for the enviroment begin with think that limited amount car usage good for lazy people mean people will waste gas just drive minutes store when you could walk save gas really makes sense that average person could lazy you can doing two good things one time just walking for your health and saving gas the text says many experts expect public transport serving suburbs play much larger role next think good idea because wont cause much smog which bad thing for the air according the text paris has banned driving due smog paris enforced partial driving bad clear the air the global city the last thingie need breathing dirty air and pretty much gas almost drivers were fined twenty seven people had there cars impounded for their reaction the fine also final reason that bad for the enviroment luckily the text says president obama ambitious goals churn the united states its about time some one point out the wrong honestly opinion was president would ban driving unless your like traveling far out state your work really far think that should not allowed sum all think that limited amount car usage would good for the enviroment and have good impact the world once again reasons for that make people excessive less causes smog bad for the enviroment fellow citizens think about what you are doing the world and how not only effects but how also effects you,3
the author suggest the reader study venus isnt directly the text but she gives you the idea that you should look into throughout the article the author talks about venus and others planets out solar system but mainly talks about venus and mars the author tells that venus isn actually evening star just has that name because closer the sun venus also referred earth twin because the closest planet density and size and sometimes distance the text says venus can right around the corner space even though venus right around the corner have still yet land actually spaceship there hasn been any space craft the has been successfully venus for more than few hours although paragraph says many researchers are working innovations that would allow our machines long enough contribute meaning our knowledge venus this tell that there still stuff learn about mars and this story isnt complete,1
driverless cars would good car only the driver didnt have wait drive the car would not wreck its own driverless cars dont seem like the most consistent cars the moment these cars seem cool but have many cons included these cars would put you more death risk than you driving yourself the driverless cars seem dangerous and inconsistent the reason for this because when the car driving its self the driver has take the wheel any moment the reason this dangerous because some people could fall asleep waking early their job and they wont want alert needed people would never know when they are about get into wreck they ever did because they arent control the vehicle the manufactures the vehicle should held responsible this machine crashes causes death the car can only hold under specific conditons but what you need somewhere and there ice the road you need get somewhere fast being hurry with this car problem the car only goes mph this means that you will have wake early going appointment far distance area you wont able take highways either these cars have great features but also have many cons people need come consideration when buying one these cars think about your life and what you are risking people should not buy these cars into safety issues and driving speeds are fixed standard cars,3
the new technology called the facial coding sytem the best technology ever has verity features like the model the recognition emotion face annd the math homework app the model one way why people should choose this technology because you have model computer then everything looks big and clear this proves that now and days people like watch thing and look things big and clear that why you should take this technology the recognize emotion another reason why this nice technology for example this shows how you feel the way you expressions look the author says using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements real life the painted face mona lisa this proves that the facial emotion can work anything whether person picture someone the math homework the last reason why you should buy this technology fact this also part the emotion senser like whether you feel like doing not for example the text says hold can actually calculate emotions like mathworks this proves that the technology can tell want something not emotion the new technology can really determine person conclusion the emotion homework and computer are the best features have technology and people would love too they had want get one,2
the future almost here but not going good one those driverless cars are going harm going destroy this world the cars the futre are going look cool and all that but are not good for people rive the driverless cars that are coming are going expensive not safe and complicated first these driverless cars are going very expensive because they going advanced and the people are who made them are going want charge alot those people inventing them going spend alot money trying fix the roads and the cars they are going hope get that money all back making these cars like the article states that general motors created concept car that could run special test track what the moute says that they make car that advanced and cant run regular concrete road then they will have build road that the car can for that happen the people who built the car will have pay extra make road that good for the car and they will have test going through all that will cost alot money these cars they talk about will also need alot upgrades which will also cost money peerson wants buy the car will pay extra just because the car has extra things like upgrades the motor sensors and other stuff also the article says google modified toyota pruis uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror here this moute says some things that they put updated the car with all this construction road and updating things the car all going cost for the person who will buy the car thats why these cars will not make because they will expensive then another reason why against these cars because they are not going safe for the people they get this car like still driving because they still have ready incae something happens like there accident they have take control theres traffic they have take control the article says that the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel the driver has keep hand the wheel they mine well just drive because what they are saying there that the car could lose its function and drive the road this car not safe finally the driverless cars are going complicated becuase the car going have much and the people are not going know how work also people when they are driverless car they dont want anything because its supposed drive itself but the person has keep hand the wheel and alert and ready take over anytime and all the sensors and gps and other gadgets going alot control the sensors break what are they going nothing because they did not build the car and they will have like certain car shop cause not anyone will able fix sensor like break any other thing regular car the article says that has four automotive radar sensor gps recieve for all that work the orson will have learn work and learn fix incae being damaged with all these reason why against the driverless cars should changed your mind maybe thes cars are not going successful because they will expensive not safe and complicated with these three reasons people will not buy these cars because they are all reasonable,4
ths technology has helping the humans their invention over the time the software that detect how people are feeling while they are try hide their emotions the system called the facial action coding systems now variety industries classifier the basic emotion like happy surprise anger scary and sad the computer structure model the face detect their feeling when you are happy and smile looking the computer going detect how has you been school better and helping students doing better their grades facing the screen your classroom that students they are boring just confused their class showing student they don tike the class their teaching also students just wanted interesante topic each their class also developing wat communicate with humans and computers help recognize the face our peer for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face course most would have troubles actually describing each facial tria conveys happy worries etc just the computer can know the feeling you feel face with angry face but meanwhile showing happy face they even indicate the difference between genuine smile and forces one identify real smile not fake one its muscle the cheek fake smile the mouth its stretched sideway describe how the computer can detect real face just painted face describing the facial movement were the muscle the facial not expresses their emotion and also can structure their face with smile feeling other their emotions can also feel just creating emotions describing face can lie because their different muscles just telling the truth your self just communicate between humans and computers with their feeling,2
seagoing cowboys aren like pirates like land cowboys that rob people and awful things they help out people when they are recovering from the terrible things that hitler and world war brought them when you sign you don have risk doing army time and going fight becasue when you are seagoing cowboy counts for your service time also you get see the world and how other people are living and how cultural our world this essay will tell you reason why know did the right thing signing seagoing cowboy and why you should sign too the most important thing that was able was help out community and beyond when people were suffering from traumatic losses and hunger was able help heard and bring animals the jews germans and artisans that were all suffering from the outcome the war they were poverty and were need people safely get livestock them they could eat and whole again think that sighing you get that sense heroism and you know that you did good deed think that also signing really helps life death problems when signed knew that would have fight for country and maybe even die battle turned during first trip and knew would have stop what was doing and serve the army but when went speak with the army they said that helping bring food families wounded the war counted war time overjoyed becasue loved what was doing and didn want have end that also because didn have risk dying phew goodness thats why you should also sign you don have out and get shot also realized how big opportunity was and how much the world was going able see the cattle boat trips where unbelievable opportunity for small town boy like had the benefit sight seeing europe and china saw the acropolis greece and took gondola ride venice italy with streets water water people mean who would pass that opportunity toured excavated castle crete and awed the panama canal way china grece was very spacial and china was amazing when you take the chance going out and doing things the world you get see magnificent things even when your traveling between countries you get experience marine life and biology see that the thrill all that you get real hero not die and see the world through your own two eyes now people might say that you don get see everything and you need die for your country don listen them they are just being cynical you make the decisions and you don need one bad review change how you feel about doing something people might just judge you but guess what they are just jealous that you get see the world and true hero that why you should sign sea cowboy you never know where tomorrow will take you going try imitate uncle sam now need you seagoing cowboy,5
the central idea this article that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents not agree that the article supports this idea the author talks about all the geological environmental challenges presents talks about how haven set space craft there three decades that wasn even manned and only lasted few hours and how the planet isn liveable the first reason don think the author supports the idea because more than half the essay them talking about how venus awful when comes the actual form and environment venus the environment venus was spoken about throughout the essay stating percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acis venus atmosphere this creates huge challenge for scientists explore venus the plusnet also too hot like way too hot states the article the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the author talks about how the environment extreme that would crush submarines and liquefy many metals the second reason don think the author supports the idea they talk about how they haven sent anything there three decades they can send anything there because how bad the conditions are venus and nothing has ever survived states the article humans have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world each mission was unmanned since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the reason they haven anything because don have the ability the conditions there are too extreme for even our technology withstand and like what going discuss the next paragraph would take decades develop that technology the last reasons don think the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents because the planet not even liveable throughout the article the author constantly talks about how extreme the environment how could basically kill any humans with gas and heat and would still need decades innovations even think about even sending something there even developed that technology would have prove safe well took years even send people the moon and people still die while space just for common reasons conclusion may the twin venus but will take years and years and years even get close sending man even things venus because the enviromental issues venus unlivable and most things would never survive there for long periods time also have put any time and effort really discover venus and other things help get explore venus for these reasons that have stated above conclude that the author does not support the idea that that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents,4
luke point view convincing people this seagoing journey wants this wonderful cattle boat journey doesn want miss out this great opportunity this trip knows opportunity lifetime because his friend encouraging him but doesn leave home can resist the temptation goes anyway luke knows very rigorous job but knows might able help lot this trip that why goes lue loves this experience his adventure europe luke veer convicting why goes this adventure people want participate this because luke liked this journey many other people might when luke has check the animals each hour has make sure has chech them very painstakingly make sure every animal there when luke breaks his ribs that when you know that all his jobs are super rigorous and work,2
you ever wonder how many something how much something weights this essay the author compares more than one thing one another the author supports the idea the challenging exploring venus comparing earth venus twin and that the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closet distance too which means that earth the closet planet venus than any other planet the world another way the author supports his text saying that earth venus and mars our other planet neighbor orbit the sun different speeds what that means that all those other planets are the ones neighboring and that they have many different speeds and are many different sizes throughout the whole planet while orbits the third way the author supports his information the text how compares all the other planets one another not just one planet the next last supporting text the author supports this that thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus what the author trying say that one big thickness the atmosphere almost basically covered percent with carbon dioxide blanket conclusion the author compares all these planets one another the second paragraph the author loves use many different techniques describe the story people who are reading another thing the author does the story tell how much earth venus mars weigh throughout the whole story another way the author supports his evidence the story telling were they are located conclusion the author supports his text very well comparing the other planets each other not just one another also the author likes use numbers show how much the percent got covered how many times something happened during the times throughout the whole thing something got done covered,2
the facial action coding system very complex computer software that able read your face tell what emotions you are having let say you are sad and someone wants see what you are felling they could use this coding see what was your emotion and the computer would tell that you are sad this from technology unipresident their nothing else out there like this facial action system have many uses that can applied schools art and law enforcment this would help teachers able see what emotions that this person having because important what your students are trying learn school where you are teaching math you would like know what student was thinking huang said that when student becoming confused bored you would able tell with the facial action coding system this system will able improve what the instructor can teach because can see what are thinking these classroom computers will able tell what fell about the subject lets say are confused and the teacher knows that could explain what being taught you different way that you get the instruct can also see you are bored can tell you snap back into let the class take little break this new technology can give huge advantages schooling and other types fields that need able see what was happening over all this new computer coding system will able give advantages being able make our everyday lives better with the improvement our education and the ability see when someone sad this new technology amazing and can used our everyday lives because functional the schools need new break through teaching and this will able help improve this technology won cheap though because the harsh computer software that uses that will need more intense computer this facial action coding system will break through education and many other fields that will help teachers and other educators,3
many places around the world have been taking charge and limiting car use the public there comes some great advantages when doing this you can help limit greenhouse gases relieve the stress from cars and become less dependent your car for transportation the big advantage about limiting cars help prevent the rapid spread greenhouse gases the creates smog cities from source two you learn that cold nights and warm days cause the warmer layer air trap car emissions polluting cities even more with these dangerous gases the air the world great danger becoming unhealthy and are blame for this awful cause because the over use cars limiting the use cars you limit the amount pollution the air limiting car use finding other means transportation you can actually relieve stress put you from the constant beeping and noises made cars walking riding bike you hear the nice peaceful sounds the great outdoors while knowing you are doing good you and the environment some people seen source three have taken this experience the limiting cars share the experience with thier companion riding two seated bike good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution limiting the use cars you begin less depended cars this happening you learn your life will know longer circled around your car and you begin see that driving car everyday not really needed using public transportation car pooling you greatly decrease the amount pollution the air while also having ride work where ever you need limiting cars can have multiple advantages you can help stop half the greenhouse gases that are caused from cars relieve stress and become less dependent for the need car this will cause you become better citizen and help make the world last longer for hundreds generations come,4
space the final frontier this very commonly used phrase that the helm for space exploration since the beginning time humans have looked the sky and wondered what might that vast place above their heads the problem there simply technology advanced enough for scientists explore all that lies around them the article the challenge exploring venus the author definitely states the challenges exploring the planet but does not effectively support their claim that worth the risk the author presents the challenge venus inhospitable environment relation the earth simply laying down the facts without defending their side paragraph two the challenge exploring venus the text states each previous mission venus was unmanned since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the author gives explanation the quick deaths these spacecrafts well clearly outlining how hostile the environment thick atmosphere almost percent carbon blankets venus the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the author goes list more negative attributes such the temperature which averages over degrees fahrenheit the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system seems far that the risks definitely outweigh the rewards the author then describes technology that would help scientists explore venus but clear that this tech has not yet been developed the author mentions nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus which that scientists would float above the fray the problem with this statement that the technology has obviously not been tested yet and very likely not even developed the author use uncertain word possible connotes uncertainty and doubt that this idea will even work the author the challenge exploring venus then proceeds counter their own argument the next paragraph however peering venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can only provide limited insight ground conditions because most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere addition listing yet another drawback the environment the author blatantly states that the previously mentioned idea would not work for proper exploration venus the author simply relying the reader emotions and assumed interest space agree with the author rather than presenting facts back their argument the challenge exploring venus does give couple good reasons for exploring venus initially the fact that was once the most earthlike planet today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the author then goes describe these features valleys mountains and craters another reason given venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration the value returning venus seems indisputable but what are the options for making such mission both safe and scientifically productive assumed that the author ends this sound claim with statement pique interest but does just the opposite the use interrogative relays the reader that even the author who arguing for space exploration uncertain how these explorations will accomplished this effectively discredits the validity their statement the author relies too much objectives get their point across and that how they fail propose strong argument one must back their claims with facts persuade readers not simply state facts relation the negatives situation without refuting them conclusion the author presents weak argument that backed unfinished projects and assumed advocacy for space exploration rather than give the cold hard facts opposition and counter them with more facts that support their argument the author gives definitive research how scientists will about exploring venus the author simply states ideas accepting them sound solutions any problem that space may throw them the vast unknown not something toy lightly with lives and multitudes financing are the balance there room for possible ideas one must know with proof that these inklings imagination will sustainable when put the test space may the final frontier but this argument persuades readers believe that time yet come,6
for the value this technology read students emotional expressions start off with think this would good idea because says the article for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling just simply the look there face this proves you can probably tell how one your friends are feeling just expression there face but point this that the technology can tell what emotions your friend actually feeling this would helpful because sometimes you ask friend what wrong and they just say nothing but you know something wrong the way they are acting and this technology will help with that because and can tell what emotions they actually feeling addition this technology would also positive because you can know when anyone happy sad frustrated for example says the article imagine computer that knows when your happy sad for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different this shows that you can tell how someone feeling just based they smile frown personally against this because would love know what everyone feeling they asare freien oir not and know the real reason why they are acting the way they are matter they are sad happy conclusion for this technology read students emotional feelings because would like know how everyone feeling and acting the way they are for instance what friedland matter how close you are they will not ell you they are upset happy and you had this technology you could tell what they are feeling because they could lie and say they are not feeling anything which then this technology could then help with that,3

limiting car usage advantage many think its not advantage because its easy way get around may the easiest way get around but take the time out think about the bad cause you wont able live some places because the wont have enough parking spaces where are you going park the diesel fuel you use keep the car going pollute the air then would have alot bad air floating around its also problem the traffic why not carpool ride bus train bike there are many different transportations the world why just use one all the time you see cars may the easiest way get around but let study some the bad one reason limiting cars advantage because you don have car times out would easier for you stay anywhere some homing areas doesn have enough land make parking lot you see somewhere you would like live without parking lot who would probably have find somewhere vesle live you can slover that just getting rid your car understand that getting rid your car would probably the hardest thing you have ever done but look the bright side you would living the place you want living not only would easy find somewhere stay but also you wont have worry about polluting the air with diesel fuel its crazy how you spend dollars for gallon gas just pollute the air you would better off just spending dollars catch city bus train yes they also pollute the air but you ask not bad cars say that that because you think about you see more cars than any city bus train why not just catch bus train help our,2
the face mars really just butte that just lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa nasa has even proved that with the first puncture but people still didnt beleive them science can prove this taking pictures every few years see the différance the moragne photo does look like face but that was from then they took other photo and doesnt look like face all but people still didnt beleive them they took one more picture and revealed just mesa the martian area cydonia cydonia there are many mesas and buttes that proves that the martian face really mesa but you will still come with hawsers for the missing features like cloud the way the camaras couldnt get good image like said before nasa sent other probe get good image and was and pleased the public,2
the technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable because can lot more than just read emotions now can help understand each other help answer questions didn have the power answer and help become closer species the human emotion very hard understand but once you your life can become whole lot easier first think that the technology valuable because expressions are one the keys understand ourselves and each other the artifical states the facial expressions for each emotion are universal observes huang even though individuals often show varying degrees expression think expressions are way become sentient being also think its valuable because their are still lots questions answered but can because the lack technology but most can answered just using this the text states she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry all the words said the text were all just based photo think what can with photo that already dimensional finaly think that spices that motions sre one the thing that can hold back bring forward the future but that just hypothesis what think the text states according the facial feedback theory emotion moving you facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them emotions are one the keys our future and early tell but hopefully will special the human emotion very hard understand but with every thing that said the artifical you can only hope the computer really becomes something special for all observe,3
the challenge exploring venus the author was suggesting that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers would have pass through the author wrote about the dangers venus and how different could find way life there the author talks about how could benefit from the information from venus that venus the closest earth density and size and how are might eventually need another planet earth runs out recourses event happens that would result the earth dying and need somewhere the infomation that could get form venus could never ending the information that could get could change everybody life earth potentially venus could use the insight gained the planet improve our ways life earth and change them for the better the travels that take earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation order improve our society and how live earth and change for the better need have the information understand how should change for new and simula earth all know that the earth can last forever the earth lasting forever would impossible even though living venus would hard and uncomfortable the strength the human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors earth recourses last longer that most people are expecting there bound wars that would break the earth down eventually the earth needs backup that close enough the earth that could still survive the drastic change atmosphere venus our worlds closest match the difference the sizes the worlds uncanny would shock some people how the sizes are closer than any other planet the cardsystems venus also often refered earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too scientists have been working new kind blimp that can high our jet planes that would just hovering over venus and would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way this way living would hot and cruel people used the pressure having live such small environnement but sometimes life isn good the scientists that are trying help our population planet are doing the job that nobody wants they are making change and people who cant open their eyes dont see what the scientists think need happen for survival the author talks about how could benefit from the information from venus that venus the closest earth density and size and how are might eventually need another planet earth runs out recourses event happens that would result the earth dying and need somewhere,4
the connivance the cars would nice but what the car malfunctioned and crashed would the car owner responsible would the manufacturer hould the cars able hacked like cell phone laptop how would the person people the car know they are safe would not feel comfortable having computer driving around and deciding takes through bad neighborhood takes the long way around the psychological aspects automation are really challenge admits werner huber bmw project manager driver were put danger would that computer able get out that danger don think because again programed computer the car programed follow the laws set forth going over the speed limit get away from person trying harm the people with the way that stay alive then that what needs done the car programed the speed limit how many police officers would lose their job there would speeding there would need have them the road much what would happen there was fire the vehicles are programed the speed limit how will the fire fighters get the house time there accident because the person the car has control over how will the paramedics get the scene time the car doors are locked and there way get out crash there will more chance people dieting from car crash than before the cars come out the officers would have cut the person out that can done the crash bad that the person can cut out what does that say about cars manufacturer conclusion think that having driverless cars could cause more damage than good yes would more convenient but safe dont think,2
have you ever been mistaken the sight something well that what have been having problem with people have been thinking that the face mars not natural landform but trust have some evidence that supports this statement very well one the things that really sticks out and really makes believe that the face just natural landform the fact that has occured that mesa this might just but almost positive that landform like that couldn have been made from making something like face the surface sure that its grown over time the hills make look like face some type alien were make that dont think could turned into mesa know the face used lot clearer and slowly turned into mesa but think just the way landform grew the face isn very metrical sure that was aliens they would been more serious about this and tried make more metrical the article they say that years ago they were looking for place for nasa viking spacecraft land assuming that the spacecraft landed sometime later the future never saw any aliens they had seen aliens think they would said something especially after years would say this situation just like clouds sometimes you see clouds that might look like dog whale but you dont say anyone made those you wouldn assume was alien would say they are clouds that just happened float one another that formed into dog whale depending what the cloud actually looks like that usually the case cloud could look like big blob but then float next different one and form into something unique that happens naturally just like the face mars with all the things have said believe that evidence and what have pointed out will help other people know that the face just landform not saying everyone that hears ideas about this will automatically think its landform now but think that some them will change their minds they think was made any kind living species there are many landforms that were made just the way they are even doesn look like yes the face mars just landform and hopefully everyone will soon know this,3
the face mars just natural formation rocks and sand dust pictures show this everytime nasa does take picture there are the same results plus was alien why would nasa publish the pictures this was proof aliens would put people into freak out mode the first thing that giant rock formations aren uncommon the cydonia section mars fact there are whole bunch different kinds rocks just like the face only that those are normal looking they don look like faces the article even says that the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west even garvin says reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho then keeps going say that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars the second thing close images over the years nasa has been taking pictures this formation each time they take picture face the face starts look more and more like rock formation nasa even publicly posted pictures the web and all different kinds media show what the formation looks like nasa must been pretty confident what they were saying the picture was plus nasa made the top the line professionals they aren made people who dropped out highschool they are made people who have graduated from some the most advanced and institutionalized colleges third thing was alien why would nasa publicly show the pictures the article makes nasa look like they were trying get people get away from the alien idea the sound would take guess and say was alien nasa would everything their power keep the images from getting out into the public another thing that one point people were saying that the picture taken april was not liable because the fact that was cloudy time year the red planet nasa april took another photo the year and was not cloudy year for the red planet the photo even further backed the fact that the formation mars just another giant rock not some alien face artifact the end why would this alien face artifact nasa has publicly proven that just formation rocks and dust sand plus nasa didn wan know about aliens anything the sort why would they publicly anounced and show pictures the face mars that why the face mars not related anything alien all and just another formation the cydonia sector mars,4

the author the challenge exploring venus suggests that venus would worthy pursuit even considering all the dangers that poses and yes venus would worthy place research the only downside how dangerous can venus poses very challenging study from the plant itself being hard reach also given the planets conditions you wouldnt able get accurate data without being the surface from the thick atmosphere carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid while the templates above most the atmosphere are roughly around degrees fahrenheit you still could barely see through the thick blanket atmosphere while being degrees the surface with higher pressure than the deepest parts our ocean venus still worthy planet study venus known our sister planet from how size and density relative our own venus there also evidence the planet having water one point with canyons mountains ridges and valleys meaning probably supported life like our earth venus also the closest planet that relative our besides mars sum all venus very worthy subject more research besides all the dangerous factors,2

the electoral college not much place process created the founding fathers themselves consists electors and votes put forth those electors are required elect president the united states the electoral college should vanquished citizens don always have control over whom the electors decide support this problem because voters are sometimes mislead with the electors and vote elect the opposing candidate the year those who supported segregation were extremely close having electors that supported kennedy replaced with new electors that supported the actions segregationists these people attempted this because kennedy would never actually recieve the popular votes the votes were favor him the sense that some might argue that the electoral college perfect the way this invalid statement because the people america don realistically have say government decisions the electoral college doesn help society therefor needs removed from our system citizens the american society should decide the president not electors that think the people aren huge importance,3
scientist had discusses the overall topic about extraterrestrials and the creation the face mars giving the moss reasonable and lucid something clearly shown ideas there many reasons why this face was not made aliens scientist had explain some evidence that would show what this face classified also had show the main ideology these speculations conspiracies that know what nasa doing main job scientist observe study and explain many mysteries but had use clearly expressed qualifications for the face created aliens for first reasoning this topic had discuss this person how this landform classified mesa butte which occurs normally many environments like garvin said paragraph unmasking the face mars reminds most mille buttle the snake river plain idaho showing how this type landform isn really rare unique find could this something created aliens too well course not because mesa can nationalized many parts the hemisphere earth around the globe after showing the person what this exactly needed explain how these landforms are actually formed paragraph unmasking the face mars like garvin said that the mesa called middle buttle the snake river earth actually lava dome that take the form isolated mesa that about the same height the face mars proving that these mesa landforms are not unique anyone could think vividly possible and are actually formed naturally earth this actually scientifically proven research done over the years many mesa landforms earth another type reasoning this face not made aliens proven photographs tooke probes above mars atmosphere showing clear images this landform which gives another reason that this landform not even face first all this face was taken voyager making this photo not revenant for the accusations made this person best all the voyager had poor quality camera with meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared the image token mgs which had meter per pixel giving better quality and rendering the landform also the more revenant and sufficient evidence contrast the revenant photo for the idea the face shows that the face normal mesa instead the physical view face the surface mars rusted iron soil shown voyager though reasonings are supported with evidence and proof the person may accuse saying that nasa hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power said many conspiracy theorists well not going lie defenders the nasa budget actually wish there was ancient civilization mars this proves that nasa would show the public due the fact that will help fund nasa with more public support and would make nasa use that money funded for more research and expeditions conclusion there are many proven reason why the face mars not made aliens since the mesa landform not unique and there are plenty here earth since there are also many types evidence and research done how these landforms are made and since there are also details shown more easily through the revenant photos from mgs showing the face just your average mesa also that after all this time defenders the nasa budget actually hope for ancient civilization mars,5

through out the past and till now transportation has been huge role our society the past boats were the main and fastest transportation man had until man invented the automobile which changed transportation dramatically these automobiles made much easier travel around town even across the country what the people did not know the harmful effects these automobiles put out automobiles have there advantages which most the buyers look but they did not realize the disadvantages not only are they bad for the enviroment automobiles are the main cause death countries are working promote either car free car reduced communities said paragraph the united states working with the enviromental protection agency promote car reduced communities you may thinking yourself well not going ride bike every this true but not saying that neither are these agencies they are simply saying that try culling use busses trams ect riding bikes great way not only transportation but also fitness and its whole lot less expensive source states that president obama has had goals getting rid green house gas emissions and trying his best make america more enviromental nation studies show that people are buying less cars years and less people are getting their drivers licence america seems slowing down its rave the need drive and own cars more and more people are starting use bikes their prime way transportation overall automobiles have been probably the greatest thing invention man kind even though they may have their disadvantages just need try whole less dependent oni our automobiles and try carulla much another great way should keep doing and promoting the use beccles society will find their way through and hopefully try car reduced much possible,3
driverless cars can hindhead scary harmful thing when you are car you would want all the control you can get not little half none can relaxing and interesting nothing goes wrong driverless cars offer very little control from human which can also issue nervous thing with some people many people even newer cars today require less human handling type deal driverless cars can dangerous thing when you have none the control what your car may next could scary thing they can steer accelerate and brake themselves driverless car that can brake itself could very dangerous for instance what happens you come stop light sign and the car doesnt break something goes wrong the sensors and keeps going technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer this one burning question that manufactuers have face when dealing with driverless cars the seniors the automatic brakes accelerate system decides one day just does not want drive itself any more and the human driver not able get back control who fault the human driver the manufacturer the driver should not have worried about this happening especially they are new drivers new teenage drivers not mention the nervous cautious drivers heads display such displays can turned off instantly when the driver needs take over something not available divers trying text with cell phone this where danger comes you are your driverless car and some people might think that the car control not need steer break anytime soon all will just check messages this happens and the heads display does not give any type heads and the sensors the automatic driving system instantly stops accident waiting happen although driverless cars may sound new and exciting able have there always downsides that dealerships fail explain which recipe for something bad driverless cars need alot more work and saftey hazards checked out before any one sets foot inside saftey key the roads city there should always car match that saftey,3
having driverless cars would nice because maximizes our safety agree because not only does help but can prevent accidents driverless cars can help our community driverless cars can fundamentally change our world like sergey brin said also would great have new technology this world cars right now are pretty safe but having driverless cars can make this world safer for example you accidentally fall asleep while driving who going help you now you have driverless cars can help you not fall asleep drive while you rest for bit can also help you precautious there another car behind you there something when you are going back people has tested cars that drive independently under specific conditions and has not caused any accidents far driverless cars can very helpful one reason because helps you more relaxed can also helpful when you have kid the back and you need watch them plus won stressful drive you can just sit and watch the view you ever get lost driverless car can help you find your way home driverless cars can also help older people sometimes you have have give your baby bottle but you can leave the wheel then the baby starts crying and that could cause distraction and cause accident with the driverless cars can make life easier and help you out they can also save you some money not going past the speeded limit which can also prevent more speeding tickets driverless cars can helpful when your are just learning how drive too they could also help when your driving night driverless cars can change our community would kind different get used not driving but would fun too you get able different stuff while driving driving can fun but sometimes you also get tired whenever you get tired you can change autopilot plus would benefit lot more people,3

venus planet that our solotar system its our second planet from the sun yes there are lot dangers but been wanting closer want get know better venus called evening star but why that they say that its the brightest light the evening night venus sometimes referred earth twin because venus close the earth meaning density and size and with distance you might already know earth venus and mars are our our neighbor the orbit sun but with different speeds sometimes closer mar venus depletes alot people have tried visit venus but couldn make they unmanned because they knew was dangor there are thick atmosphere almost carbon dioxide blankets venus what made challenging were the clouds highly corrosive the planet surface the temperatures are the average degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than hta live you think that its really hot can burn down anything less than min seconds venus the hottest temperature any other planet that have even mercury closer the sun the sun extremis hot astron are fascinated venus because has been the most earth like planet the solar system venus had have features lieko earth bbt not many like like have oceans they have that too our planet has surface rocky sediment and familiar features like said oceans valleys mountains craters all that nasa been trying hard and they have plan sent humans study venus they rethinking bulding what called blimp like vehicle that was hovering mile above the roiling venusian landscape they want sent study venus but safe easy way with there plan that they got want make sure because temperatures they want thirty miles above the surface they don have touch yes they would degrees fahrenheit but the pressure would closer the sea level earth they might not easy conditions but they are survivable for humans thats the challange exploring venus,3
the automobile was made long time ago help move around faster and more efficient however have really thought about the benefits that could come from limiting the usage cars such saving money gas and insurance less car crash related injuries and even because its better for the enviroment with limiting the usage cars comes many pro such saving money average american spends about thirty five fourty dollars gas per fill and one hundred two hundred dollars month insurance month depending age experience accidents etc limiting your car usage completely even just little just imagine the extra money you have daying around for the necessities and maybe even bittle you time say you buy bike and the only time you use your car drive work and anywhere out state that means that you able week with roughly two gallons gas that puts you about thirty eight hundred dollars year where you were purchasing four five gallons week you spending approximately eleven thousand dollars year thats chump change you insurance would gradually decrease due safe driving and age along with gas being cheaper would the insurance florida state well known for car crashes due weather conditions like rain and fog and you can anything change that other than take different much safer mode transportation such bus nowadays bus and semi truck drivers are more experienced and cautious then they used for one reason cyb cover your butt you see major bus and semi truck companies now that due the size their vehicles there ever crash involving one their automobiles then they likely get blamed cause the size the vehicles and would make since for them send their drivers extensive training and make sure that their trucks are good hands which exactly what they studies show that you chances being wreck bus are one every one hundred rides while being car driven yourself puts you whopping one ten rides chances safety are greatly increased the united states america has shortage pollution and that not helped the fact that have one the largest populations personal automobiles inhabiting this country there are many other kinds pollution that occurs the land the free but most like factory smoke large ship boat smoke and even restuarant made smoke can not really stopped diminished you but one form pollution can prevent automobile smoke the fifty percent greenhouse gas from cars certain areas you stop using you car and ride bike even though won seem like mucyo suprised the difference say sall community around yur neighborhood gives their cars that could account for half percent greenhouse gas which more than seems just ask yourself you want your friends and family growing dying polluted world conclusion not discrediting the huge help cars can our daily lives just saying continue along this car orientated path pollution may what ends our daily lives,4

think shouldn able have technology read are emotions dont want the artifical its does computer model your face and they didnt get all the emotions that everyone might have like some people have derrickson and some might have the reeking blah but you guys wouldnt know because you dont have that oppositon there they talk about how home cant handle the complex algorithms used decode someone simile think that should make where matter what you use can run with out having write down what someone fake smiling your technology going able tell your really happy not think not good idea because one doesnt tell you all the emotions that the person feeling and what the person doesnt want one doesnt like and they aloud get rid they have keep know wouldnt want someone else tell emotions surely dont want some technology telling how feel,2
the future technology always increasing the standard phone that you carry around today has more speed and processing power than the apollo spaceship computer with these new technological capabilities the progression toward new era transportation seems inevitable and entirely possible that are advances will progress much faster than the legal regulations themselves there are many reasons why autonomous cars will present challange both from technology standpoint and legal point view however would maintain that this just the simple nature enlightenment advancement and that indeed possible then should allow move forward right now the technology exists which would allow driverless cars the road and probably work just fine the time the goverment legal system set motion for corporations allow these vehicles market once the demand increases will the technology itself the one thing that almost definitely clear that based the assumption that almost all the technology acheive this feat already place the question not much will acheive its when more specifically how quickly can law makers decide reasonable way regulate and allow the technology move forward after all the advantages such endevor would incredible especially were implemented national scale for example over time could get the point that autonomous cars could reach level sophistication would allow the computer systems communicate with other cars allowing them perdita and avoid collisions all together there would also need for setting speed limits roads which would divert public resources much more useful endevor mentioned the article there may not even any need for many people even own cars this would probably the case many cities where new market system would place where people could simply lease cars out for the day and the car could return itself back the shop there would also little liability the user the car because the software would have complete control over the system the time however this does raise some interesting problems especially for the manufacturer and the legal system after all accident does occured who liable for there are also some interesting ethical and philosophical questions that could raised for example driverless car placed situation where accident unavoidable and its given choice between either having collision with party which one should choose the only way save group people make manuever which will almost certainly kill the driver should the car make that manuever the other hand not doing would almost certainly guarantee the drivers safety but would possibly kill people the process yes there are still some questions that may not yet have good answer for however would maintain that the benefits this new enterprise far otway any cost,4

dear state senator currently the electoral college makes the final decision who should elected president some people may think otherwise but believe that should change the election popular vote for the president the united states america the electoral college they don vote for the president also unfair voters and the disaster factor begin with think that should change the election popular vote for the president the united states america because the electoral college doesn even vote for the president the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defense the system are wrong bradford plumer states instead they vote for slate electors who turn elect the president you lived texas for instance and wanted vote for john kerry you vote for slate democratic electors pledged kerry moving think that should change the election popular vote for the president the united states america because the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning focusing only the tight races the swing states during the campaign seventeen states didn see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markese didn get see single campaign last but not least think that should change the election popular vote for the president the united states america because the electoral college disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and that those,2
the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents because the planet itself dangerous venus the same the earth mean refered earth twin but there both the same only because the density and size both planets have the same shape and density but planet earth much more safer than venus venus has thick atmosphere makes harder breathe for example the text says thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere impossible for somone even live venus because own atmosphere exploring and studying the planet venus actually challenging when you think about people tried study about the planet people have tried explore but the end ends failing for example the text states since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite its proximity this explaining how bad the planet really spacecraft can even touch the ground planet venus the reason why spacecraft has touched down planet venus because the clouds itself for example the text explains the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet venus has temperature degrees fahrenheit while earth highest temperature least degrees planet venus very hot that probably explains why spacecraft can land the planet because hot the planet that the clouds trap all that heat inside conclusion these are the reasons why the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents,2
the date may and twenty five years ago found something that left both nasa and speechless they say that this face was created aliens however they are totally wrong nasa says otherwise that just natural landform the most logical reason the natural landform because haven had any evidence aliens being real therefore argue that its just natural landform and not any form made alien first all have proof aliens whatsoever one has proved that they exist that they are real why they think its aliens when could just been natural landform things like these happen all the time our earth just happens make things like these people are actually believing that aliens are real when really they don have proof second all how would the aliens know how create say they even are real how would they create there aren any tools mars they wouldn know what they were making they would have idea the face just happened natural landform was not created aliens along with they have proof aliens did this third all why would they even this they did happen they didn even mean too because they haven seen face they wouldn know how make aliens are not real they were everywhere all over the news people would excited and although going space risk many people would just see the aliens but one has proved they are real therefore nasa will stand correctly the face just natural landform conclusion nasa correct there proof aliens and even there was the slightest chance having proof aliens wouldn even have meant they have never seen face why would they just this natural landforms happen all the time but this one just happened spotted nasa nasa always seems correct their stats because they much research unlike the other who just suggest that its alien like see you much research nasa and give proof aliens then believe you,3
venus very dense and very thick with carbon dioxide and because none our spacecrafts can reach venus because the extreme temperatures degrees fahrenheit also can melt our spaceships like its nothing has volcanoes earthquakes lighting because all this our scientists can not get through the cloud carbon dioxide and study moon rocks and the surface venus for nasa they are creating new ways for get venus and hopefully land the surface maybe get moon rock two they even are thinking about how long will our powerful machines will stay the planets atmosphere but our spacecrafts should made strong enough get close enough the surface and get some pictures and then those pictures will sent back nasa for further investigations for about how can see the past and history venus and thats why will able get close venus can,1
driverless cars are making break across the world cars have changed much since first invented these driverless cars are just now getting popular although first invented from google these cars have driven thousands miles without crashing but could crash coming soon with them becoming ever popular the developement these cars going the change the world for the better the idea driverless cars would not the rise unless the idea safety was presented the world safety major topic discussed with these cars according the article there are now ways that driver can basically become passenger the car but still able take over the car when needed there are seats that will vibrate when the car backing but close object these vibrations are meant alert the driver that they need take over the wheel and control the car again matter what the driver will still control the car with safety being concern many the idea drivers not paying attention while the car also concern according the text the newly innovated car will feature flashing lights when the driver needs take over according the text they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills this example from the text explains that these cars are only going helping the driver the driver must stay alert during the driving process though safety always going concern this car but and other car manufacturing companies are taking the necessary precautions ensure that the future cars are still going safe the new car going have several safety features according the text one the safety feature are heads displays that appear the windshield that need turned off immediately this heads will pop and you arent paying attention the road then will not turned off soon should according the article this feature considered safety feature which big concern although safety seems important with these cars there are some ways that manufactuers are inventing that may unappealing car buyers the article states manufactuers are also considering using cameras watch that drivers are remaining focused the road while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver this can seem very creepy for some drivers they might not find very pleasing that someone going watching them every second that they are their car this single factor could the reason why many people might not purchase driverless car although there seems long list safety features for the new driverless car there are small features that could stand between buying leaving with vibrating seats pop ups that need turned off immediately google audi nissan and others companies are taking the necessary precautions when developing the new driverless car,4

one article say dose your expression the mirro suggest emotion this talks about how yeasayer would know how others feal think may actually bad because some people like not have there privacy invaded other normal people using computer people like keep there personal thoughts them selves don like the idea reading peoples mines should not this because might make things yeasayer the same time harder don think technology will make things yeasayer nader what there will always trouble the article supporting this claim because they are curios and think things would yeasayer with this new machine they can use detect the dealings old paintings like the mona lisa and they can use peole too they want use this for students they think would help with there difficulties don like this because too like spying somebody think should only use this for paintings like the mona lisa but not people who are still alive this would make people uncomfortable this like invading someones privacy and being rude even when disagree with this people will still use all because they are curious think should only used for certain things not for school anything else,2
dear state senator would rather want the changing the election popular vote because the electoral college process causes many problems first that consists electors and only electoral votes required elect the president source also perhaps leads into tie the electoral votings could possibly lead into deadlocked election source this process electoral college does not give the full rights the voters its not fair first reason why you guys should change the election popular votes causes many problems electors consisted and only electoral votes required elect the president this tells that people can vote which really does not give you the right that because people have always that right vote addition that can lead big catastrophe the electoral college process unfair voters also why all that can lead into tie the electoral votings which equals into deadlocked election lastly this process outdated and irrational arguments against direct elections are spurious and should completely vanish this process,2
how you feel about driverless cars position driverless cars don think good ide because could potentially very dangerous for anyone inside outside the car could cause lot problems the court rooms you think safe for children sit the cars themselves driverless car was get into wreck who are you judge the car the individual believe driverless cars could very dangerous because the text states they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues eyes and how read that makes bilevel they couldn drive was raining hard traffic literally almost everywhere the individual the car would have take over most the time ithier way the car can driverless because notifies you everything the second reason bilevel that driverless cars should thing because there was accident who would responsible for the accident the manufactory the individual the car that could cause lot problems the court room could for months like especially was drunk driver that start riot,2
thick foggy air the future for this planet continue this polluting path although pollution unavoidable the industrial time all live there are still ways people may help limit the amount pollution with this information the people the earth need limit their use cars for benefiting reasons such decreasing the deadly pollution the lessening stress and economically saving initially pollution increasing drastically and limiting car use will help decrease the usual effects pollution from car the exhaust lets out also the factories that manufacture these cars are letting off smoke which result pollutes the air people breath source paragraph explains that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and fifty percent some surburban countries such the united states therefore the result cars exhaust hurting the enviroment and one the main causes greenhouse gases source paragraph also states the cold nights and warm nights caused the warmer layer air trap car emissions explaining the air families and children breath basically coming form car exhaust overall pollution catastrophe and affects everyone dramatically additionally the stress the average person can and will lowered the use cars decrease stress can cause many things but one those things the use cars limiting the use cars will really help any person relax source paragraph heidrun walter media trainer and mother two states she has been less tense and much happier futher more without the use car this mother feels relaxed which enables her the mothe she wants source paragraph explains that leaving the streets this capital city eerily devoid traffic jams knowing how stressful traffic jam can limiting the use car will avoid that stress conclude the streets relief limiting the use car will impact everyone very beneficial way lastly there economic benefit limiting the use car car cost alot maintain and with all these expenses its hard find money spend ones self source paragraph explains the car use decreasing america was caused recession the cash strapped americans had hard time finding the money spend cars which explains cars are very expensive product overall the economic impact will beneficial everyone because the money saved used for different amenities sum the limiting use cars wont only help relieve stress save money but also help decrease pollution everyone would then able live life knowing their childrens future will bright instead full with smog and smoke,5
has there ever been time where you looking your classwork homework were the worlds most difficult equation this new technology facs amazing program that recognizes facial expressions and wild more than helpful our schools personally think that this technology bridge better understanding this new technology would help teachers know what students need help would cause test scores and grades rise and would great advancement school technology first there has been many times where you don understand problem material and you don say anything maybe was because you were too shy the teacher instructor had already reviewed many times this technology could help students get the help they need teachers will know when students are having trouble and when they are ready move second the students got the help they needed and started understand more grades and test scores would our education would start advance more and more our graduates would much more skilled and instructed would have much more offer our country and citizens would recognized for our high test scores and good grades would offering much better education than any other country our students would actually understand the what being presented them third our technology our schools would much more advanced the future going full technology and should know how use and control technology has its pros and cons but will able help much more than will hurt will have access easier and faster ways learning facs one those easier and faster ways facs would help greatly helping teachers know what students need help increasing test scores and grades and advancing our schools technology truly believe this program should all schools becasue this will help educate the youth that will building better future for,4
should there autonomous cars the world today that the big question that many people have opinion have some thoughts that may seem wrong right some people but that just every other person perspective this subject most certainly interesting one this could big deal the years come for the united states kids today could have future that would such opportunity them autonomous cars seem have good meaning evolving technology today just how helpful would for people these cars were allowed every state what would make people want buy them and use them instead regular reliable cars people today are dependent technology insane don get wrong these cars could big deal some day but when that day don know could say that the day today seems like they could have positive outcome the world but what would make them stand out what would make them something that unbelievable and that everyone would want don see the world changing this much dramatically maybe couple years think that could major idea would make more sense have some more experience and develope the software and technology the cars before making them product that people would buy and have the roads more things need developed and more thoughts need into the idea make more reliable for people when they start sell them laws need made roads need safe people need aware everything needs upgrade order make this project successful there are many ways interpret this concept but this the way that did other people will take the meanings this idea different ways and that fine everyone has their own may look things and understand the ways that things happen the world today hope that this idea works someday but not sure today the day,3

kaitlyn scientist nasa since the year there has been many people trying figure out what the face mars but more importantly how did the face get there did aliens was just blur the picture through the years people have been trying figure out this mistry can assure you that was not aliens since the year were able get better and clearer photos march one our mars surveyor flew over the face for the first time michael marlin took picture ten times better than the original image thought that would for sure clear all the alien talk the image showed natural landform but that didn satisfy everyone the picture was taken during cloudy time mars since the camera had look through clouds skeptics said alien marking were hidden haze once again media was talking about how there still possibility that the landform was created something not our world were thuburn prove them wrong not easy but tried again april had another chance soon marlins team captured extraordinary photo now they used camera even more high tech than before you could see the details the photo this time the photo was taken clear day studied the photo here nasa and you can clearly see the photo landform much like butte mesa which are often found the american west thanks the upgraded technology you can clearly see just ordinary land form,3
think facial action coding system should used the classroom read students emotions most students wouldnt want there there emotions being read its like evading privacy ones thoughts and course emotion huang says that the classroom the facs could determine ones emotion being confused bored but wouldnt also try read other emotions well thats not exactly fair the students you couldnt rely working right anyway student actually upset they could put smile ther face and the computer would read happy another claim what students refuse school because the facs what the student wants left alone and the teacher could start criticizing them for not paying attention being distracted bored that wouldnt exactly help anything for the student emotionally although she maybe bored depressed and not really paying attention they could just having bad day week and facs evading there emotions think that facs should not used the classroom but ore like for military purposes they could used police investigations not for students the classroom students are confused they should the ones make there mind and ask questions,3
think driverless car are cool and should thing the future because will better for the environment people will longer get lost accidents the road will thing the past the first reason why think driverless cars should thing will lot better for the environment the article said the driverless car will use half the fuel the cars have now with todays technology already have cars that use less fuel think how much less fuel the driverless car will use second reason people will longer get lost people always have trouble getting place place they don how get and always end lost well that situation will solved when driverless cars are thing because all you really have sit the car and relax and the gps will the rest the work for you last but not least accidents probably won thing after driverless cars are thing humans are not perfect and will make lot mistakes computers are lot better than not making mistakes and probably better avoiding them well why not just let the sensors the cars its thing and just sit back and relax you can tell really want driverless cars thing the near future can use less fuel and save the environment not have worry about getting lost and finally never get into accidents,3
driverless cars are inevitable result advancements technology has been estimated that within the next years most cars the world will self operated the idea driverless car sounds absurd some but driverless cars might better that modern cars driverless cars are amazing invention that will revolutionize the world driverless cars will safer that regular cars when driverless cars advance the point that they can operate without human intervention the cars will operate without error humans are imperfect human has perfect judgement computer program running the car will make less errors that human driverless cars will cheaper than modern cars our techology advances the cost new technology will decrease the baticle mentioned that radar small enough fit car cost two hundred million dollars radar today costs fraction that since techology advancing previously new technologies are becoming cheaper this will make driverless cars more affordable driverless cars will cleaner that modern cars the technology withing the car will allow plan the most fuel efficient routes and use less fuel this will lead smaller carbon footprint per car smaller carbon footprint per car will drastically lower the total carbon emmissions the world driverless cars will reality within few years the potential for errorless clean and cheap alternatives modern cars something should strive for with driverless cars that future not much concept but inevitable reality that will change the world for the better,3
today technology classrooms huge almost all classrooms use technology nearly everyday however not everyone them effective because they are easier slack off without having human tell them continue even after they are bored tired and even confused thomas huang decided create system help with this problem made system called facs facial action coding system this system computer reads emotions that displayed peoples face there are major muscles the human face each one these muscles helps researchers find new ways read emotions thomas huang one these researchers huang says the facial expressions for each emotion are universal means this that because there are many different muscles your face and them all being able show different emotions there endless amount expressions made for example you can probably read your friends face and see what kind day they are having reading the emotion their face unlike the smart facial action coding system are not able completely describe each facial trait showed our friend although can still tell their state emotion for example when using facs researchers were able tell that leonardo vinci renaissance painting mona lisa was happy disgusted fearful and angry thought that the facial action coding system facs could help students better the classroom classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored chaung predicted also stated that the facs could recognize taht students faces could also modify the lesson like effective human instructor would huang also states most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication even though this system could prove effective not all students are only learning computers and are learning verbally from teacher teacher unable identify the exact percent each emotion you feel but can still read your emotions just your friend would nick alto the author making mona lisa smile gives example demonstration could try while looking the mirror raise your lips the corners your mouth then squint your eyes slightly produce wrinkling crow feet the corners your eyes holding that raise the outer parts your cheeks toward your eyes having partner guess which emotion your are portraying doing the facs would your partner probably would have guessed happy the computers would have been able tell that you are feeling happy and continue with your work however you were have been looking confused the computer would stop and try help explain the problem you the computers could very easily help the classrooms make students work the best their ability being able read emotions the computers will make harder for students slack off while previously would have been moderately easy humans perform these face calculations everyday without realizing now the facs system can join along with and then some creating better work environnement for the students,3
this article about driverless cars feel could problem having cars the roads that isnt operated actual person there could end being problem with the driverless cars they arent ready but the developers dont know problem has occurred til its out the roads would think that the developers would wait for awhile just make sure that nothing major could happen with the car whenever out the roads and hopefully wont cause damage some people might fascinated with cars that could drive themselves but could dangerous because without human operating the vehicle could crash and damage our community some positive reasons for having driverless cars that would easier and better for people have them movies they have driverless cars which people think are really cool they have driverless cars the future and something goes wrong they have sensors that the driver knows there problem and they have drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger which great thing have especially you almost back into object another car using driverless car could also new way actually make driving vehicle fun the driverless car developers wait for another years having them the road would better and much safer because the more time they spend working them the better will and the less problems and damage there will also before didnt have the mapping sensors computers but now that should spend more time try fix the issues that they have you use mapping driverless car might not work well you might think because what would you gets the address wrong and ends taking you the wrong place gps arent always the best use because they might have relocate all the time which could mess everything,3
possible make driverless car the guarantees one hundred percent saftey for the passengers the peoples focus should not driverless cars the idea car being able drive around with having control over should greatly scare everyone there telling the car will malfunction breakdown have any other problems only diver could recognize will have control over the vehicle but any problems occur with will still our fault car that could drive itself can cubase many hazardous problems for anyone around possibly boring for the people there are laws that are meant keep people who are allowed drive cars safe most driving laws focus keeping drivers passangers and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety best achieved with alert drivers says the article driverless cars are coming this quote saying that drivers who are more alert are lesser prone accidents and breaking driving laws how can driver alert cars drive themsleves the future presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times result most states illegal even test computer driven cars true that most states illegal test drive cars for safety reasons and concerns these states are trying keep the people safe and not allowing self driven cars there are facts that prove that beltdriven cars are not bad idea and people have been working moring them for years some people are really looking forward into the future where there are driverless cars google has been working since create such car that would change the world google has been testing out such cars see what they can improve them their cars have driven more than half million miles without crash according the article driverless cars are coming they have even packed the car with sensors help detect problems other companies are also the race create the first working driverless car and some have seen very good success rates there are others who have seen the negative side having these cars around now the driverless cars sound easy work people can just lay back and enjoy peaceful ride the truth that that not completely correct the article driverless cars are coming states the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over that means still have alert for situations the car can not handle who would want sit car having stare the road but not anything enjoy the ride nobody should have subjected that these new driverless cars not sound very driverless fun cars that can drive themsleves don sound very safe even fun these cars have been worked for many years now and there telling when one will finished most states have already passed laws forbidding even test these cars why should the people allowed even drive one there good reason behind this becasue they want keep safe these cars could have problems that can not detect becasue are not control them should carefully evaluate these cars before ever decided get into one,4

with the information that has been found there prove that the face has been structured aliens scientist have stated that the face was form natural causes others say that they may have found more information about the face but than what they are saying the face was made natural landform not created aliens the face wasn structured aliens therefore was made natural landform nasa has plenty evidence that the face was form naturally for example that hasn really been discovered that aliens actually exist throught the years and there were pictures the face not yet completely form therefore scientist think took years form completely others may say that nasa has more information than what they are telling for instants the article unmasking the face mars paragraph states that evidence that nasa would rather hide argue that the face wasn created aliens but from natural landforms natural landforms created aliens one will actually really know what they think think was naturally formed not created aliens there really real evidence about created aliens there could thousand possibilites that was form naturally created aliens there are plenty reasons believe that was natural causes but not much being created aliens after all who doesn love good mystery,3
the face that nasa found mars was not made aliens the mars global surveyor flew over cydonia and got better pictures than the viking did and showed that there was alien monument was just natural landform the picture shows the martian equivalent butte mesa which are landforms common around the american west lastly the picture that the viking took was not very good quality compared the pictures took one reason that the face mars was not made aliens because the mars global surveyor got the best picture and just turned out natural landform line says that rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size also added there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were another reason that the face was not made aliens that the face the equivalent butte mesa which are landforms common around the american west paragraph compares the face mars the snake river plain idaho the snake river plain idaho lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa that about the same height the face mars the pictures that the mars global surveyor took were lot more clearer than the pictures took the viking paragraph says that malin team captured amazing picture using the camera absolute maximum resolution each pinal the photo spans meters compared meters per pinal the best viking photo this proves how bad the quality was the photo taken the viking also proves that was not good photo and that the photo shows much more and way better quality other people might say that the photo taken the chimaera board the mgs had pear through wispy clouds see the face which made the alien markings hidden the haze then the picture proved that there was alien markings and that the face was just landform conclusion this why believe that the face mars was not made aliens and just natural landform first all the mars global surveyor got better quality pictures than the viking did also the picture shows that the face the equivalent mesa butte which are landforms that are common the american west lastly when you compare the and the picture side side you can tell that the and the pictures are more clear and show that the face just landform,5
the face just natural landform yes the face mars just gigantic rock formed shadows paragraph say rock that resembled head shows illusion eyes nose and mouth making look like something actually not nasa has all the evidence prove that their isn face the planet mars but just regular landform some people were unsatisfied and some was with the conclusion nasa came with involving the face mars others thought perhaps the alien markings were hidden haze paragraph garvin stated not that easy target cydonia also said fact hard work people were ungrateful with the answers that were given them nasa had through too much trouble hit them with more evidence again conclusion would like say that nasa was percent right when they said was only landform there was three pictures taken from years with the years and people absolutely believed that their was face our planet mars but more people was convinced there was face mars but landform like nasa have been telling them paragraph its says there was alien monument after all the picture shows the martian equivalent butte mesa butte mesa landforms common around the american west much people may think mars have face all know that does not the question everyone wanted know the face just natural landform took citizens years finally say yes the question even though unmasking the face mars was very disappointing people eventually got over,3

there are lot advantages when comes limiting car usage car ownerships are allowed but there are only two places park cars owners have buy space the thousands that means you are spending more money then you should having car lot worry about the gas and car notes and things like that were you didn have car would less stress you passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emissions stores have placed walk ways main streets inform people that walking better then just getting car the private cars owned the middle class are choking the cities this problem wont much longer the environmental protection agency promoting car reduced lot cars drive once will produce air problems just like the one paris they have ban driving clear the air the global city was law everyone had follow they would fined dollars your car could impounded also china the cold nights and warm days makes layer air trap which causes car emissions which why are sounded smog but paris has more smog than china some places like bogota colombia have days called car free day where they could not use their cars thre hole day they took buses biked skated hiked work its good way take away stress and lower air pollution but this act didnt just start the mid will good thing not have cars for day then everyone would getting space even the ones that don wont you really look recent studies show that americans are buying fewer cars and not many people are getting their licenses the years maybe driving isn all cracked the end you think about owning car little stress all the things you have make sure your car have just you can keep the road and sometimes you also have put lot money into car get fix maybe not having car not bad thing anymore just think about and you tell,3
the time for the automobile slowly passing more and more people prefer carpooling and walking then driving car why that could due the unemployment rate skyrocketing less people wanting car there are many benefits driving car being able get point point faster travel time and more private than bus but what are the downsides pollution more antisocial humans and the cacophony horns and engines giving the car should every countries list some nations such paris france find out about the downside cars the hardway pollution very real problem todays society the city had near record high pollution rivaling beijing china the most polluted city the world source after debating the french ruling party decided ban driving for odd and even licence plate numbers opposite days until the smog count went down took five days but they managed have most the smog cleared decisions like these cause controversy everywhere but have responsibility our planet not destroy with greenhouse gases suburb germany they have car free neighborhood they are allowed own cars but costs and they can only park the edge the neighborhood this alone caused the neighborhood not own cars source woman vauban the neighborhood said that not owning car makes her less tense and more happy with this you can conclude that most her neighbors feel this way also otherwise they wouldn have moved there having less stressed people less polluted airways and less car accidents always sounds like good solution city columbia they have car free day where cars are banned from the city source even though was rainy did not stop people from participating all fact has even spread across its borders businessman said this was good way lower stress aswell without cars this city has seen more bikeway paths parks and community centers being built and rush hour traffic being cut down dramatically this new trend has promoted people more healthy and social not only has this affected the airs has affected business with more people walking new restaurants and shopping centers have cropped having more and more people spending their money helps their nations economy great ways after all this evidence the only conclusion can come that having less cars would help humans immensely not only does promote physical exercise but but cuts down pollution yes would have hurt car manufacturers but the businessmen don exactly just lay down and take bill ford has already suggested working with the new trend source without cars the obesity problem especially america would decrease well the number asthmatic people taking this data and doing something with would not only help the life living this planet but would help the planet too,4
driverless should not manufactured because they are run computers they can dangerous and they are unrealizable all driverless cars are run computers computers can realizable because most are due malfunction fry the very least they use sensors view the surroundings the car wont run into anything but what the sensors don catch something and the driver goes flying into ditch hitting the car infonet him with conspires goverment spying people nowadays this just giving them even easier way doing with all the cameras and computers the manufactures use also with how easy for people hack into computers and softwares today just imagine someone hacking into drivers car and either killing him using him for something driverless cars can very dangerous when malfunctions driver would have control over the car and could end driving off bridge into oncoming traffic what the driver falls asleep the wheel and the car can wake him time for him around construction right through this also just makes easier for people drive drunk underage kids driving undetected just causing dangers happen the driver and everyone around him since the driverless cars are run computers they are less realizable one simply does not solidly realise just their phone store all their photos and music they will back with their computer you can that with car person can just realise driverless car pick them time someone decide chainage where they want mid route computers simply can not trusted humans job overall againt the development driverless cars this comes happen soon people will expect things halep them learn then that leads not gong school anymore and then just making even more stupid people famous even making people more lazy than they already are how bad that they are lazy that they can even drive their own car driverless cars are run solely computers they are dangerous and unrealizable which shows they should not manufactured does the really want known the laziest and dangerous country earth,3
the author defends the claim that the exploration venus worthy pursuit however believe that this statement not proven very efficiently although the author refers nasa and the experiments they carried out the information just does not sufficiently back the statement that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the author continuously describes the challenge would for humans carry out the study venus from space well using terms that convey the assumptions she making based his her opinion many risks would taken order physically explore venus with this information mind believe the author did not support the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers order for mankind study the cloud draped world they would have undergo much training even prepared come near venus and its harsh conditions stated the text the conditons the planet are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth even with advanced technology that have today the article states that spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the technology have today can even survive the conditions venus how are humans supposed able even though the author claims the conditions are not easy but survivable for humans the temperature can climb over degrees fahrenheit these pieces evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans even near addition venus extreme conditions the challenge collecting physical evidence from the planet would extremely difficult well even though humans could possibly hover miles above the ground level the texts states that the vast distance would provide only limited insight ground conditions and would render standard forms photography and videography ineffective along with that the author admits that researchers would not able take samples from distance the challenge that the study provides would simply not worth the time money and risks man were extreme lengths reach within miles planet and not able collect and evidence data would not successful mission the goal was obtain new information about the planet moreover the author word choice contributes the idea that his her claim not very well supported when examining the similarities between earth and venus the author uses the word probably saying that venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the word probably gives off the impression that the author making assumption about the fact that venus could support life just like earth based common feature between the two planets dangerous make assumptions about subjects such this because would very costly turned out incorrect the end after considering both sides this controversial claim believe the author did not support the claim that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers although the author referred the study being beneficial man sense imagination and innovation simply just too dangerous the author repeatedly describes the challenge would for humans carry out the study venus from space well word choice that conveys the assumptions she makes based their own knowledge many risks would taken order physically explore venus and believe the dangers could more costly than the knowledge gained through the experience believe the author did not support the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers,6

cars our society has been beneficial invention that had now that are living the century people are worried about the negative effects that cars are contributing limit the use cars takes away stress from drivers reduces air pollution and avoids many traffic jams have daily basis although life can hard without cars their are several other ways get around without harming our environment one option should take into consideration walking little excercise doesn harm anyone why that since have cars one really walks anymore the human population walked can add stress one the main things you get while driving you constant fear people crashing into you running red light running out gas the middle the highway street thw whole concept driving stressful enough for and don even drive yet limit the use cars our community reduces lot unecessary stress the first source talks about german residency where cars aren permitted and you own car you can choose buy space for which costs vauban german residency home residents and only few them own car this approach stores are placed walk away main street rather than malls along some distant highway the thought having one main street where everyone can access all they need genius idea becuase basically forces people walk and reduces the use cars which lowers stress shouldn stress about cars becuase owning car isn right privee monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered leave their cars home suffer euro fine source number two states that the reason why this did this paris was because intense smog,3
driverless cars may very interesting and cool have but are they truly furthering the betterment people over all the new technology used order full develop this driverless car will cost large amounts money the united states focuses too much this development the economy will suffer there are may aspects considered about the idea autonomous vehicle developing these cars will enable laziness for people establishing maybe unsafe conditions for pedestrians and creating way for people not have learn how drive even though being able have car that drives itself would cool would allow people rely machines their work for them americans are some cases are seen lazy and these cars will further show that the driver still the car paying attention but they are not truly focused papon maiming sure turn correctly not going over the speed limit driving car can teach people how discipline how focus and how aware their surroundings these fundamentals would not fully understood the driverless cars were developed further also this new technology cars could create safety risk for rohter drivers pedestrians and bicyclists there potentially could larger number accidents with these new cars for example the cars not programmed aware incoming bicyclists pedestrians there could problem with stopping the car time avoid collisions driving good skill have but these cars develop people will feel there not much use learning the specifics driving techniques the car drives itself driver still should know the importance driving even the car able run its own this means tahta the drivers the future will not need learn major parts driving because the cars will mainly all the work cars without drivers development that could create more accidents allow people lazy and cause there not reason for people not learn the skills driving the cars may useful many ways because the driver still must attentive the road there really point having car the supposed drive itself the person the car basically still driving these cars take away learning opportunities form upcoming driver well driverless cars seem great development but all reality having cars that need driver more beneficial,3
people today and years before have always wandered there has been life mars with one photo taken mysterious figure people think they have come closer than ever knowing there was life long before another planet unmasking the face mars topic commonly talked about some say the face was created aliens while others say the natural landform that caused pictures were taken and conclusion have been made whether not aliens created was caused natural landform viking was orbiting mars find landing space for their sister ship viking while scouting out mars viking comes across image that could likely show life mars the pictured appeared face but was debated for long time couple years later the mars global surveyor mgs took shot the face which revealed natural landform the image shot was ten times shaper and more clear than the one taken once the second picture was taken was released the jpl web site showing all that was caused natural landforms and that aliens were not the case people began say that the aliens were hidden haze since the camera was taken with had zoom through the clouds order take the shot the people needed specific evidence believe that aliens not exist the mgs did just that prove all the people third picture was taken the mgs the image was shot with the most powerful resolution showed the mysterious figure mars turned out butte mesa these were landforms command the american west with the high quality picture now know that life mars never existed and the called face was formed over time natural landforms,2
what cars were never invented what cars were much money one will able buy them limiting the usage cars can help the economy and help the environment many ways places like germany paris and bogota have banned the usage cars they say that since they have did that congestion the cities have gone down polluted cities aren crowded they use since they have banned the usage cars vauban germany one the places that has banned the usage cars you can still own car but there are only two places park your car large garages the end development buy pspace along with home article one stated that more than percent vauban familias not own cars and percent sold their car move here people siad that having car was tense and kind too much pressure when crowded city vauban had become example growing trend europe vauban home residents within square mile they have been the most advanced experiment low car usage stores are placed the walk away main street rather than malls distant highway paris have near record pollution they enforced partial driving ban the clear some the air the global city motorists with even and odd numbered license plates were ordered leave thier cars home they suffer and fine euros around drivers were fined and twenty sevin people had thier cars impounded because their reaction the fine congestion was down nearly percent the capital france after five days after the enforcement the driving fine since paris has generally more smog than other european capitals diesel feal was blamed for diesel fuel makes percent vehicles france delivery companies complained about the lost revenue for cars maricle two siad public transportation was free charge from friday monday the smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party rescind the ban for odd numbered car plates tuesday bogota columbia have banned usage cars for three years straight cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day thier goal promote alternative transportation and reduce smog anybody that violated that suffered fine dollars maricle businessman carlos arturo plaza said good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution meaning that cutting down car usage with lower the greenhouse gases the air and clear dyas without cars part improvement campaign that began bogota the mid has been the construction miles bicycle paths the most any latin american city parks and sport centers and have buli throughout the city pitted sidewalks have been replaced with smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have cut traffic dramatically new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped banning cars bogota has been the best thing that has ever happened the city president obama had ambitious goals curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions recent studies have shown that many americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses the years article said that april the number miles driven per person was nearly percent below the peak and equal where the country was january part that because many americans could not afford new cars and the unemployed weren going work anyway demographic shifts the driving population have made the trend banning car accelerate conclusion banning cars will successful rate not just the united states but the world maybe people should actually look and promote the idea see will help our economy and environment without cars polluted cities will able breath fresh air and won have worry about payin for gas banning cars could the best thing that will happen the world,2
mars has many landforms but there particular one that peculiar the landform known the face the face was spotted space surveyor and has been mystery the world ever since some people say that this landform was made alien life mars but with facts from nasa and other sources you could see that those people are wrong the face has had many theories made about how was made and even real one these theories about how who created this theory about how nasa hiding the fact that the face was made some type alien lifeform which logically makes sense all finding life another planet would bring gargantuan amount money for nasa would seem completely illumined hide something like this from the people nasa can only wish they knew about alien lifeform with this new discovery people and scientists demanded for more proof how was made throughout the knowing this landform three pictures were taken the first pictures was when they first found and camera quality was not very good with not clear image and the need for answers nasa sought out for another picture and got one during cloudy winter day this picture did come out clearer than the other but still was not perfect for scientist and people one hundred percent sure how was made the wait began get another picture finally two thousand one nasa used new high resolution three dimensional camera take outstanding clear photo what they concluded mesa common the american west just with the physical theatres human face conclusion this outstanding land form mars had the world stuck asking this question there alien life mars the face was mystery science for almost thirty years only proven just another landform mars conclude this landform nothing more than naturally occuring lava dome,3
the future coming many new technologies will developed over the next few years and ideas that people have had for decades will finally have the possibility becoming reality flying cars human like robots anything you can possibly imagine could very well introduced into our future although many new problems will arise with these new developments setbacks such driving traffic laws the argument who would fault case accident will only ripple the ocean that our technology these devices should most definitely tested for years come before they even begin release into the population but the end certainly agree that they could furiously enhance our style living and ultimately safety for those around for any these ideas become reality there going have many years testing ahead and many trials and errors but order for the human race move forwards has the past there are always risks and precautions that need taken and warnings that must heed the pass countless lives have been taken the name science and technology and highly doubt that move forwards into our future that will change much people will always struggle further the comfort their living even that means taking from other people makes wonder technology such this actually going beneficial for our society think about the health risks and funding needed for advances such these not mention the threat war from other countries begin realize that maybe will reach point the future where technology will longer beneficial but instead counterproductive the overall wellbeing the world when all the facts are laid before with deceit hidden behind fine print only then will believe that technological advances can only bring good into this world even today becoming more and more apparent that social media and cellphones have altered our way communication longer have outside see people have conversations face face that means that our world has become much smaller yet also much bigger the same time human confrontation may rare thing thirty years maybe even five although and most anyone else enjoy the comfort our technologies and lifestyle right now there will most definitely come time maybe the near future where regret pushing try make our life easier only time will tell when people begin discover new ways harm others and when that time comes will regret ever pushing this far,3
limiting car usage can very helpful not only our environment but our culture our ozone slowly getting worse and worse every year heavy contributor the decay the ozone layer the greenhouse gasses like the ones emit from our cars daily basis society without cars could create safer more time friendly and environmentally healthy community think all the tragedies that have spawned from car crashes just this year our local community year old boy was knocked off our local bridge and killed drunk driver our city still recovering from this not day goes where don see new person leaving flowers his spot the bridge society without cars this would never have happen again think all the potential lives that could saved think about how much time you spend car the average day least minutes hour you school job sport didnt have drive everywhere everything needed would compacted into walking distance life would much easier you didnt have stress about getting early enough catch the bus for your friend mom pick you you could just casually walk out the door and your destination time life without cars could the change that our country needs improved environmental conditions safety improving drastically and your precious time being saved maybe life without cars wouldn great making out but how are ever going know don try this change would for the better and exactly what america needs,3
the use the technolgy read the emotions students the classroom can very useful the use this technology can help improve and better the lessons that the teachers give also this could help the teachers detect and solve emotional problems that the students may have students tend get bored and distracted while the teacher gives lesson this leads the students not retaining the information that they are learning the use this emotion recolonization technology could help direct the boredom where the teacher would able change the lesson further ngage the students the students are more engaged the lesson they are more likely retain the information and score higher their test high school rough time for students unfortunately during this time their life they are going though lot changes and have lot emotions sometimes these emotions cause them make some unhealthy life dissensions which could lead them down the wrong path teachers where able recognize these emotions they could talk these students because isnt always easy reach out for help this could help the students talk about what bothering them and work though this technology does have its cons reading the emotions the students could seen breach their privity not all students want everyone know how they feel and would like keep themselves this could solved making the students sign waver stating that they are okay with having their emotions read the use emotion reading technology could gigantic plus the school system this technology could help solve many problems before they occur this could also improve test scores and the overall well being our students after all only want whats best for them right,4
the uther well supports his idea giving dentals and information like the venus called the evening star the story says that the venus one the brightest point the light the night sky also says that the different speeds means that sometimes are closer mars then other venus earths pervious mission was unmanned maybe this explainers the issues more than three decades think atmosphere the planets surface percent carbon dioxide blankets venus the uther letting know the reader that the challenge exploring venus that their are many dangers that they dont know but that they shouldn worry about them the story says our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and douds but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation the uther tells that nasa working other approaches study venus for example says some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chodas venus back then the those devices were first envisioned and played important role the during the world war one after reading this passage think that the uther did good evaluating his idea venus gave details information and what the devices were used the past and that was used the world war one venus that their are many dangers,2
the book the challenged exploring venus the author suggests that starving venus pursuit despite all the density present the venus has many systems that don know about the planet the venus venus the our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun different speeds nasa are trying studying one particulary compelling idea for sending humans nasa also studying some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such condition venus one the hottest planet sum orbital now the nasa were sending scientific the spaceship learn some other planet what are the different thing from other planet sometime people called venus evening star the one the brightest points light the night sky this years people get lot experience from the venus and learn what they have with those experience they have and then use our earth venus and mars are hottest planet including the orbital our planet and venus planet are many different and also there was lot different thing and weird seen the venus planet the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the scientific travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,1
every living thing planet earth has emotions these emotions have been used since the beginning time express the feelings the people around you however these emotions can deceiving someone could say they are happy when really they are angry upset this where the facial action coding system comes into play the facs software that detects human emotion tracking muscles the face for example when you are happy muscles your face move and when you are sad they move down facs tracks this and calculates your emotions the creators this software prof thomas huang and prof nicu sebe are the leading experts developing better ways for humans and computers communicate there are still some questions surrounding the usefulness facs like what could this software actually used for one the ways facs may used classrooms may sound far fetched but actually facs may the best thing come schools because its flexible learning and the ability read the students the education world teachers are the backbone the infastructure without teachers the whole system would collapse however may hard for one teacher connect with every student individually and make sure they are learning properly they are paying attention this where facs comes the article making mona lisa smile huang talks about facs classrooms more depth classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor with facs every child could essentially have customized lesson plan exactly for their needs this would make children more eager learn because they begin enjoy besides the classroom facs could also used the school elsewhere one the other important areas this could used counseling very hard for anyone tell someone they are sad this especially true when they barely know the person they are talking this can the case for school counselors and the children they are meeting with facs may able help with facs the school could see children are upset scared the school could also see how often these children feel this way when child unhappy scared very unlikely that they are going doing their work full capacity facs could find these children that need help they could helped faster this could also used find children being bullied the child feeling scared around another student child afraid classroom they could helped because facs was able read them facs may even able detect child afraid leaving school with facs like every child school has someone that looking out for them even one else may true that some children might not want people know about this that they may want hide however never healthy hide such strong emotions especially there are people around you willing help with the constant evolution the way learn its not suprising that something like facs was created emotions have been with everything living since the beginning time before facs was suprisingly difficult read these emotions people such crucial part our everyday lives could easily hidden away fake smile theatre tear but now that there facs helping out looks are longer deceiving,5
the author supports his theory going venus worthy pursuit having creative ideas and sources that supply him with evidence back his claim venus has earth like features its extremely hot and its carbon dioxide the article the author claims that venus has earth like features astronomers are fascinated venus because well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters this statment gives details how venus have looked like earth long time ago the article the author claims that venus very hot the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter earth such environment would crash even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquefy many metals this statment the author gives many specific details how venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet our solar system the article the author claims that venus carbon dioxide thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere this statment the author explains venus atmosphere conclusion the author did very good job explaining and education how venus good planet study despite the many dangers has,3
the face was created landform the face well known landmark the planet mars landmark that has caused nasa lot debate the debate was the face created aliens was created natural landform this has caused nasa and many scientists have problems because there are few scientists that believe that the face was created aliens the face was originally discover the photographers aboard nasa viking spacecraft the picture taken you can clearly see face the landform but the picture taken the atmosphere was extremely cloudy there was any indentation mars base you couldn see because the clouds because this scientists went out another attempt capture good image the fae mars and they succeeded the picture that was taken clearly showed that the face was longer there which lead scientists believe that was combination natural landform and the shadows casted from the sun rays that made that particular spot look like,2

the first image the face mars was captured nasa viking was circling the planet when spotted the likeness human face nearly two miles from end end the face was from region called cydonia scientists figured was just another mesa landforms common this area when nasa released the picture the public became pop icon some people think the face evidence life mars however nasa disagrees conspiracy theorists feel that the face true reason for existence something that nasa would rather hide the mean time nasa budget defenders wish there was ancient civilization mars finding such thing would greatly benefit nasa and hel them many ways therefore the face really was proof life mars nasa wouldn hiding they would announcing for their own good april michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped another picture ten times sharper than the original photos the new image first appeared the jpl web site revealing that the face was fact natural landform not ancient alien civilization however conspiracy theorists were still not satisfied due the fact that was cloudy time the year mars nasa prepared look again and captured final picture april what the pictured shows mesa landforms common around the american west the three images nasa snapped the face none them show any alien monuments civilizations the increased pixel sizes would have picked any objects the ground such pyramids planes there reason for nasa believe they discovered anything other than common natural landform the only difference that this landform has unusual shadows that make look like egyptian pharaoh,3
you believe aliens abundance people america think there are others among from other planets and galaxies they believe this for variety reasons such ufo sightings because the called face cydonia the red planet mars throughout the years since have worked nasa discover the secrets the face uncovering that indeed just landform with suspicious shadows the face just ordinary landform mars with unusual shadowing because recent pictures taken the natural landform scientific evidence and measurements taken start nasa has taken recent picture cydonia that shows just natural landform that has developed the red planet mars april cloudless summer day cydonia mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look had roll the spacecraft degrees center the face the field view said garvin malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel inv the best viking photo this shows that nasa has gotten clear photo the face with much better photo quality then the first time iit was photographed discussed before nasa has taken new and better quality photo the face cydonia using our scientific equipment nasa have proven just how much better the resolution the new photograph taken rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger that the pixel size added there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were this quote from the article shows has been scientifically proven there markings indentations objects around the face that would make human skull finally nasa compares the face landform with similar landforms earth america the scientist compares the face with landform called buttle mesa landforms common around the american west reminds middle buttle the snake river plain idaho says garvin that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars this uses real life example and measurements compare the two landforms the scientist garvin points out that both landforms the middle buttle the snake river plain idaho and the face mars are around the height and shape the contrary some people believe that the face bona fide evidence life mars evidence that nasa would rather hide say conspiracy theorists defense nasa has scientifically proven the face just natural landform created mars what the picture really shows the martien equivalent buttle mesa landforms common around the american west conclusion some people may think there alien life mars because past picture conspiracy theories one can deny however that nasa has proven the face nothing but natural landform the red planet mars nasa has proven this recent pictures scientific evidence and real life examples and measurements over the years nasa has worked hard figure out the mystery the face and just recently they have discovered with pictures evidence and measurements that the face just natural landform with unusual shadowing formed the red planet mars,5
the challenge exploring venus about nasa wanting figure out way get venus without getting hurt damaged least being able send space craft but none the space crafts have survived the have keep thinking ways get venus not because something wrong but because the are fascinated the called earths twin evening star venus however not planet where you can just the temperatures are hot they melt most the space crafts and the pressure high that submarine would crushed nasa wants try allow scientist float above the fray hovering miles above the roiling venusian land try and get close the planet without getting hurt the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers telling and all the people reading this text that long ago their might have been time where venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth today venus still has some those features that are analogous those earth just like earth venus also has valleys and mountains the author also thinks its good idea keep studying venus because the value returning venus seems indisputable but what are the options for making such mission both safe and scientifically productive the author thinks important get venus but also want safe about paragraph the author states striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likley lead into many equally intimidating endeavors our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation this paragraph the author telling that exploring things important life order what else out there exploring different things can also useful depending whats found out there the article the challenge exploring venus think the author supports the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers giving many examples why might good idea work through the dangers and work our way towards finding safe way get venus,4
dear senator many people say that electoral college non democratic method selecting president that ought overruled declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner even though agree with this position arguing that the electoral college method not democratic modern sense the electors who elect the president not the people when you vote for presidential candidate you actually voting for slate electors despite the electoral college despite its lack democratic pedigree belive that retaining the electoral college what best for non liberal conservative reasons the electoral college avoids the problem electrons which candidate receives majority the votes cast for instance one sources told and clinton both had only percent plurality the popular votes while winning majority the electoral college the electoral college restores some the weight the political balance that large states population lose virtue the mal apportionment the senate decreed the constitution for example another source the popular vote was very close florida nevertheless obama who won that vote got electoral votes victory the same margin wyoming would net the winner only electoral votes large states gets more attention from presidential candidates campaign than small state does hope that you agree with when say that should retain the electoral college,2
the facial action coding system can read peoples expressions should this technology used classrooms detect the emotions the students this technology should not used detect the emotions students the article stated that this tech could used detect when student getting tired bored the lesson this would then allow the computer liven the lesson the text states directly then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this line makes seem like the facs technology would replace teachers the classroom teaches not need technology tell their students are bored the text says people just know what the emotions others are the teacher would know when and how modify the lesson keep their students interested and engaged would know what the technology would modify the lesson would the students just able angry the lessons until the computer just stops giving the student lessons using this tech not alternative having real person tell how you feel the teacher can help you feel better because they know how you really feel because they have empathy the computer can tell how you feel but does not what like feel the end can really help should the facs tech used the classroom because the students need teacher help them feel better when they are frustrated sad not computer that can only try and make them happy also seem stat they want this tech replace our teachers which would hurt the students more than would help them,3
dear state senator all know that the presidental election process very important our nation many believe that using electoral college not democratic pedigree and that using the popular vote method better believe that you keep the electoral college electing our nation president there less likely chance that there will dispute and avoid run off elections with electoral college during presidental election possible have dispute over who should our next president the electoral college helps reduce that issue addition the electoral college voting method better than voting popular vote with electoral college less likely have dispute lot think that dispute over electoral college could not happen according defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president dispute possible dispute happened but less likely than dispute over popular vote the reason that the winning candidate share the electoral college rarely exceeds his share the popular vote the third source gave example the obama and romney election obama recieved percent and romney recieved percent the electoral vote making certain outcome the election and not resulting dispute also with electoral college avoid run off election continue the electoral college avoids ruin off election avoids the problem where candidate recieve majority the votes cast the third source stated above gave example using the nixon and clinton election they both had only percent plurality the popular votes while winning majority the electoral college when candidate wins majority the votes cast complicates the presidental election the electoral college reduces any complication involving that although the electoral college the method which select our president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has hope carrying their state democrats texas republicans california have less incentive pay attention the campaign knowing their vote would have effect but voter vote swings national election which means about one half the americans eligible vote did not people that vote are people who want express their political preference rather than people who think that single vote may decide election the electoral college method the choice pick believe that the electoral college the method should continue using when electing our nation president less likely have dispute and would avoid run off election with the electoral college this method has been working and should continue work for our nation sincerely proper name,4
when nasa discovered this face first they didn know what say they just passed another martian mesa scientist figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh eighteen years later after the viking space trip they decided take more photos the technology improved was giving them clearer image they got the pictures and soon put them out for the public see the authors reasoned would good way engage the public and attract attention mars thousands people that were waiting for this image soon saw was just landform jpl website revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all then later they figured out that the picture was actually butte mesa what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west garvin says reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho thats lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars,1
personally think that driverless cars are not good idea they seem very dangerous and although might seem cool you will still have give your full attention the road not more like stated paragraph none these cars are completely driverless you will have watch out for construction and traffic accidents and take control another good reason too why should not begin using driverless cars would people might fall asleep driving night for long period time can make you very tired and you might doze off what you are postion where you need paying attention the road and you are asleep that your life the line and anyone else that might out the roads with that being said think could good training technique for people that are handicapped blind giving them sense independence think would useful but very much against driverless cars seems like accident waiting happen,2
claim about the author idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despite more important because the closest planet next earth and gets more attention then the other planets because closer humans jus feel like that the more important planet value but explanation about claim this article the article says venus referred earth twin and the closet earth the also call venus the evening star its the brightest light the night sky and another fact can say between the sun and the earth and think thats why make special even though mercury closer too the sun and the text says venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet the solar system and venus haves features that are analogous those earth opinon venus has almost alot things with deal with earth,1
having technology read students emotions awesome technology and should used todays society all starts when prof thomas huang started working with prof nicu sebe develop better ways for humans and computers communicate the computer constructs computer model the face uses your face muscles identify what you are feeling that moment pupal eckman created this new software called facs facial action coding system classified six basic emotions happiness surprise anger disgust fear sadness having this kind technology teachers parents bosses coaches etc can see what their child student feeling also what their learning some people dont like talking about their feelings their grades when people you trust know whats going with you without you telling them way easier with the knowing now they can get you the help you need because obviously you scared get help your own all children around the world are going through something their lives fear sadness anger boredom confusion when children become sad for long periods time they become depressed which leads substance abuse isolating themselves from others eating disorders and injuring themselves suicide cutting when children become angry this effects their learning and they start become confused what their learning school some them drop put but dropping out isnt always your best option fact dropping out isnt good option all classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this helps children get learning point school where they can understand basic tools life child does not know what they doing and they dont want feel embarrassed telling the teacher then the computer can identify that and help them and know one else will know they have reason embarassed using computer generate your emotions unbelievable and should used today using this technology could prevent students from doing things they might regret the future and helping them succeed life through not only schooling but living their own when their older and getting job knowing what within their occupations,4

yes facial action coding system great way see how students feel because not everyone shows there emotions facs going help many students when they show how they feel for example classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor will help develop better ways for people and computers communicate how facs works starts with model persons face will have muscles the model and they have move like human muscles facs technology will show persons emotions like happy mad surprised angry sad and scared will know when you move muscle and can detect what emotion the person doing for example your frontalis lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you surprised your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips show anger this technology safe and will very useful for many people conclusion facs will develop more and will help many students school home and just general this technology will very useful and very productive facial action coding system will develop better ways for people and computers communicate,2
what most people think can things better people machines like most people believe things are done better hand would someone want lifesaving operation done living doctor that knows what going and where things are robot that programmed and could malfunction believe that driverless cars pose threat against people and cars should remain human control all times cars not actually see the things that surround them the driver decides not pay attention and one the cars sensors were malfunction then the lives many people hang balance road constructions and traffic jams could pose threat well when these things happen the cars just shut down try and get through themselves either way major safety hazards will arise just like paragraph right now driverless cars can not even get out driveway alone unless some major adjustments were come soon driverless cars remain huge threat safety what someone were get hurt driverless car accident the car malfunctions and the driver could not take control and gets hurt who willingly takes responsibility the driver the company like stated paragraph figure this out the country would have make more laws all that will waste large amount time for both the companies that make driverless cars and congress who makes the laws driverless cars will give people trouble before they even hit the road believe that driverless cars pose threat against people and cars should remain human control all times matter what driverless cars not have the instances and emotions humans cars can not see what lies feet front them only humans can see that technology fails too much and letting cars drive for poses great threat this time,3
fellow citizens cars are dying out every year more and more people are realizing the cultural and natural impact that cars are having negative way there are many advantages that come with eliminating cars from society for one reason that can start eliminate roads and highways and use that land for houses something else another reason that will help the world out natural way stop temperatures from sky rocketing completely melting the polar cap and prevent smog from building dense cities citzens also wont have spend money fuel car anymore and can save money soon citizens completely wipe out the use cars then alot positives will result out soon cars are out the picture then societies can use the space from highways and roads make houses and shopping centers that are walking distance from those houses living communities when people need drive long distances get another destination thats far away from where they live then they can take theyre car thats the outskirt the city protected garage just like they vauban germany they this order keep the city within completely safe and pollutant free from cars now and ever since the invention automobiles like buses and cars the world has changed dramatically temperature earth has become like microwave just trapping heat from the greenhouse effect which causes the carbon dioxide from the cars stay earth andan not expell space which has caused some the highest temperatures the last years with the elimination cars less carbon dioxide will let out causing the earth cool and thus will help save the polar ice caps not only will save the cold areas the world but will also help reduce smog denley packed cities like paris and besieging now cities like paris and bogota have had certain days where they prohibit the use cars the city help and calm the smog down this method has helped dramatically and was only for one day imagine what doing this forever can for the enviroment another topic for eliminating the use cars the economic change will positively have the enviroment for one families wont have spend money gas second they wont have spend money for car last but not least third they wont have spend money tolls tickets simply you dont have car you wont have worry about any those problems families can use all that saved money for going vacations themselves,4
student high school think the new facial action coding system should used reason for saying that teachers could use for their lesson and see the kids are getting bored the lesson liking the teacher could use the new technology help change the lesson keep depending the students facial expressions using the new technology for example paragraph huang tells even though individuals often show varying degrees expression like not smiling using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements the mona lisa just painting and the new software technology can even tell thats shes happy disgusted fearful and angry that opinion amazing who would guested that could tell how she was ealing through painting couple hundred years later the computer constructs model the face and uses the major muscles the model must move like human muscles their are six basic emotions happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness and the movement your muscles they can tell what emotion you are feeling they tell paragraph that our home can handle the complex algorithm used diode the mona lisa while looking the mirror raising your lips the corner your mouth then squinting your eye slighty produce wrinkling the corner your eye holding that raise the outer parts your cheeks towards your eyes will describe your emotion being happy introduction that the new technology great idea for for teacher anyone use students can change the way teachers teach and also change the world,2
venus one the brightest stars the solar system and considered the second sun almost dense earth and said called earths twin the planet has been studied very closely even though are miles and miles away the planet almost impossible land every spaceship that has landed has crashed disappeared the atmosphere dense taking regular iphone there would melt entering each layer the atmosphere the most challenging point venus atmospheric pressure which ninety times greater then earth and has the ground temperature eight hundred degrees farenheit scientists have seelen many volcanos and lightning outbursts very close intervals time venus which can make landing and space travel difficult nasa says orbiting thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth which means the ground would liquify metal since venus one the closest planets could possibly travel too nasa has been experimenting and planning nasa has been planning bring back the mechanical computer from world war two bring into space because its dense steel and metals some may contemplate venus just rock planet and empty scientist have discovered that venus has has earth features like rocks craters valleys and mountains even though venus far away and very dangerous our society curious and will grow until the journey venus and back accomplished,2
there are many advantages limiting car usage there are important sources that tell why people should limit car usage source german suburb life goes without cars source paris bans driving due smog source car free day spinning into big hit bogota last but not least source the end car culture begin with sources you can tie the two sources conclude that limiting car usage going germany and paris most people walk ride bikes catch the train car ownership allowed but there are only places put them large garages the edge the development where car owner buys space for along with home german suburb life goes without cars para paris decided ban driving clear the air global cities source paris bans driving due smog para diesel was blamed since france has tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline well sources car free day spinning into big hit bogota and cars have come end with culture they feel though when people ride bikes and trains can prevent car jams source car free day spinning into big hit bogota para the goal was promote alternative transportation and reduce smog source car free day spinning into big hit bogota para shows that for example van services can share services have less cars and less gasoline they also have bike sharing company that you can share bikes and dont even need use vehicle conclusion there are advantages limiting the use cars with helpful sources source german suburb life goes without cars source paris bans driving due smog source car free day spinning into big hit bogota last but not least source the end car culture prove the advantages limiting cars,1

have you ever seen those movies will the smart cars that drive themselves like the bat mobile batman those aren just cool but also really safe and may the type transportation the future years like the idea one and buy one the development driverless cars brilliant because will change the world will cause less accidents and the new trend sergey brin google cofounder belives that driverless cars will change the world how they would use half the fuel todays cars and more flexible technology improving everyday and this good because all these new things are being put the market and making cars safer sebastián thrun founder the google car project stated there was way before make something interesting the sensors weren there the computers weren there and the mapping wasn there this shows that technology improving that driverless cars will evolve the world driverless cars cause accidents google has had cars drive independently since and have been driven half million miles without accident isn that incredible lot car crashes are caused drunk driving and texting but that the driver won driving wouldnt that mean accidents are going happen much now automakers have been working with sensors and within years they have become more advanced responding danger these sensors would stop the car were about crash into something the sensors have better response and control than human driver driverless cars will the new trend because everyone going wanting one and will safer how many times havey seen your favorite actress wear something and you were like want that almost everyone has said that least said that know have but the point that all the celebrities will have one them and that would make want have too mean look the advantages driverless car believe that driverless cars are brilliant because they are the new trend will change the wolrd and cause accidents you haven seen movie with one these driverless cars then you better search one and watch because they really are fascinating,4
dear senator the electoral college has been around for many years now and chosen who would become president our country believe that you should stop listening the electoral college who will the new president and start listening the citizens the united states are the ones who know what want and who feel will great leader for our country when citizens vote its known the popular vote even though vote every four years its honestly waste time because the electoral college doesnt care what think what matters them that they make the final decision which president they think care about more its not fair deserve say who want lead the right direction back the segregationists louisiana legislature just about succeeded changing the democratic electors with ones who would oppose john kennedy they succeeded john kennedy would have never became president even though the popular vote wanted him conclusion think its best take away the electoral college while are voting for president the people have the right choose who they feel will the most honest and most loyal president run our country thank you for taking the time read this and hear what believe should done sincerely proper name,2
dear senator hereby inform you that favor changing the election popular vote for the president the united staes the kind have now for many reasons believe the electoral college should abolish due the process electing the next president during the electoral college voters tend vote but not vote for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president believe that over percent voters would prefer election the kind have now said before you know the electoral college consist electors making majority electoral votes elect the president california making the state with the most electoral votes state that could rise candidates votes and considered the following candidates that california could enormous help for the candidate many voters have many questions regardless the electoral vote for example can voters control whom their electors vote for nor who picks the electors the place these are few questions that many voters have believe should formenty and focus more the popular vote those who are qualified citizens the biggest disaster with the electoral college was when the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century therefore making state legislatures responsible for picking electors during electoral college vote the electoral vote ends tie the election would held the house representatives whereas state delegations would vote the president candidates don get spend time the states they know having chance not winning result that the campaign approximately seventeen states didn have the opportunity see the candidates the other hand the electoral college avoids the problem elections therefore considerate the electoral college vote unfair voters,2
although you have made good points concerning the landform mars would like respectfully disagree your opinion that aliens are responsible for the building cydonia the passage unmasking the face mars the author has quotes comparing the face cydonia natural landforms earth such mountains and messias through the passage and its comparisons can infer that the face mars face just made natural causes and the impact the weather you really think and dig deeper the picture the face could resemble mountains small hills posted positioned relatively close together that the image face possible lastly the reason why cydonia fact just landform the way that the author writes the passage nasa very briefly mentions the possible outcome aliens but other than that nothing else has been said about the could creatures they must not firm believers which leads the conclusion that nasa had discovered aliens wouldn that make them most popular the discovery new life would without doubt absolutely fantastic for nasa and its image the thought that there might life mars good enough situation lie and say that you did find life only have your buisness the tabloids can all infer that nasa had discovered that cydonia had been built aliens american citizens would the first know you cant hide something like this that would make your buisness sucessful conclusion can infer that cydonia fact landform some sort the face mars know this through the discussion that landforms are built with natural causes not aliens and that the face were built aliens wouldn hidden from citizens knowing that the discovery could boom multiple businesses,3

keeping the electoral college could bad idea popular vote more citizen agreed vote there have been many people who have won the popular vote such richard nixon jimmy carter and bob dole and have still lost the presidency and its all because the electoral college the electoral college stays then what the point having the citizens vote means nothing the winner the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote the electoral college requires presidential candidate transregional appeal there pressure for run off elections when candidate wins majority the votes cast democrats texas and republicans california know their vote will have effect they have less incentive pay attention the campaign than they would have the president were picked popular vote those are reasons for changing the electoral college,2
belive that the facs facial action coding system would good use school because like says the article teacher would know when student bored and they could change the lesson little bit make more intersecting seems like would good tool use school the facs could help students who dont normally ask the teacher for help get help the system could recognize student was lost confused the thing they working the teacher could then that student and help them with that problem they are and might lead them asking questions the future because they might feel comfortable asking that teacher for help could also help guidance consoles find the depressed mad kids and help them with their problems the machine knows your mixed emotions which great because student might look like they get the problem they working but really they need help and the teacher can recognize that and get the student the help they need pretty cool that computer can constrict model your face and get all facial muscles move along with conclusion the facs would very helpful schools but probably very expensive but sure someone were make claim school board committe the committe would find funding for enough people were board with this machine would help school knowing how the students feel while they school and knowing what students understand and don understand can help the teachers change the lessons for their future students they teach,3
driverless cars have more negative aspects then positive against the developement these types cars understand that need better our ways public transportation but many dangers come with driverless cars and think that the risks are just not worth one negative effect with driverless cars far they not have the ability detect when road conditions change from the noram like road work traffic jams accidents that recently occured the next major danger these cars people lives could the effect error with the manufacturers another aspect most people who have been driving their own for while may not feel comfortable with giving control technology having driverless cars would take lot trust this technology and that may hard thing accomplish driverless cars may not have positive effect today world putting people situations that are extremely risky not worth being able sit back and relax while technology controlling you the world modernizing and technology practically everything but have focused and control because putting too much trust into technology that could possibly have faults can become safety hazard,2
against driverless cars because you dont want have the responsibility drive car you shouldn have one also against because the car could something you dont want the main point you shouldn have car you dont want control that case you might well ride bus airplane also would cost alot money you would have buy certain types streets and that would mess other cars you would have upgrade the roads frequently but most importantly wouldnt want smart cars because they maybe would cause alot accidents they could run red lights stop signs driverless cars are also not good because you could your cellphone and accidently take control and you dont know also bad because that means the people cars won wear seatbelts and they get car crash the are going get hurt,1
the passage driverless cars are coming they talk about the existence cars that drive their own they also include their functions and how they work the debate that this situation causes whether not should these driverless cars should continue developed driverless cars should not continue developed because they can expensive make and repair and new laws will need created for safety matters driverless cars can come with high cost not only will big price pay make these cars imagine the cost getting repaired gets broken google modified uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps recieve these cars include lot technology and different sensors the repair sensor can cost someone lot money also not only will people needing smart car but the country will also need prepared with smart roads the smart roads will help the electric cars sending radio signals these smart road systems worked but they required massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply too expensive practical the roads can another cost this time not only for the people but for the country upgrading the roads just for these cars will just too much the driverless cars will nothing but bring meroe into debt electric cars can safety issue the community and the drivers themselves different states already have all their driving rules set out keep everyone safe with these new driverless cars new laws will needed the technology fails and someone injured who fault that will another responsibility that the hands someone will need laws for who held responsible for what actions need taken when something goes wrong and others keep pedestrians from getting hurt well although the electric cars alert drivers when take control you never know when could fail inform you and could too late some states don even allow the testing self driven cars conclusion driverless cars should discontinued their developement and repair can costey people they aren proven safe either the drivers pedestrians nearby you never know when sensor can damaged and you will have take action right away also there will need new laws created continue protect the drivers and others who could get hurt should stick our original vehicles,4
imagine this you are cross country road tip with your family you are the passenger seat while you significant other driving with your two children the back what you you sing you talk and you laugh but the biggest thing you make memories now imagine you are doing all this while your car driving itself what happens when something goes wrong and accident occurs and you can longer make these memories with your family anymore driverless car pose many threats todays society they suggest laziness and take the fun out driving they can without any certain stop all car accidents that happen day day basis they also can unrealistic for these reasons why driverless cars are not necesssary item have the future start off driverless car would impose laziness for the person who operates how would you tell who can operate one and who can how would you have driver test the car drives itself that also takes the fun out learning how drive also yes would easier and less work but then you would not have the memories that come with learning how drive and the feeling learning and experiencing something new that you will use for the rest your life memories that you won have your car does all the work the next reason why driverless cars are not practical invision because they are not completely driverless the article the writer states the human driver must remain alert and ready take over that means that sleeping while driving would not safe nor would interacting while the road all you would doing driving with hands actually the article also bring point about accident were accursed who would blame would you the manufacturer someone injured who you put the blame the person with there hands there sides huge manufacturing company like the practicality car thar drives itself another reason why driverless cars are negative not positive want for the future last reason for why driverless car negative rather than positive the fact that they are unrealistic and unpractical the average day person can afford bmw car made google how these companies think that car that drives itself would not the same the article also makes point say mercedes bens audi and nissan plan have cars that can drive themselves two things stick out that sentence one being that all three those car brands are labled luxury cars and second being that this dream car would not accessible until the year for this reason why believe driverless car dream only meant come true jenson episode rather than everyday life conclude driverless car would easier way that you would have little more lee way move your car more like get that fry you dropped inbetween the console and your seat for example but would also take the memory dropping that fry your car they would make you feel lazy could also cause more trouble you were ever get into accident and they are not practical for average day joe for these reasons believe that driverless car would strong negative rather than positive,4
emotions are what you feel daily basis sometimes you can happy and something you can sad this passage making mona lisa smile students from the university illinois collaborated with prof nicu sebe from the university amsterdam they developed better ways for humans and computers communicate the technology read emotional expressions students classroom valuable because can how how the student feeling and can help see the student enjoying what learning one facial expression can give all away how you are feeling facial action coding system can identify mixed emotions each expression that being made compared neutral face that not showing any emotional student having bad day something wrong with them the software will instantly let them know how they are feeling the painting mona lisa they were not sure what her emotions she percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry another reason valuable can help see student enjoying what doing for example the passage says classroom computer coul recognize when student becoming confused bored that were happen would able modify the lesson such effective human instructor the use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable examples why valuable are while student working lesson the computer can find out how student feeling and seeing student enjoying what she learning,3
dear senator the electoral voting system should abolished unfair and democratic electoral votes are not the votes the people and thats all that should matter but there are counterclaims that will address when apperson votes they not actually vote for their candidate they vote for group electors for that candidate electors who may not even vote for the candidate they are sworn the electoral voting system extremly unstable there are even number electoral voters the united states making tied vote possibility which very bad even though electoral votes are supposedly based which candidates people vote for does not all mean that the candidate who most the people voted for wil also voted for the electoral college the electoral voters are seperated state and each state has its own number electoral voters proportional their population because this candidates change their campaigns only focus statesthe more electoral voters while this makes sense from competitive perspective makes extremly unfair states with smaller populations this wrong many ways but the worst all that the electoral voting system encourages this kind competition the electoral voting system democratic the united states prides itself being for the people and freedom but the electoral college represents the exact opposite that the electoral college votes not the people the people are not voting and that the exact opposite what the united states supposedly stands for anyone who learns about the united states and sees the electoral college will think that the united states not all its cracked and that not what the united states wants conclusion the senator you should defiantly try work toward abolishing the electoral college democratic because does not allow the people have direct say who they are voting for very volatile voting system that could cause crashes and severities the united states saving tied votes and such the electoral voting system encourages some states left out unfair competition because the unstable way the number electoral voters are balanced between states and the electoral college essentially goes against everything the united states stands for and supposed believe,4

the author claims that venus worthy pursuit because holds lot value even though its cold and makes hard study still like earth and can hold life and anything could and the fast that can hold human life gets people curiousity going the reason why say this because the many details and such includes the artifical such rock gas whatever that that planet can get and knowing that venus holds some features analogous earth makes very interesting and wondering that life could exist some details from the artifical that helps know that life could exist venus that has some features analogous those earth also knowing that could has oceans has right now surface rocky sediment valleys mountains and craters and even though the possible dangers trying get much research has been done the planet and our technology has advanced and could possibily find way the future reach this point see what venus really holds and what can hold,2
the author supports this claim since talks about how its very hard travel venus the thick atmosphere carbon dioxide the average temperature degrees fahrenheit the pressure times greater than earths pressure their are many earth quakes and volcanoes venus many astronomers are fascinated venus since they think long time ago was covered ocean and had life forms living their nasa has idea send humans venus study the planet and its condition they would send blimp like vehicle hovering over venusian landscape would hovering over venus for about miles the people that they send venus would not have any samples from the planet since they would not touch the surface venus nasa knows this big risk but they are still willing take they have simulated kind material that would used venus and lasted for about weeks the computers now are fast powerful and flexible but they can stand the condition venus has even though its dangerous should always take risks should explore more places but still dont have thaat kind technology venus could habitable planet the idea sending blimp like vehicle venus smart but dangerous the blimp would only last week was sent venus the blimp has floating about miles away from the surface the computers indie the blimp would have stong and fast survive the planet does not have easy conditions but survivable for humans venus one the hottest planets our solar system venus hotter than mercury even though mercury closer the sun the reason venus hotter than mercury because its gases venus contains its planet venus hot enough liquefy any metal even though venus not habitable its soil could still live above its soil would have get used the lightning and massive earth quakes this planet has its nearly imposible live the soil venus,4
the face mars just natural landform and not created aliens one reason this true because natural landforms occur all the time even earth another reason this statement true because when nasa was taking the photographs they did not see any alien life form anywhere the face mars just natural landform because natural landforms occur earth too one reason this true because paragraph garvin states reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho therefore proves that landforms natural occurence planets another reason the face mars just natural landform because when nasa was taking photographs they didn find alien life form this statement can true because paragraph says that rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see this can prove that there was not any alien life form mars therefore the face mars natural landform the face mars natural landform one reason this could true because natural landforms occur earth too second reason this could true because when nasa was taking photographs they did not find any alien lifeform with this evidence their prove that the face one mars just natural landform,3
studying planet called venus worthy pursuit but dangerous have seen the paragraph exploring venus can teach alot things and there alot things that can learn venus like there life there can grow something there but man have put his foot because too dangerous and too hard over there seen the first paragraph venus sometimes called the evening star because one the brightest points light the night sky venus also known earth twin since the closest planet earth terms density and size venus sometimes right around the corner and humans have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world each pervious mission man which mean just airplane robot because spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours that the reason the man have ever step for others reason too hot even though mercury closer our sun the average the planet surface degrees which can kill and has greater presser than earth times greater than earth the others reason that has powerful earthquakes erupting and frequent lightning stikes probes seeking land its surface get over there nasa trying make thing that can land the planet and stay for very long time that they can explore alot our people are trying venus but challenging they are trying and become stronger our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation,2
exploring venus seems very interesting when thinking about all the beneficial things that can study and analyze studying other planets have always been helpful mankind and helps people gain insight our solar system around but the same time exploring these planets are very dangerous too not because animals humans but because the harsh living conditions other planets will tell you why think exploring venus not worth the pursuit exploring first reason why think venus not worth the pursuit because the difficulty exploring venus paragraph states that ships orbiting over venus with lights can see the ground because the dense atmosphere which makes hard for scientists because you can see anything you can analyze any data that you get because venus features but does state that nasa trying find new ways exploring venus but not good hands exploration which good but most likely not good enough find out what they want about the planet second reason why think venus not worth the exploration because venus conditions and features when reading about venus the conditions are very extreme compared the conditions earth such clouds filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid temperatures that average over degrees making the planet with the hottest surface temperature even though mercury closer the sun also the atmospheric pressure great enough crush accustomed submarine that would able dive into the deepest parts the ocean and liquefies metals but having similarities earth such erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and etc conclusion feel that venus should not planet heavily invest and scientists should try other planets before venus because the harsh conditions that would have humans because the difficulty canalization making venus non reliable source compared others that why think that venus not worth exploring,4
the reason you should join seagoing cowboy program because they get travel around the seven sea boat luke thinks fun because having the time his lifetime and likes because work gas station and grocery store luke want place thats far way then can pick his boat plane plane luke would have pay the passport but goes his boat would just have pay for the gas plane will shorter however boat will longer get plane luke like the water going boat will good for him also like the sound the waves make when they and the rocking noise the boat make the water can make knew friends the way there,2
think that this technology would valuable the facial action coding system was created paul eckman computer software that can detect simply emotions depending your facial expression the software uses video imagery and then weighs different units identify emotions believe something that would valuable believe would valuable because according huang depending how student feeling during lesson the software could modify the lesson almost like actual teacher most humans tend not stay engaged something they aren having fun the software would able make the lesson more engaging and would want students learn more the facial action coding system tool can also detect painting emotions well but mainly could help communicate teacher when students aren engaged think that would very valuable tool used correctly,2
the author supports his main idea very clear why studying venus worth despite the dangers presents the author develops his claim through facts from nasa and facts about venus the writer the story supports saying will gain human curiosity venus once has been like earth and how electronic devices can melt due venus weather first the author supports the idea exploring venus because venus once been like earth paragraph states astronomers are fascinates venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system another example from paragraph long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and coul have supported various forms life just like earth this illustrates how the author supports the idea studying venus because can show how venus was once like earth and astronomers see what happen those features can show them how earth was like long time ago addition the author supports his idea telling the readers that can gain human curiosity paragraph the author states striving meet the challenge presentar venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors another example from paragraph doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation these examples illustrate how the author supports his idea saying that exploration venus can cause human wonder how venus was like and see the challenges venus has despite the dangers that comes with lastly the author talks about how venus weather like tells the readers that very harsh weather paragraph the author states nasa working other approaches studying venus for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions another example from paragraph just imagine exposing cell phone tablet acid heat capable melting tin this simplifies the authors support stating that astronomers should see what causes that weather and how they can study venus safely matter conclusion the author supports his idea various ways the authors tells the reader how venus its own character the authors tells the dangers venus the writer showed his support human curiosity how venus climate was and how was once made like earth,4

the evening star while being planet still shines bright our solar system and has the heat back while being the closest related earth out the rest our solar system even refered earth twin paragraph still nearly unlivable most not all forms life its current state some scientists however believe that venus was very life sustaining long time ago believed that even had oceans all this and people still believe that should make this endeavor and try our hands getting there and getting back alive and possible while being extremly difficult the author the passage the challenge exploring venus also believes that should our best get there despite all the challenges while venus very hot place the author lists ways overcome this obstacle paragraph the author talks about how the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans study venus their idea was blimp like vehicle that would float above the fray many venus obstacles such the hell like heat the blimp would put the vehicle miles above the surface making the temperature only degrees fahrenheit instead boiling degrees fahrenheit this vehicle would also help stay above the hazardous ground conditions making this reliable vehicle and good point make the authors passage the author points out paragraph how similar venus earth and how sometimes the closet planet earth out the universe this point helpful because points out how venus used very inhabitable and how still could today with some help from modern technology for life for the author this was very helpful point include for the arguement the author also included how the landmarks venus point towards used having oceans and this amazing because far has been extremly not impossibly rare have found water other places the universe paragraph the author states that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life this very compelling point because proves that venus was hospitable some point its life time poking the curiousity the human race having said all this believe that the author made very compelling point towards exploring venus even though there are many dangerous obstacles the human races way the author believes that truly possible explore this beautiful planet paragraph the author states our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation this part the passage believe came from the author heart and the arguement made throughout was truly tremendous one,4
the author gives lot reasons that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the first good reason geaves venus have been the most earth like planet our solar system also explain why venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth saying just like earth this very important sice knowing venus has some characteristics commun with our planet makes easier think and prove this planet could possibily fos the future the author keeps supporting his idea studying venus with some more examples that both them have like valleys mountains and craters and this good reason because since the more things commun they have the more probabilities there are for with venus also recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit which means really need study this planet want get this goal conclusion the author supports the idea with many good reasons and all them are very important for because this planet could maybe possibility for the future least gives some clues sice has lot things commun with the earth,3
driverless cars are good thing for the future they can kind help drive when someone tired and can prevent accidents they help take people lives out danger think the development these cars good thing for the world start off the fuel needed for these cars half the fuel amount use right now regular cars stated the first paragraph that saying that the amount you are paying now for gas would cut half there are sensors these smart cars that have been placed everywhere around the cars places such the mirror the wheels and the roof these sensors may not new but they have developed into something amazing that helps protect the driverless cars have many functions that can help protect people many different ways and situations some those functions include antilock brakes and driver assisting they have come long way developing this driverless car theses cars can now steer themselves accelerate and brake themsleves this huge step car technology there are some things that the cars may need done make perfect but still one step closer making our lives little easier these cars will have car entertainment and information systems that use heads displays these displays will turned off when instantly when the driver needs take over the car system saftey feature the car the driverless cars are the next step going into the future they have many great features such steering themselves sensors that detect things and handling driving functions the driverless cars can change the future for the good and can also help make the roads little more safer,3
schools should use facial action coding systems try imagine world where people might able hide their feelings from others but not the computer there has been new software developed that has the ability determine people emotions called facial action coding system the software has even been able determine exactly how much percent each emotion present the mona lisa this software arises there has been questions how schools could use this software their advantage with this system schools could help students stay tune class place students with teachers they learn well from and force students tell the truth the facial action coding sytem should used schools because teachers would have the opportunity change the way they are teaching when their students start get bored many cases students not well school simply because their teacher might too boring confusing teachers had the ability know when students are getting bored through this system then there good chance the students would get better grades result with this software classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored there would excuses for teachers boring confusing students because they would have tool become aware another key part students being successful school having teacher that they truly connect with therefore the software system could play large part helping schools place students with teachers that they have connection with with the software system genuine smile and forced one could detected using the data found students could placed with the teachers that they have genuine smiles with there good chance that students were with teacher they truly like then they would learn more from the lessons and get better grades schools there are constantly many lies and rumors going around but with the software system lying could detected considering the system can spot when smiling politician celebrity isn being truthful could able determine when students are lying lying schools could detected there could decrease bullying and possibly shootings could even teach students that honesty the best policy and could hold students accountable for their actions the system could uncover the truth many situations for the better the end the new software system has many positive aspects that could benefit schools many ways including helping students learn more efficiently and forcing students tell the truth not using this tool that has come available would foolish knowing the many benefits that could come from something that could help students learn their school work more efficient way and hold students responsible for their actions would good thing for schools this day and age could have the capability teach students integrity young age putting them ahead many young adults the world today,4
believe that the called face mars actually just rock formation that appears face because low tech cameras from two decades ago going explain why believe that claim correct first clearly obvious that the face only nappers face because low resolution cameras and odd shadows you can see from the most recent photographs the rock face even the picture pretty clear that not fact face but just rock formation the clouds obscure some the face the picture might not conclusive but the picture proves also there were alien life mars that would skyrocket nasa budget get mars because the public would going crazy and the whole world would want know there were alien life mars and nasa was the administration discover the whole world eyes and wallets would them expecting them put some men mars try make contact with the martian life forms thus winning the race put astronauts mars conclusion believe that the face mars just rock formation and nothing more than that there are clear reasons why nasa would want this alien life more than anyone and reasons why they would not keep secret from the public,3
the author claims that investigating venus surface worth our time even tho there are many dangers there because venus one point time may have had similiar feature that earth does such water venus has similar geological traits and venus sometimes the closest planet earth making venus likely trip scientist believe that one point time venus had oceans its surface along with other life forms such vegetation and maybe alien life long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth would ground breaking discovery man kind were able discover new form life another planet under venus thick atmosphere and its giant corrosive clouds the geological formation venus similar our planet venus has craters and mountains like earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters with such similar features our home planet makes venus likely option send mankind visit during earth orbit there are points time were mars the closet planet and other times when venus the closest planet since venus closer the sun orbits faster than earth while mars farther from the sun has slower orbit since venus points time the closest planet makes likely option visit furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel with venus being the closest planet given time makes ideal planet study believe the author proves valid point why need travel venus because venus could have had really similar features earth one point time venus also has similar geological traits and venus sometimes the closest planet earth with that information given the author makes the idea studying venus worthy pursuit despite the many dangers there are,4
why would you want limit car usage when you use your car people are making money people need car far away places fast cars are expensive thats because people keep adding and making more fancy and corse its going more expensive you limit cars most gas stations would going out buisness and car places gas stations buy the gas for cars use yeah the gas expensive but need and car dealerships would have many cars they wouldnt know what with them cause one would but them because there car would limited use there car would brand new yes people are lossing alot money from cars but its worth cause need get places you make cars fancy yeah your going have people want buy but thats because you want them buy cars are killing the environment though because the gas the people tearing into there grass people dont realize but cars should just used get places and then stay there and then when there done home mean they can make car that can scene there drunk and wont start would buy that car because would tell you not drive because eeyou are drunk that will slover many deaths and drunk driver accident problems instead making cars fast and look slicker and nicer and have the car talk you with bluetooth thats just dumb option wish they would just make cars more reasonable with things that really matter than just look nicer and more for rich people alot people can afford cars they should lower all prices and they would make more money because egmore stuff will sold like the drunk deeter car,1
the technology used the article shouldn used read students emotional expressions they shouldn because student very sad upset even angry you want know why and probably ask them why they feel that way some students might want talk about but most probably wouldn might make them even more upset angry and sad you ask whats wrong and they dont want talk about also personal issue the student having and they tell you what wrong and you can help them they might feel like they doing something wrong and get sad depressed becasue you can help them also this was used read the emotional expressions students the classroom feel like would distraction and take time out the students learning figure out how every student feeling based the facial expressions another thing could what the technology making this possible wrong you walk student and ask them why they happy but they are actually really sad what the student just changes their apperance make them look different way when they are read for their emotion the last thing what are the teachers going with the infomation how they think their students are feeling based facial expression maybe college where you want consumer something along those lines would good thing have teach you how read others emotions better but would useless middle high school classroom and just cause distractions this shows why dont think the technology would good the classroom becasue the technology could wrong students could change their appearence seem different way and useless the teachers have this information,3

our society today limiting car usage would the best way there are plenty advantages limiting car usage with decrease pollution just name one them can capitalize the downward shift automobile users the united states and around the world then would benefit all more ways then one having car can handy get from point point but what you just not need use that car all what you are just lazy walk bike your destination not saying you should walk miles your aunt house but what was just the store that was half mile away not mention that you would saving good gas money there mostly car free suburb for example germany that focuses majority the population the neighborhood not use cars this town named vauban and percent families not own car here may sound bad those who live and die their car but with everything walking distance makes easy and accessible walk from point point most the time the residents this suburb are positive about this change and they should because positive change one very large problem with the excessive use cars one area air pollution lots cars the same area commuting can create thick layer smoke the air called smog and not pleasant experience the road that being said paris had recently gotten much smog the air that had put down partial ban license plates with even numbers could not drive monday while odd numbered plates could not drive tuesday sounds crazy how could such busy city like paris realistically put down travel ban half the commuters whether you thought would not worked sure there were couple motorists who could not take for answer and still commuted when they were not suppose but large majority followed the rules this ban apparently the french government underestimated the factor these cars had the environment the ban was rescinded early tuesday for the pollution almost completely cleared away support those two points the amount drivers every year has been going down since its peak point the gap nearly nine percent almost tenth the united states has stopped driving the last years with this pattern taking place scientists believe that will only have postive benefits for the environment and the communities the forseeable future the united states one the most polluted countries the world which large part because our advanced and highly populated culture that doesnt mean cant make difference and help our community grow into better place environmentally one good example that happening the car free day bogota this city millions people got around without using cars and have been since this program has led the blooming brand new parks and repaved smoother sidewalks millions colombians can make their community better place heavily populated area should summarize plenty places around the world are making good efforts tone down car usage this helps bring down levels air pollution enhance the community that those people live and help their financial situations saving money buying car america can make these kind efforts decrease car usage our whole country would better for more ways than one,5
driverless cars can have many different positive and negative aspects about yet people only tend look the positive person brain tends shut off after being told the good things that can come something new that they don really hear the bad the product salesmen use this same technique sure having driverless car can have some pucks still just accident wheels what really the point owning even making car that doesn allow the driver even drive especially when there are many things that would have change order make room for the new vehicle the law was originally made and planned out for cars that are originally driven humans but once you get car that can drive itself then those laws will have change paragraph clearly states that even traffic laws change new laws will need order cover liability the case accident proves that the laws would have change not only for traffic safety but also what would and should happen case one those driverless cars were malfunction and cause serious accident even then who would fault the technology fails and someone injured then who fault the manufacturer could the fault had with the malfunction the car interior the engine could the driver fault she didn properly check their car buttons yet the car would still able control itself that the driver allowed many other things the case say that the driver has been drinking that night and way shape drive for certain amount drive the car can handle driving functions speeds mph they can steer accelerate and even break themselves paragraph this just shows the car many capabilities what can also the car has feature that can allow the driver turn the autopilot and allow the driver take control case needed since the car system actually safety feature and safety big concern paragraph this goes prove that drivers are safer this type car safe the car may seen can real challenge not only operate but also can just rea challenge itself werner huber who bmw project manager admits that the psychological aspects automation are really challenge have interpret the driving fun new way paragraph even bmw manager admits challenge handle such car plus should the responsibility controlling vehicle really taken away from the people those who are learning know how drive should know that they should never have the privilege the cell phone people need learn that their actions such drinking and driving texting have consequences that they should learn from paragraph states how something not available drivers trying text with cell phone well that something that one should doing the first place wonder wasn available drivers before driverless cars should not driven all the fact that there are just many risks that are being taken when such car being driven the road just creates immature and irresponsible people and too much hassle deal with even for the government that the reason why some states the are making illegal even test the computer driven cars,4
dear state senator arguing favor changing the electoral college election popular vote for the president the united states over percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have know basically this process voters vote not for the president but for state electors who turn elect the president the electors could anyone not holding public office voters cant always control whom their electors vote for voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate tie the nationwide electoral vote possible because the total number votes even number highly unlikely but one day dont change this will happen hawaii sent two electors congress could ended disaster luckily vice president richard nixon validated only his opponents electors their ever happened tie each state would only cast one vote not fair that say wyoming would get much california which has seven times the amount voters wyoming has the election only few swing voters away from catastrophe candidates dont spend much time states they know they have chance winning during the campaign states didnt see the candidates all and voters didnt get see campaign the best arguments favor are mostly without much basis reality abolish the electoral college,3
name proper name and arguing about why think driverless cars should not built personal opinion that people are the only thing that should control car that there not question what happened there was accident the article driverless cars are coming even states that these cars warn the person the car whenever they might have take over because cars can move around accident for any other reason the reason the cars this because they don have the technology navigate themselves through car accident around construction site there major traffic ahead believe that these cars are unsafe and will cause harm people because the lack fully advanced technology there are few positives about the car such being much more efficient gas the vision these cars public transportation the insite the cars that they will much more efficient than the everyday taxis that are used for transport and will much more flexible that bus transportation the only thing getting the advanced technology that need make the cars function safely without any risk accident any kind,3
dear senator belive america should keep the electoral college because the choice the pople not always the best also that how the founding fathers wrote dont know who came with the idea get rid and why also how that would help americans but think that would not very good change first all the option the public not always good some choose some presidents because there race gender the amount money they have but the should really choosing how the person reality what the shows not always true and not always nice some people dont even online research they choose this person because what they gave low income people some money and time the right president when actually that was the guys first time and may only that get the public like him there are some presidents who really out there and help but not often published while the electoral college does not vote off color race gender but where this guy has been what college hewett how offen works and what job they total background history this guy and find out president material next this founding father compromise goes back very far dont know much about the founding fathers the constitution did not pay attention much should have but know that what they wrote the wrote for the best result they wanted the best for america and its people far the rules the wrote and things they have done for those many years ago have never harmed belive that there greatness the electoral college conclusion belive the electoral college shoul stay because regular citizens are not researching and caring about who runs america the founding fathers made the right decision choosing the electoral college,3
many may argue that driverless cars will great fundamental change the world driverless cars are only helpful you really know how use them properly they are very dangerous when comes being the road around bunch other people driving already dangerous enough for young people with our phones why make worse believe that driverless cars will only make our world worse every situation you dont know how use these driverless cars there really point owning one since people have been hoping eventually have car that drives itself but dont think they actually looked the logic behind this driverless car means there really learning taking place why even have license you wont ever need because your car drives itself practically waste time another reason would not approve this evolving because just imagine all the things that could happen you are driverless car around bunch people the highway you could easily going certain speed limit and then have speed different speed and you cant that fast enough there most likely going crash does anybody see that driving and maintaining certain type composure car hard enough keeping your composure driverless car would practically impossible you can way too relaxed driverless car and completely forget pay attention your surroundings which also extremely dangerous the last reason these cars should not abolished because all know how teenagers cant wait get the road also know how much teens love our facebook snapchat instagram ect this driverless car only promotes these things while driving because the simple fact that dont have anything better with this can pay all the attention want our cellular devices and hope that nothing tragic will happen hoping isnt good enough keep everything the same will sure that teenagers pay close attention the road instead the distractions the car that being said there are many flaws this car you dont know what you are doing not put yourself that situation not paying attention your surroundings very dangerous and leads you crashing lastly distractions are big problem the united states and this car will only make them worse therefore say the driverless cars when comes down life death chose life safety always comes first,3
the artifical making mona lisa smile nick alto talks about the use technology read the emotional expressions this technology classifies six basic emotions such happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness although don not believe this will valuable the emotional expressions students classroom this technology could helpful for some but don believe will work valuable for others for example student can look down due lack interest subject and the device would predict the student was sad when they may not sad they are just not interested and considering the technology only has six emotional expressions limits the outcome how the student feeling for example the student could feeling hungry but that not one the emotions the technology has listed although this technology would valuable figuring out someone basic emotions they are too many emotional expressions that this technology does not have therefore not believe that the use this technology would valuable classroom,2
dear senator proper name name proper name and attending school name location name have recently been learning about the electoral college have been learning alot about actually and have say the electoral college sounds like really bad idea first off swing states that sounds completely unfair sure its good for states like texas california and new york but what the smaller states like montana maine wyoming even they deserve much voice the others also this presidency here not what game should play gym majority vote makes absolutely sense whatsoever mean come are deciding the next leader our country again everyone wishes should accounted for now not saying that popular vote perfect either but sure beats the college there are too many variables for the college too many areas where something can wrong something gets tied then they just throw the vote the house representives think there tie that should result election but thats probably just personally think should like the hunger games well thats really all have say hope you read this letter and maybe you can send your superiors whoever you work for get letter read the president and see can fix this problem here yours truly proper name,3
people over the years that have been talking about cars that drive themselves have found this topic very interesting because the phrase cars that drive themselves yes sounds interesting and very cool and far into the future but there are downsides this idea and there are some good sides depends the people that you ask because some could say way then there are some that could say yes way then you have think this way are these futuristic cars even safe for humans driverless cars sound really cool because then you don really need anything but sit back and watch then again just don think that would want car that drives itself only because the dangers kind puts you for example the passage states that these cars have all these sensors that can keep you safe while you driving well what you while that car driving and one the sensors malfunctions and there car running stop sign while your turn what you you won even see the car coming from the side you and that sensor malfunctioned can alert the car then you get smacked into the other vehicle these cars come with very dangerous factors and possibilities that can happen any given moment yes these cars are cool but would never get one for myself paragraph two when talks about how television and movies have been fascinated with cars that drive themselves think can bad thing for them doing that that because the way movies and portray the driverless cars unreal but others who don understand that well they could good amount danger for example the movie transformers every single one those cars drive themselves they steer themselves they can open their own doors they can all this stuff and someone who actually believes that that what these manufacturers are coming out with then they are wrong because they think that will able that stuff and while they distracted boom they just got boned another driver because the person wasn paying attention these cars could really cause lot danger society driverless cars are way too dangerous feel like people would irresponsible with them and cause harm the community against cars that drive themselves for right now until they can poove that these cars are safe like all know today there are crazy drivers out there and with them the road with car like this that could put ton people danger help prove whole point paragraph says that the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer well here the thing said the technology fails that means that there chance the technology failing and causing harm just like lot other technology can for example some sort saw cut wood metal one those things malfunctions and blade goes flying could hit someone and easily kill them not all technology fool proof that why wouldn trust this driverless car once again not support the creation one these driverless vehicles because safety issue even this car does have all these sensors that doesn mean that totally safe because you still have all these other crazy drivers the road that could potentially smack into they aren paying attention even you aren paying attention yes the movies these cars look really cool but don think that they need created and brought into real life say that just stick what already that having actual people drive the car instead having computer programmed into the car driving now know people don drive either but what the technology fails and someone dies crash then what you you definitely can blame the person for something that company made malfunctioning the people just need stop and think about what all could happen you let computer drive your two three ton vehicle,5

countries and cities all across the world are joining the car trend and seems passing fad from germany france columbia the united states everybody trying start driving less for cleaner happier world countries governments everywhere are trying get people off the roads and start biking walking using public transportation instead the people these countries have learned there are many advantages giving driving cars even only for few days rather than their entire lives the main advantage cleaner planet emissions that cars release play large role the world air pollution carbon emissions create smog that makes the sky grey damages our lungs and harms the plants that give clean air due carbon emissions from cars paris once had much smog beijing china which known one the most polluted cities the world source start driving less cars will have really beneficial implications for the environment especially since transportation the second largest source america emissions just behind power plants source imagine what positive effects banning cars would have the population and world health one positive effect would lot less stress driving dangerous activity where you are constantly putting yourself risk many people realize this and tend scared driving are constantly nervous when they drive rushing drive work time also creates negative stress says german media trainer and mother heidrun walter longer owning car when had car was always tense much happier this way daily long commutes are also large determining factor someone mood some people have drive for hours day just get their already stressful job and then again when they back home this creates for very unhappy society now there are couple good things that come from society that longer obsessed with car culture one thing that the internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people feel more connected without driving meet friends source this lessens the need have car take you distant places with the banning lessening use personal vehicles cities and towns are being rebuilt this new approach stores are placed walk away main street rather than malls along some distant highway source this has encouraged healthier and cheaper modes transportation such walking skating bicycling and public transportation such buses fewer cars and this rebuilding cities saves you money and commute time just think about all those rising gas prices you don need pay tolls when you walk get fined when you run too fast prices for parking spots and passing tolls are going anyway easier and cheaper alternative just walk bike somewhere public transportation like buses and subways cost lot less too studies have found that fewer people are buying cars and getting their licenses for reason lastly not only are leaders across the globe joining the idea life without cars but are car selling companies companies like ford and mercedes are already rebranding themselves mobility companies with broader product range beyond the personal vehicle source even bill ford executive chariman the ford motor company proposed business plan which personal vehicle ownership impractical undesirable ford suggested becoming partners with the telecommunications industry create cities which pedestrian bicycle private cars commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety source next time you think about buying new car driving work all buy yourself try rethink your actions and imagine the effect will have not only you but everyone around you maybe you can bike work not that far take the bus instead carpool with some coworkers the planet and future generations will thank you you just limit your car usage even little bit time,5
driverless cars really are not such thing the future anymore they are here and they are improving imitate human driving abilities but are humans sure that want them mean sure the driverless car seems convenient and everything but you still have pay attention the road then what the point driverless cars may seem great but they truly are not many teenagers are foaming the mouth practically get there license when they turn and some people just love drive general they would not want driven around computerized car driving yourself around passion for some people personally not think driverless cars should thing technology always getting bigger and smarter but will truly smart enough simulate the thought process human brain bad situation while driving does not seem very likely while there are many pros driverless cars there are also cons one the main cons that comes mind when think driverless car the safety mean sure they may proven safe but almost all technology messes onepoint how can the creators driverless cars say that they are completely safe for all they know there could unknown glitch their server and could cause the car crash and the driver die also the article they said they use lot sensors and radars simulate that the human vision what one accidentally broke malfunctioned but continued drive seamlessly without error mentioned the article the driver could using one the entertainment systems that they build into the car occupy the driver while the car self driving consequently they may neglect see car front them and crash because they were distracted the entertainment system and then there possible human life lost who would fault then would the company that made the car responsible how about the driver who was distracted the car entertainment systems matter who fault for the wreck the wreck could have possibile been avoided there was human driver behind the wheel these are jst couple the many safety concerns that come with the possibility driverless cars while they may advanced futuristic vehicles they seriously thought about before trusting human life with them consequently think they should kept off the roads until they are proven safe really not think driverless cars are good idea until they can prove that the technology that goes into them will run error free and not malfunction until that happens they should not allow them the roads just for the sake human lives being risk all could take single crash and while know that hasn happened yet bound and human life will lost therefore say keep them off the roads driverless cars are not for until can prove that they will not glitch mess and crash,4
dear senator strongly suggest that you keep the electoral college because the different benefits has offer creates more certain outcome also way avoid run off elections even though there may some negative outcomes this way voting feel that the advantages overlook them the electoral college good method our voting system the united states because helps develop more certain outcome according the passage titled defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president richard posner states that because almost all states award electoral votes ona winner take all basis even very slight plurality state creates landslide electoral vote victory that state this tell that vote plenty more certain using this method rather than popular vote with having more precise and organized plan voting guarantees more certain outcome and will prepare for problems that may occur such ties the election the electoral college most definitely great voting method when used for certainty another reason why the electoral college great method voting because way avoid run off elections according the same article titled defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president richard posner tells that there pressure for run off elections when candidate wins majority the votes cast that pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process reduced the electoral college which variably produces clear winner example this stated the article nixon and clinton both had only percent plurality the popular votes while winning majority the electoral college avoiding these types things very important didnt have this method would still have come with some sort method that thing like run offs don happen however some people disagree with the electoral college because they feel that they aren really voting for the candidate still needs used because many thing can happen such ties and run offs that would need figure out the long run conclusion the electoral college very important and needs continue our voting method for the united states certainty the votes outcome and avoiding run off election are twp ways electoral votes have helped without this method would have dealing with these issues some other kind way,4

having cars without drivers are big deal because according google cofounder sergey brin can envisions future with public transportation system where fleets driverless cars form public transport taxi sytem paragraph instead having drivers every car whose drivers are teens parents elderly disabled drunk who are driving everyday having car without them driving would make their lives easier which would reduce the deadly automobile accidents that are reported everyday not against the development these cars but fact support the development because instead having different drivers different cars who are driving everyday having driverless cars would provide more organized stems and more cautious sensors the cars which would lead safer environment whether inside the car outside the car while making transportation the second paragraph states google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since their cars have driven more than half million miles without crash paragraph explains that the cars has driven million miles without any crashes having driverless cars also would only use half the fuel today taxis believe the companies put more researches the cars especially when dealing with traffic issues and government allows them test the cars more often would lead another better and successful step allow driverless cars the future world conclusion for the development the driverless cars because they are more safe and they would offer less complexion for the drivers just like there are robots being invented the cars would also able drive without drivers,3
head into the future many new inventions and ideas are being created better human life one these inventions driverless car crazy and far fetched may seem computercontrolled cars may soon taking over driverless cars may one the greatest inventions recent years the driverless car could solve many problems that all encounter daily the road for example driverless cars can solve the issue speeding since there computer controlling the car will always drive the speed limit saving people money and lives also computer will never get tired there worries falling asleep the wheel which can also help prevent many late night accidents lastly driverless cars can help prevent the growing epidemic texting and driving will drunk driving with driverless cars taking over the road this can help keep everyone safe the road and prevent thousands accidents with computer controlling the car that knows everything there know about driving safely this can help insure one safety while traveling via car course there will situations that human driver more skilled than the computer such when there heavy traffic and weather conditions with time and better understanding the driverless cars will learn adapt these situations though may take some time for everyone adapt the change being full time passenger the car while computer drives will all work out for the better the long run these cars will help protect people all over and make the roads much safer place love driverless cars hate them are heading towards them and they are here stay,3
the idea driverless car has been idea only meant for science fiction films the concept the whole idea seemed though people would not see their life time until now engineers and scientists are closing the idea that self driving cars are thing today top car manufacturers are now developing ideas and ways bring closer this once fascinating dream into reality wake some day and simply send text call local business send driverless car give them ride where ever they need also the amount time saved for people not having car for their cars and take them body shops and pay high prices for problems the engine but before the idea can pick even more its popularity some people may ask what would its use there many young adults and teenagers who still have not received their drivers license and have wait parent guardian come pick them from school activity sporting event with the self driving car those people may some day just call text business operating the cars come and pick them and drive them home this method would relieve the stress the parents having drive there and wait their loved ones this method may also used replace the traditional taxi driving system the traditional taxi system was said unsafe under certain situations for example the taxi driver can manipulate the customer the customer unaware the streets and driver can then take the longest route charge substantially high price for drive that was not suppose take long with the driverless car the car will not manipulate the customer and reach its destination efficient time and price along with the amount fuel saved from the driverless car our economy may longer rely fossil fuel sufficient source energy for our cars another reason why the driverless car idea might successful the lives could save for the drivers who are not paying attention some cars may not driverless but the ones who can break before the driver can react amazing popular car with the system that the car can break before you can react subaru subaru has always been popular with its safety features but now with the newest models the car now capable stopping itself before accident can occur how this works that this car isn necessarily driverless still driver needed car but what makes this car stand out safety its sensors the front and the back the car used detect any situations actions other drivers that can start accident one scenario lady backing her car from her driveway and distracted her child the back not realizing she was still backing the car sensors detected oncoming vehicle and immediatly stopping the car the car saved the lady and her child from injury and the lady will nodal with insurance for damages and costs repairs this just one the dozens scenarios that can happen when driver not paying attention and could lead serious accidents with smart technology can save the lives millions drivers whose accidents could have been prevented conclusion the idea driverless cars still thing worked and need improvement but are not far from seeing cars without drivers driving safer and more efficiently than human drivers not mention the growth the economy will have from people switching from buses and uncomfortable rides with strangers driverless car will not harm other drivers harm how see cars instead will see them safe efficient and well protected vehicle for transportation even not succeed having driverless car still have had many advancements from keeping drivers safe and preventing accidents that could saved,4
have you ever thought world with cars driving themselves the thought not taking control your own vehicle mindblowing driverless cars the future are not good idea because the technology not reliable enough state laws will take surplus amount time change they change and technology fails the person manufacturer held with consequences will not known driverless cars the future are not great idea for the future because they are not reliable nor completely driverless within the article states google cars aren truly driverless they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents this factual information from the text solidifies the fact that the cars are not completely driverless they need human assistance order safe regular cars the present day need humans and the driverless cars there basically difference besides the fact that can drive its own for temporary amount time furthermore the cars are not great decision for the future because the state laws will take very long time change and that they change societal issues within the take many years change because goes through long process the white house and finally the supreme court not mention the state governments the article states that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times result most states illegal even test computer driven cars this evidence shows that the process changing laws will take great amount time additon when the technology fails and someone severely injured the conflict will rise because the government will not sure who punish will the driver accused the company that created the car the creation this car will cause massive issues within the court system and many societal issues the article states even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability the care accident the technology fails and someone injured who faul the driver the manufacturer this validates the reasoning why the conflicts will occur within the creation the vehicle some may argue that driverless cars will help drivers become more relaxed and driving will much more entertaining experience but this incorrect because the article states the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires this means that the human has stay attentat driving regardless the car being able drive itself overall the idea driverless cars the future are not good idea because the technology not reliable enough state laws will take surplus amount time change they change and technology fails the person manufacturer held with consequences will not sure driverless cars could helpful other ways but the primary source transportation not ethical way thinking,4

the passage driverless cars are coming article explain the topic driverless cars the future this passage explains how companies are creating driverless cars and explains how they will work the author shows the readers the positive and negative aspects driverless cars although there are multiple ways driverless cars are helping society they should not made driverless cars may help people but they are not proven all the way safe and they make harder for the driver stay focused driverless cars make harder for the driver stay focused the road driverless cars still need driver just case emergency google cars aren truly driverless they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents what roadblocks lie ahead for the autonomous car even though the author referring google driverless cars wants know how other driverless cars will similar different from the other driverless cars what happens the driver not focused when the car alerts them the author says manufacturers are also considering using camera watch that the driver are remaining focused the road while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver the author explaining how they will keep the driver focused using technology since the cameras watch and alert the driver what happens the camera not working that day what the driver was texting what will happen the driver how will they stay focused the driverless cars have postive aspects but are not proven safe the authors explains how the law focused keeping them safe most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety best achieves with alert drivers presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times the author explaining how safety acheived when humans are control the car matter what result most states illegal even test computer driven cars the author explain that since driverless cars are not proven safe they are illegal most states still even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability case accident technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer the author showing the reader the conflict between the driver and the cars driverless cars have multiple positive aspects but they will not help society until more evidence shows that they are proven keep the driver focused and proven keep the driver and others safe people may argue that there should driverless cars make the society better place but driverless cars not have enough evidence prove keep the driver focused and keep the the driver and other people safe yes companies and automakers are continuing work that they are proven safe for example tesla has projected release for car capable driving autopilot percent the time the author explaining how they are working keep the people safe but until they have found way that the cars are completely reliable and until they have solved the problems completely there should driverless cars,4
disagree with the topic about driverless cars will too much money there possibility malfunctioning the drivers still have cautious plus some the states doesnt want this even there state driverless cars are dumb and doesn any make sense this does happen our country there could some danger the topic about driverless cars will probably too much money look electric cars they lot money but doesnt use gas the driverless car you will still have get gas might take certain gas which could expensive certain part quits working the car could really expensive and you going losing lot money that way this why the united states should just stick with the same old cars that are cheaper than driverless cars another reason why there shouldn driverless cars could malfunction they been working this since and can barely drive itself the speed mph imagine just driving down the road and the car just stops could bad situation you could also just sitting there and starts going really fast and you can control this driverless car could really dangerous had malfunction when having driverless car the human being thats the car has cautious when driving the driverless car needs help traffic situations parking your car and driving through construction zone and even around accidents whats the point having driverless car you have all the hard parts why dont just have assistance with stopping when car and item behind the car even when were not paying attention when there something front honestly just need keep the manual cars and have some assistance attached because then wont have much problems and will lot safer thats why shouldn get driverless cars because still have cautious having driverless car dumb and pointless stated the car could very expensive leaving our country debt also malfunctions wont just our safety that danger will also lose money trying fix the car have cautious watching the road whats the point even having driverless car this talk about driverless cars should stop they put the driver danger and they put pedestrians danger also driverless cars should never happenin and hope they don,4
the author supports the idea studding venus worthy pursuit depite the dangers because astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system the author supported his claim telling the reader that scientists are even discussing futher visits the surface venus the author also stated paragraph today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth then the author explains himself describing the features that are similar earths venus often refered earths twin and this can fascinate readers and make them want read more the author does good job getting the reader read more comparing and telling the reader things thaat have not been able done anyone all these years done telling the reader has proved very challenging place examine more crosley also telling the reader venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closets distance too spacecraft has landed and survived for more than few hours and those are fascinating facts from the author the author talks about venus reputation challenging planet for humans study despite how close the planet this why think the author did good job supporting his idea how well the author supports his idea gave facts the planet and its similarities earth talked about being very challenging study would great accomplishment the first study the planet technology today could probably help landing and exploring planet and learn from because its similar features our travels and beyond earth should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded and meet the very edges imagination and innovation the author said this why the author supports the idea studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers,3
luke point view this story telling people that whatever something someone giving you the chance you never know what could happen after was exited the seagoing cowboys program once did already took nine trips didn like going back and forth would have been part the program this telling you that you would likely like the seagoing cowboys program after all luke point view can see you can see the seagoing cowboys program help take care the horses young cows and mules that were shipped overseas luke wanted help signed like you should point view tells you that was happy signed and doesn regret pretty sure you wouldnt either let this way for you see that you should sign,2
the author positive about the idea studying venus believing that nasa should confirm bringing scientist venus going venus has risks when comes going different planet with different conditons than earth however those decisions can come weather someone goes venus could come back with great results experiments that nasa researching the atmosphere venus dangerous environment for human kind temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater that what experience our own planet these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth this shows that venus temperatures have the risk scientist unable survive the atmosphere nasa however coming with ways send scientist venus with safer way getting information vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way not easy conditions but survivable for humans this reveals that there still chance that scientist can venus with not much worry about the author gave details why scientist should study venus the details show that scientist can venus but they can not enter the atmosphere scientist can however above the atmosphere and get research,3
think should keep the electoral college because least gives people say weather not the person they vote for gets elected not people always say that you can complain you don vote sure people wouldn want not able vote explain more detail reasonings the next couple paragraphs the first reason for keeping electoral colleges because people want say who president america was made give people freedom people being able pick the pesident big part our freedom and taking that away leaves with not much say big adhesions such presidental election the people that would probably complain the most older people because they are use being able vote and taking that away would get them angry sure and the people complain louder than they praise another reason why they shouldn take away electoral colleges because the amount compliant they would get from everyone they decide take electoral college away might even make some people turn against their country but that only goes for the people who are really into politics and voting and things that nature people say you can complain you don vote but they take that perivale away sure you hearing even more complaining than people have the right vote but even this and coming generation isn really into voting anyways but should available regardless those are basically the two big reasons why voting should available everyone and not just left senators and stuff people want say who running their country and because there will tons complaining voting taken away from them think before you make drastic desson like that,2
after reading making mona lisa smile nick alto smart decision say that valuable use the facial action coding system read the emotional expressions students classroom support this claim for few reasons the reasons support using this enhanced technology classroom environment because could help students become less confused about the concept they are learning could used school counselor office help students identify their emotions and what they feeling and lastly can keep students focused and ready learn the classroom would valuable use the facial action coding system the classroom for students because this technology could possibly help students become less confused about the concept they are learning throughout the world many students are pretty challenging classes and most the time they are smart some the things these classes however are not always easy many students struggle with the concepts they learn and are often confused with this new face reading and emotion detecting technology the scanner will able detect the students facial structure and what they show will predict these emotions imagine student learning something and she gets confused this happens all the time and most students show face that shows they not understand what going this face may look something like furrowed brow side smirk with the mouth whatever may the student confused and needs help the facial action coding system will able detect this and the teacher will see the results then will able clear the student confusion over the concept problem solved this especially would help with students that are not outgoing others and are reserved class and are not comfortable ask for help front the whole class another reason that the facial action coding system would valuable for students classroom because places like counselor office would help the student identify their own emotions lot students especially after something has happened their life that has impacted them negative way need talk someone their emotions need expressed and this new technology would help students identify these emotions picture student walking into counselor office that having rough day the student sits down and explains that she having trouble identifying what they are feeling they don know how feel about what has happened the counselor would talk the student then for extra assistance use the facial action coding system the system would then give the emotions for how the student feeling now the student will know and maybe feel better not least the emotions are now recognized identified lastly this facial recognition will able tell student class bored can also tell how many the other students are bored this can tell the teacher that maybe how they are teaching the material not the most beneficial way the students many cases the students are bored with what they are learning they may put their head down even have bland look their face when students are bored they tend give and not pay attention all and they are not motivated learn anything therefore they not comprehend the material like they need this can help teachers know that they need change their lesson plan keep the students occupied and attentive with the material they understand better this will then have the potential raise grades and more successful with the classes they are taking conclusion the facial action coding system would valuable source use with students classroom for these reasons have previously mentioned this new technology would very beneficial environment school has proved the emotions the mona lisa painting which many people are confused about clearly has lot potential this will allow students learn the most beneficial way possible and will cause them more successful the classroom and the future,4
very smart found that venus one the brightest points light the sky also found out that venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and sometimes the closest distance venus has thick atmosphere alost percent carbon dioxide blankets covering there are even more dangers venus like the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid atmosphere the second biggest danger that average temperatures over eight hundred degress fahrenheit that average temperature venus way hot for anyone survive the biggest danger that the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet and venus there signs additional impediments like erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes the biggest reason way like because venus might been the most earth like planet our solar system that why think they should try build blimp like vehicle they are trying make way that humans can venus and survive get machine that strong able handle the heat take pictures and even evidence,2
the author did not good job supporting the idea that venus worth exploring evidence provided really shows why people should explore venus anything the author explains why shouldn explore venus first spacecraft has been venus for more than few hours paragraph the author says each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours you are trying explain why should explore venus you probably should not include this information especially paragraph also the author lists lot the conditions venus paragraph and venus does not appear planet that you could live the author starts with thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus then the author continues with the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet what the point exploring venus can even live this author does terrible job explaining why should explore venus already did not want explore venus now thanks this author never want even think about going venus,3

feel like would good idea have one these schools because can one tell how student feeling any cherian day along with that can possibly predict how student teacher will react something that happens the school what another person says can also help the students with their work the computer can tell that student struggling with their assignment can give them easier question but still get the point across for the class also backed this from the article because mentions that classroom computer can recognize when student becoming confused bored another reason think woud good idea have these classrooms there are some students that learn better computer and this will help them they not understand subject there also other students that can not learn most there course online and difficult for them this system could possibly tell teacher another staff member that this student does not work well computer these are reasons why feel like would good idea have the facial action coding system school feel like can benefit some students off the jump and also feel like can help some students get where they need they are struggling,3
dear flordia senator would like favor keeping the electoral college for many purposes the electoral college know the process becoming president and some the people voting dont really know how the process works the electors are the one elect the president and not the people people vote will not have any affect the election the president the electoral college knows the process becoming president some citizens dont really know the process becoming president what the people just vote and dont know our vote counts the excerpt states when you vote for presidential candiate you actually voting for slate electors this indicates that think our vote for the election the president but its not therefore should pay attention who elect and knowing how the voting system work out keep mind that the electoral college good system and that should count them you know who elects the president well its the electoral college the one who elects the president many people think that the people choose but they are actually wrong electoral votes requited elect the president this indicates that dont really have control picking the president possible that the winner the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote but does often happen all comes down one point should let the electoral college choose who they want elect the president all want different people president but the end have too choose who will help the powerful our nation wll ruled the people and for the people,2
limiting car use can good thing and bad thing opinion think that people should able drive cars but only certain times limit pollution europe stade while their have been efforts the past two decades make cities denser and better for walking planners are now taking the concept the suburbs this storey you can teel that alot these people europe are not liking the fact that their pollution going all our development since world war has been centered the car and that will have change paragraph can agree sort with this because focus cars alot one our major ways transportation this not bad thing that have cars but need make sure that can keep the pollution down maybe using hybrid cars instead also seems that people are starting drive less nowadays and opinion because either gas prices are too high people can not afford one americas love affair with its vehicles seems cooling when adjusted for population growth the number miles driven the united states peaked and dropped steadily thereafter acording analysis doug short advisor perspectives invesment research company april the number miles driven per person was nearly percent below the peak and equal where the country was january paragraph you can see was stating how the number people driving has declined also believe the cause for this stated before due the number people who can either not afford one not want one this storey have explained how the number people driving cars have declined have also said that europe does not really like the idea the pollution they are creating since they end making much smog opinion maybe other countrys such the canada and such should consider knocking down some their driving privileges due the fact that just too loud and not very safe well creating alot pollution,3
lot peoples dream have cars that not require the passenger operate the vehicle but the same time the vehicle operate exactly how should not better than human were driving opinion bad idea for this happen there problem and there accident who blame would the person the car the manufacturer also america and eventually the world losing experience that almost everywhere and has been for long time now humanity will come one more step closer being dependant the technology around them driverless cars are bad idea have spent portion life learning about how the car were made learned about history class how and when the very first car was made and how the car has evolved over time upgrade the car where doesnt require human interaction drive then slowly humanity will forget the nesset driving will dependent our technology work for will become lazy people the cars get smarter get dumber car accidents happen all the time some more severly than others there accident and driverless car was the cause who the blame the manufacturer the driver who would fault the driver wasnt driving was just the car had control something happened the machinery does mean that the manufacturer stake are all self driving cars unsafe for all those who use them this very scary situation situation where humans longer have any control there are lots benefits self driving cars true but the negative side this far worse than the postive cant become lazy cant dependent something that may not always therefor cant put ourselves that situation there are accidents then who fault could you get blamed for something you didnt something you would stop you could but didnt know how driverless car something not need,3
the face mars has since become pop icon has starred hollywood film nappers books magazines radio talks shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for years some peole think the face bona fide evidence life mars evidence that nasa would rather hide say conspiracy theorists siad nasa the face mars was not made aliens beacuse was illusion shadows and camera the face mars was not made aliens beacuse was illusion the crises the eyes was illusion beacuse the shadows cursed the hole and how the light hitting few days later nasa unveiled the image for all see the caption noted huge rock formation whic resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth said the author willison was caused how our eyes sees our brian capital form faces anything that has human characteristics the face mars was not made aliens beacuse was shadows when viking spotted the shadowy likeness human face the shadows made the faces but realty the just rock there not face the face mars located degrees north martian ladue where was winter april cloudy time the year said author where the rock located make shade that looks like face always cloudy there the face mars was not made aliens beacuse the camper malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution eac pixel image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo the photo matter they took another picture cloudiness day and the face was kinda gone and the camera also the key the cameras coulda caused big différance the picture the face was not made aliens beacuse was and illusion the shadows and the camera the cameras was big part the shadows was caused clouds the illusion was brain game the face mars was not made aliens beacuse was illusion shadows and camper,4
people use cars everyday but limiting car usage can very beneficial there are many advantages when limiting car usage limiting car usage can clear smog reduce traffic and make people less stressed many people use cars but that number has decreased over the last few years there are many other ways get place rather than using cars are now open many options transportation cars can used but there should limits limiting car usage can clear pollution particularly smog for example automobiles are the linchpin suburbs where middle class families from chicago shanghai tend make their homes and that experts say huge impediment current efforts drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions rom tailpipes rosenthal cars are impediment the efforts trying reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the limiting car usage those greenhouse gas emissions can surely decrease lot will make the air healthier for people live and for future generations smog and greenhouse gas emissions can reduce greatly cars have limited usage not using cars can make people happy less stressed out and relieved tension people don have worry about their cars and paying for gas and other things when they don use their cars for instance when had car was always tense much happier this way rosenthal woman saying happier when doesn use his car another example good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution selsky both those claims are very true does take away stress for him while reduces pollution that win win with less stress and tension people will happier their lives and there might less problems society limiting car usage can have really great impacts people happiness reducing the usage cars can also reduce traffic making easier for other people that use cars france congestion was down percent the capital duffer percent big amount traffic pretty sure that that would satisfy alot people traffic means less accidents and less people worried about being late school work only crazy person would actually want traffic there would also less noise cars and more peaceful sounds limiting the usage cars can guarantee the satisfaction people that normally through traffic and those who don like there are many reasons limit the usage cars because there are many advantages people will less stressed and more happy there will less traffic and the air will less polluted with smog and greenhouse gas emissions the possibilites are endless very simple less cars more benefits people need realize that having cars may have some benefits when trying get somewhere but makes more sense not because there are many advantages limited car usage can benefit people many ways,5
venus one our amazing planets earth twin which one the brightest points light the night sky and one that may want look more into despite its dangers venus has misleading nickname evening star the reason misleading because actually planet venus refered earth twin because the very close similarities density size orbit and closest distance although very similar earth been one the hardest mission landings have never made human attempt venus spacecraft has survived the landing for more than few hours the article states there good reason for not attempting send humans our sister planet numerous factors have made difficult for study the planet ignoring the proximity earth and venus maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades the article states must very difficult have thorough investigation the planet can even get spacecraft land and stay for more than just couple hours there are extreme problematic issues that come with venus making difficult study and examine the atmosphere very problematic and too extreme for human life thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus the article explains now that just crazy and makes times not more more difficult for the temperatures and pressure are also extreme factors take consideration temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet the article tells and you thought you couldn stand the pressure the ocean when scuba diving even too deep the pool when swimming why keep suggesting the visits there many drastic measures take well astronomers think could have been the most earth like planet our solar system making sense why would make for great space mission could home some the near future here what they say about the planet long ago venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms life which why making more time for studies venus could amazing and maybe even crucial the article also let know that our sister planet also has some very earth like features like valleys mountains surface craters etc maybe making mission for the planet wouldn bad venus has long history and does earth they sister planets and making the visit learn more about the future could our entire future once earth totally over populated and polluted can make room and move venus doesn that sound cool studies now can and probably will determine our future and make for longer human population,4
unmasking the face mars you ever saw heard about the face mars you might think that was created aliens but actually not everybody thinks but really just natural landform few days after nasa sent camera mars look for viking spotted the shadowy likeness human face they said was huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth the authors reasoned would good way engage the public and attract attention mars soon become pop icon and starred hollywood film appeared books magazines and radio talk shows some people think that the face bona fide evidence life mars meanwhile defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars people starting believing that was evidence life mars michael malin and his mars orbiter camper team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original photo everybody was waiting see but revealed that was just natural landform there was alien monument after all even after having all this evidence people sill didn believe that not alien because they said the epicure was cloudy and could been hidden prove everyone wrong cloudless day they took second photo with even better quality the landform finally the picture could show you that was not really face but only landform many people just want believe that there life mars when there most likey not they spent lot money trying prove this everyone that there alien life the planet mars,3
venus the second planet closest planet closest the sun and has the temperature degrees fahrenheit studying venus worthy pursuit despite the danger presents because the challange and resources that may occur nasa has shown from this study that nobody has touched this planet because their preventions venus worthy pursuit studying despite the danger presents from the challenges that occur from knowing the risks people not surviving able stay planet for more than few hours makes more challenge least touch venus although the text states nasa ’ s possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray this shows that this the safest spot close enought venus the text also states the value returning venus seems indisputable from the text has shown that nobody has the problem going venus for study just the problem coming back survived and healthy studying venus worthy pursuit seeing what people are capable managing from studying venus that can pursuit many resouces that are and could presented this project nasa sees this processing challenge having resources that could processed for example the text states systems that use mechanical parts can made more resistant pressure heat and other forces having device that could help the danger and requirements could solve the solution the pressure the atmosphere nasa able get the planet there will many sources brought back for examination study for example the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters the text has shown their are many types feature explored the text also states more importantly researchers can not take samples rock gas anything else from distance from this shows that the resouces come reasonable use could increase the possibility from the study venus has shown knowing how can increase the production each challenge and resource possible completed with correct amount studying studying impacts how much you know the project process through all the steps studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the challenges and resources being presented,4
dear state senator believe that election popular vote for the president the united states the smartest and easiest way about things there are many people who believe that the better way about things given that the electoral college waste time some may say over sixty percent voters back two thousand would have proferred direct election instead voting bunch electors mean would you rather vote for one person vote for twenty six the electoral college place that the founding fathers established the constitution compromise between the election the president vote congress and election the president popular vote qualified citizens the process consists the selection the electors the meeting where they vote for president and vice president and counting the electoral votes congress the college consists five hundred thirty eight electors and majority two hundred seventy votes required for the election president each candidate running for president your state has his her own group electors under the electoral college the people vote not for the president but for the slate elector who turn elect the president the electoral college unfair the voters because the winner take all system during the two thousand campaign seventeen states didnt see candidates all richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce and the afl cio all have the same thing common they want abolish the electoral college some electors even have the nerve occasionally refuse vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please hope that explained alot how the electoral college not good way vote that way long and people might not get filled what happened who won there vote might even get changed one these days the electoral college will gone and will just the president winning having more votes dont need all that confusing way voting just simple vote and the winner the one with the most votes,2
opinion the electoral college not appropriate representation the people opinions true that the popular vote determines the representative but that does not mean that all citizen views are expressed many citizens have stopped voting because the ignorance that the electoral college one should not vote for someone they not know represent their lives the federal government the electoral college might the easiest way contract solid vote from american citizens but laziness definitely not efficient want our country running smoothly and way that every citizen comfortable with everyone needs represented many citizens will start voting when they hear that they wont pummelled with propaganda about politicians who think they know about what the people want they will elated hear that they will actually heard they will actually make difference their country the common people must represented not just advertisements the conflict between upper and lower class will end because both will able make difference the minimum wages and tax increases changing the election process the popular vote would not only represent all people but cut out the extremes all politicians must say whether they are democrat republican with popular vote can depth what the people really want like how gun restraints only extent should the poeple views most citizens aren completely republican completely democratic and that alright there are the conditions between that need addressed coming from centrally liberal family think that all elections through the electoral college are hoaxes the representatives the college and even the president are picked long time beforehand the government wants brainwash the citizens slowly turn onto their side even the government rigs the votes but says that the result completely dependant the people will still belated citizens and get them participate more the voting process,3
driverless cars can very well benfica our future but those driverless cars could cause problems with consumers and the companies selling the cars the technology needed for making fully driverless car not quite our reach but the near future might have all the technology that can propel into having driverless car the article says that the cars have now are not completely driverless and can only assist the driver that means that drivers still have paying attention and take over when the car meets road work any unexpected thing that might pop cars went driverless the driver would get bored and not pay attention the road which could lead into the car having accident the car would have have added feature keep the drivers attention while they are being drove the car the driverless cars would have impact the road laws well people non driverless cars the article says road laws would have changed cover the liability accident the road laws have changed due driverless cars what would the drivers non driverless cars the driver would have adapt new road laws focused toward cars that drive themselves the technology could flat out bust and not operate with the driver all the article states the technolgy fails then the companies who made those cars would blame which could bankrupting end company the truly autonomous car stretches ahead but grow closer each day statement from the passage that car companies should stop talking about driverless cars seem big much time and money for something that could glitch and end someones life driving assistance more what should focused towards that way the driver control yet being watched closely the car the driverless car can seen the next big beneficial thing but could cause problem with many people and companies,3
google created driverless cars they weren fully independant but they were the beginning something great driverless cars will save the lives people who would otherwise die car crash driverless cars will create jobs for people who need jobs people are getting lazier and lazier and they don want drive themselves anymore driverless cars are the future car crashes are caused when driver isn paying attention they are intoxicated this could mean the driver was texting eating changing the radio station even falling asleep the wheel with driverless cars people will able whatever they want while the car driving without worrying about crashing they could text all they want even sleep the driver just needs prepared take over the wheel the driverless car runs into roadblock and needs detour needs parked driverless cars will take people who are out with freind anywhere they want having friends the car with you one the most distracting things driver with all the talking and laughing things can bad really fast these cars will also help keep intoxicated drivers off the road some driverless cars can independently complete ninety percent the tasks required this will get intoxicated person very close their home not all the way there driverless cars will create jobs jobs programing design manufacturing and upkeep the cars some might say that driverless cars will take more jobs than gives these people say that taxi drivers and bus drivers will lose their jobs yes that most likely true but they will create many more jobs the amount jobs created will more than the ones lost spock once said the needs the many otway the needs the few the one people are getting lazier and lazier they don want drive themselves anywhere anymore this one the reasons that need driverless cars society evolves see that people are getting lazier lazy people don want drive anywhere this where driverless cars come driverless cars will take lazy people who don pay attention their destination safely and without accident people might say that driverless cars end making people lazier allowing them little nothing and still get where they want yes people might get lazier but better than people dying form crashing their car driverless cars will save lives people who would otherwise die car crash driverless cars will create jobs for people who need jobs driverless cars will also help people who are very lazy these reasons and many others why need driverless cars driverless cars are the future,5
dear state senator the electoral college process should kept because its many purposes and the fact that was established for reason since easy and simple and has absolutely hassle for counting the votes and adding the individual votes made the people the state since the electoral college process only consists electors that are selected meeting the electors who vote for the president and uce president and the counting the electoral votes the congress this easy and simple process that causes hassles since has sense democracy and organization with the electoral college process very fair since which ever candidate running gets the majority electoral votes organized system that doesn base off popularity which fair because you vote popularity and have president office that everyone voted for but running the country into the ground because terrible reasoning and democracy the people and the states are blame for voting for president who wasn guaranteed keep his her word about solving the country problems the electoral college process does need few tweaks here and there but that something take the president congress the electoral system needs fixes place such what would good for the state and changing its laws and the system being able work with the boundaries that certain states have with their own different voting process and its laws how the voting process works may also need work how the system supposed work instead voting for the people who will the electoral colleges vote for the president you would like vote for the voice the people should heard instead casted out different state electors and representatives that may see his her own views differently than the people the state,2
for the use the value this technology being used the classroom think could help students perform better the classroom think some people would find weird creepy that the computer could tell what their emotions are but think could help students and adults school the workplace could help students perform better school making there work more fun more entertaining for them when students have type research paper they are always worried about how long the paper has how hard project will this can put pressure stress students students wouldn have worry about this the computers could recognize their emotions paragraph six says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor computer could recognize that you are confused bored and for act like human instructor then this would make class work lot easier for students student was confused about something and needed help but the teacher was already helping student the computer could recognize that you are confused and could act like human instructor like states paragraph six then the student wouldn have wait the teacher and she could get the help they need this kind technology could make work for students less boring student has research paper type and struggling find information and then they start get frustrated and bored because they can find what they need computer could recognize this then could possibly help the student find information the computer could recognize that they are bored struggling find information and the computer could somehow know what they are trying research based recent searches then could pull something simile add but with links websites with information what they are researching the idea having technology like this would really useful students could make class work easier and less boring for students computer could read your facial expressions and could tell what your emotion based off your expressions and then take that information make lessons easier think would helpful lot students think lot students would find this creepy first but once they learn more about this think would valued many students think class work would easier with this technology and that why for the value using this technology,5
should able used the classroom because people like themselves the teacher should know how they are feeling today want know how they are feeling certain days and what emotions they aren having also can used science should able learn this especially sincere all have emotions and why not spice science since have science class can help learn more about emotions and how can actually can tell how are really feeling think should also have them because said paragraph classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored and think that will help cause the teachers can then see need help trying understand need take breaks becuase have became bored and confuse also would love use this find out how friends emotions are certain day because wouldnt want bother them they are angry sad would also use for teacher think would fun use school and would actually catch the children attention school opinion this would great becuase just like they used the mona lisa picture can use many other pictures and find out alot more and how people emotions were know would love use them slavery pictures,2
first while was the boat with the seagoing cowboys had many things one them was that when the animals were off the ship played baseball the ship was big enough for which was great for when the animals were learned new things about the animals the male horses were the hardest feed they always kicked but the females were nice and gentle while feed them next when went china saw many cool buildings even some that have not even been seen where else also saw the acropolis greece that was great thing see venice italy took gondola ride though the city with streets water never saw anything beautiful life then what learned this trip was that helping others that lost something war pretty fun got learn new language and what they ate before everything was taken from them doing this will help see how hard can when come and you never know that one the days you live you will feel how they felt when they lost food and home and even loved ones doing this your becoming better person and people will look you for that last with the honor this wonderful thing became honorable person even though something like this can change things and the way people look was just average boy until went the seagoing cowboys which changed how even looked people and myself doing this program will change your life and teach people how great person,3
using technology read the emotional expressions students classroom not valuable because dont think need social media tell how feel classroom setting because students know what are facial expressions are like for example happiness one the expressions that people use everyday without this technology telling are happy not which would argue against this think unreliable according the text states that moving our facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them another reason why think using this technology read emotional expression read the emotional expressions students classroom not valuable because just dont see helpful really and everybody has different emotions happy sad mad proud that why dont think this technology can help figure out emotions classroom the technology that use determine emotions classroom can through social media and how think that not helpful all for example lie detector tool tell whether you are lying telling the truth which can see helpful but really not that helpful all thats what got courts and somebody did something the classroom attract facial expression can tell the look their face and how they reacted the situation which why got counselors talk when are faced with personal issues just having one those days another reason why the the technology like facs according the text wouldnt helpful for students classroom setting because all though technology can determine facial expressions when used the rehak world dont think can determine emotional feelings students have classroom according the text states that ´´a classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts while that may sound good just think its bias and would never used because can determine humans students are confused bored how the class questions assignment the classroom technology dont think could handle what feel students emotionally the inside and outside classroom whether the whole day school the last day school this brings back point about the students being confused bored classroom really because classmate bored their expression would mad because teacher would talk lot student might take lot time with presentation talking for lot minutes another way might yawning sighing technology wouldnt help the cause emotional emotions when student loss loved one and student would have miss day because they had funeral for the person that died and anytime students here that they grieve and start crying that another reason why technology would not valuable read certain emotions using this technology like facs could not read certain emotions because number wouldnt able tell what students are feeling the classroom number two dont think would resourceful when describing emotional feelings inside and outside particular student classroom environment and the last one would that wouldnt able tell person confused bored just dont see the value technology proving anything about how students feel classroom thats why technology wouldnt valued reliable tool conclusion against the value using this technology read students emotional expressions classroom because wouldnt helpful wouldnt valued the greatest thing help determine students facial expressions like happy sad bored confused mad would waste time just using the technology for that particular situation with students classroom this technology would fail and not meet the requirements standards facial expression would advise people against the people that are for technology being valued way read facial expressions,4

feel that driverless cars are needed for the world would change the world know these cars there are sensors that can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone these cars are very important because they can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel the cars can also steer accelerate and brake themselves nut all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents even though the human driver has alert all times ready take over this necessitates the car being ready quickly get the drivers attention whenever problem occurs some manufacturers hope that bringing car entertainment and information systems that use heads displays such displays can turned off instantly when the driver needs take over something not available drivers trying text with cell phone this way the car system actually safety feature and safety big concern honestly feel that inspite some the flaws that these cars may have can still keep you safe even when you back your car will let you know your gon na hit object such car pedestrian,2

this article against the development these driverless cars because like said the article technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer that quote the article shows that there could some accident something that goes wrong with the cars there are lot pros the driverless cars but also some cons some the cons the cars can get you thinking about you really want not and its worth the money some cons the cars are the cars are not completely driverless you need remain alert and ready take the wheel any given time you are thinking about buying driverless car you need think back the pros and cons listed one con about but theres more than that like the article states that they are big safety concerns but that was true there wouldn some downfall the driverless cars you are still wanting the car how about the technology the car fails and gets you into accident you would blamed for the accident and would have pay for your car get fixed and also the other people involved there are cons there also pros that could focusing too the features these cars are unbelieveable that why most people want the car some features the new prius are rotating sensor the roof video camera the rearview mirror for more driving precautions and much more the more safety these cars have the more people will want buy them thats why they are starting work the safety hazards now the car will done the hazards are all worked out would change mind and views these driverless cars the reason why would change mind the car was safe because there would nothing that would risk losing life would think more about buying these cars before actually did would you want spend money car now and have risk taking your life you got into troubling accident wait until the problems are fixed and you have disregards about the car you will driving that why you should think before you want spend your money car that has problems for argument the aspect driverless cars vote against until everything fixed and okay drive the tenth paragraph the article states that tesla has projected release for car capable driving autopilot ninety percent the time you are looking for car now that will drive itself most the time you can get some these cars now,4
the face mars just natural landform because opinion dont believe aliens are real here are the reasons why think the face mars has become just natural landform april when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos thousands anxious web surfers were waiting for that image when the image appeared jpl web site revealing just natural landform people finally knew that there was alien monument after all another reason why think the face mars just natural planform because the face mars has since become pop icon has starred hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for years some people think the face evidence life mars april mars global surveyor drew close enough for second look they had roll the spacecraft degrees center the face the field view malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera maximum resolution rule thumb you can turn things digital image times bigger than the pixel size there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small item you would able see what they were this argumentative essay have tried convince people that the face just natural landform,3
being able have car that drives itself would cool right well maybe not cool you think having car that drives itself comes with many complications these complications may include lack safety lack total automatic driving and lack laws needed operate smart car the smart car nice invention but with the lack safety isn very smart drive the systems within the smart car may fail and cause the operator injured having the systems fail the worst thing that could happen while driving smart car may cause accident the smart car not best quality this lack safety really worries driver myself while the smart car appears able drive without driver can the smart car can operate its own but requires the operator fully alerted all times because the car cant drive itself through certain situations these include accidents and work zones which would require the driver take the wheel and drive through these situations the driver would become bored while not driving and may even fall asleep the lack action just seems way dangerous trust automatic driverless car that isn fully automatic nor driverless with life many states now don even allow many smart cars driven order for these cars able the streets many laws would need made changed without laws just for these smart cars people would drive reckless laws are put place who will held responsible for the failing the systems smart car new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident laws are needed drove these cars matter the argument keep and those around safe smart cars still seem cool leave that answer you but take everything have said into consideration smart cars may the future but the way they are now too dangerous there are too many complications including lack safety lack automatic driving and lack laws needed operate smart car smart car really smart,4
the challenge exploring venus the author does not support his idea how worthy studying venus very well even though makes some good points that would convince some people that worth the time also states some dangerous conditions that would way extreme for most people especially people who have never been space before the three biggest factors that would make most people not even thing about visiting venus the temperature the gravity pressure and the natural disasters has offer the first factor would the temperature you would feel venus our body temperature degrees the author states that the average temperature venus over degrees even with the space suit our bodies could never stand that much heat combined with the reality being different planet would much for person the second factor that would make venus not worth the time the pressure that gravity has the surface our planet can handle because are used but the gravity pressure venus times greater than the pressure that experience that would way much force being pushed down human being especially they don weigh that much the final reason supporting the fact that the author does not give enough evidence venus are the natural disasters since venus looks most like earth out all the other planets experiences the same natural disasters experience which includes erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes the spaceships that the people sent there didn survive then wouldn survive the author and also the rest are lucky that the ships that didn survive had people them these reasons make clear that the author idea venus being worthy pursuit false why this important this important becuase the future they might actually consider sending people mars and risk putting their lives stake until they are able send ship there with people them and have success then venus should not explored,3
there much evidence show that the face natural landform created natural causes paragraph seven stated that with higher quality the picture revealed the natural landform critics assume the landform alien made due the pictures taken however technology evolved over the span twenty five years the landmark was found once again and revealed the face rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were said jim gavin gavin then compared the landform mars other landforms such the butte mesa around the american west gavin also stated that landform similar the one mars was idaho called the middle butte the snake river plain idaho lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars scientists also ruled out the possibility extrastriate force creating the landform the face was first thought another martian mesa martian mesa common around the area cydonia with taking these factors into consideration the landform was simply created natural causes over the millions years,3
should keep our method chosing president even though many dont agree because few reasons one big states two avoid run off elections finaly deuteride the certainty outcome first the issue big states states are put two categories big states and small states accoring population presidential candidates give more their attention during the campaing the larger states result electoral college the big states have more electors and thus more votes for example florida the popular vote was extremly close obama who won got electoral votes obama had spent that time wyoming would have only had gotten electoral votes second avoid run off elections using the electoral college avoid the problem elections where candidate receives majority the electoral college can produce clear winner rather than pressure when canidate wins majority and complications the process two examples this and with president nian and president clinton they both had percent plurality popular vote while winning majority electoral college finally determine certainty outcome since almost all states have electoral votes winner takes all basis even the slightest plurality state creates landslide electoral vote victory tht state although possible have dispute over the outcome electoral college for instance much less likley than dispute over the popular vote and even though tie the nationwide electoral vote possible because the total number votes even number extremly unlikely happen you could argue that the method selecting president through electoral college may turn off potential voters for canidate that has hope carrying their state knowing their vote will have effect then they might have less incentive pay attention the campaing but being realistic voters one vote swings national election and about one half the eligible american population did vote election conclusion the reasons shoud kee our current method chosing the countries president because big states avoid run off elections and determine certainty outcome even though some dont agree has been working for the past can continue working for chose our president the future,4
venus the second planet from our sun each previous missions was unmanned and for good reason since space craft survived the landing for more than few hours this problem explains why not single spaceship has touched doen venus more than three decades thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus also the planet referred earth twin the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters numerous factors contribute venus reputation challenging planet for humans study even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what peole experience earth venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land its surface vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying and out their way venus was dangerous challenging for humans before land the planet scientists had study and even thought venus like earth but more temperatures the surface one cant even make its limited dangers systems that use mechanical parts can made more resistant pressure heat and other forces good thing many researchers made new upgrade machines last long enough understand venus,2
technology read emotional expression students the classroom valuable technology classroom good for students for teacher can read there emotions think would good vae them classrooms teachers should have them they can read students emotions here are three reasons why teachers hould have technology read emotional expressions the students like the teacher any other students the teacher uses the technology the students she can tell rather not the students likes her the students dont like the teacher can least try make that student like her the teacher can tell the student going give the teacher bda time the teacher emotions mean thats good know because the teacher can know what student going give her bad time the students are bad mood something they getting bullied classmate the teacher can know using that technology the student the student bad mood the teacher can sit down with that students and talk what student bully him think the teacher would find out more which students would catch the bulls think that technology would grate for school think could help the teachers know the students would get that material like they dont get the teacher can use that technology and know that student dont get the teachers would ask that student the students lie the teacher can use the technology think that would great the teacher can help the student more those are reasons why technology emotional expression should the classroom those are three reasons why,3
dear senator the electoral college very unfair many the states some states are left the dust without being visited even seeing anything about campaign also the voting misleading because they vote for electroless not the president which the people should voting for the passage the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong states under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president this information tells that electoral college wrong and should changed voting for new president left for the electors choose state pick and dont even get say the matter because can not control who they vote for and could very confusing and people might vote for the wrong person the passage the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong states perhaps most worrying the prospect tie the electoral vote that case elections would thrown the house representatives where state delegations vote the president with this information shows that the election out the people hands that are going governed but the governement that can make very bad decisions and has the united states populations fate there hands and make the wrong move and have crisis for the next four years come also the winner take all system doesnt spread equally through the states the source states during the campaign seventeen states didn see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voter the largest media markets didn get see single campaign this shows that doesn matter that the candidates get states because they only depend certain states that have alot electors like california and texas ohio the electoral college idea outdated and irrational and needs new ideas that wil make voters happy would easier just have popularity vote pick the president instead going through much chaos with all the election ther should campaigns and couple debates but then one big election that every one vote the same time elect our president this idea might help bring together the population each states decide one president run our nation the senate and the house representatives already have job and doesn need taking the job the citizens prove point passage the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong states tie would have occurred mere voters from ohio and voters hawaii had voted tether way the election only few swing voters away from catastrophe the citizens can confused and easily mislead something confusing like the electoral college swing voters can change everything this type election there can also can segregation invovled which unfair because mostly all people the senate and the house representives are white and maybe have problem with different races women becoming the next president source the last paragraph offical the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments favor are mostly assertions without much basis reality and the arguments against elections are spurious best hard say this but bob dole was right abolish the electoral college agree with this and beleive that the electoral college should abolished because unfair the voters because thet are mislead and are not voting for the president but for the electors vote for the president hope you agree with opinion and decide take this matter your own hands and make better election and happy citizens sincerely proper name,3
outside earth mystery mankind slowly through the and centuries have been exploring the space around close neighbor mars one the most famous sci planets all movies books etc have been made based mars martians even just plain old aliens have been the tall tale our time but could discovery change the argument between aliens being fake real the face mars turning point for all people scientist nasa who strongly believes that the face just landform mars surface because over time the picture quality has gotten better and has made the pictures the face come out clearer making easier see the definition the shape the first sighting picture taken the face was the viking was circling the planet snapping photos for possible landing sites for its sister ship viking when picture was snapped what looked like human face regular citizens were shocked the photo along with scientists this picture seen very blurry definition the landmark not very clear and with that picture comes many questions what this thing how did get there why there many questions that one could answer humans jumped the most conclusive answer would could come with and the answer was that was made aliens nasa quickly turned down the accusation because there was evidence supporting the idea the text the author said each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo this shows how different the picture quality between and also many people were not satisfied with the picture eighteen long years after the viking missions ended april the mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking pictures thousands people wanted see another glimpse the face maybe even better one the image appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform after eighteen years conspiracy was proven that the face was mesa conclusion the picture from how prove that the face just natural landform the picture quality has changed dramatically and has put conspiracy theorists their place strongly believe that nasa tried the peoples side afterall one really knew what the face was first continue discovering our universe will surely come across many incidents like the face and maybe one day the outcome won the same,4
have you ever wondered there life somewhere else besides earth well imagine being able know more about space and its planets knowing what like and how each planet has its enviroment but just the idea knowing more about each planet sounds amazing the author suggested that studying venusians worthy even with the dangers has supported his idea with facts opinion and examples the author supported his idea with facts gave facts that are true and explained each one one example the facts used the temperature venusians and many other facts about the planet enviroment well features about venus the author used the cats gave supported the idea that venus planet worth study and know more about another way the author supported his idea giving his opinion the article the challenge exploring venus opinion based article because gives his opinion throughout the article one the biggest opinion the author used was that thinks that venusians worth studying exploring even there danger the article talks about with evidence also includes his opinion well other people too example another opinion besides the author the astronomers included that astronomers are fascinated with the idea that venus may one day most earth like the last thing the author uses examples example how things they can use try study venus paragraph talked about how nasa working and trying approach study venus nasa has been thing boot examples project that could help them study venus without any stroble one the projects they are trying out electronic made from silicon carbide which has lasted about three week the same condition that venus enviroment another project something that has been used during the mechanical computer which can helpful well the author has developed his idea with good information well good facts opinions and examples all this shows that the author has well developed arguement that supports his idea,4
having driverless cars could bad thing for people they can rust some bad issues they not good regular cars because they not safe you get reck the company might blame you for the accident and not the car and finally the car would take the joy out driving for people who love drive the driverless car isnt safe regular car the driverless car runs sensors the text says without the option smarter roads manufactures turned smarter cars but how much smarter did the cars need for starters they needed whole lot sensors this showing that the cars would need lot more sensors which isn safe all the sensors could malfunction and then when people drive they put their lives hands these cars they even say the car would have people take over sometimes this means the hunan driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires people might start thinking they could other things now that they wouldn have drive they might read text watch videos maybe even just sleep when the car needs the human take over the human might distracted and then they crash the car wouldn safe not one bit the companies value their process their driverless cars and will pin the blame the failure someone else you got into reck and the car was destroyed who you think they going blame technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer they will course blame the car for sure but most the blame would pinned the driver for not being too alerte not focused enough people shouldn have worry about that kind law suit their hands but most likely they will finally some people have passion for cars they love building them driving them and just everything about them people start selling driverless cars instead the normal cars they wouldn doing what they love anymore their passion would gone the information from these sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and produce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone this showing that the driver wouldn have anything besides sit there and watch how boring does that sound people love drive and for most cars their passion driverless cars would just take that right away conclusion making driverless car would just bad idea because wouldn safe they reck pinned you and would taking the fun out driving away,4
the author should continue studying venus despite the dangers presents because the text talks about how they had stop studying venus since the spacecraft would not survive more than few hours what they know about venus how thick its atmosphere percent carbon dioxide and its challenging are the clouds sulfuric acid the planets surface the average surface times much more then earth and has the hottest temperature the solar system even mercury the closest its not hot venus since spacecraft survived the landing more than few hours they would stop because wouldn survive explains why they haven got spacecraft stay venus and what would have guess why they didn survive probably because how intense venus really now intense mean how strong the planet really now more then decades venus has not had spacecraft there they haven gave but they trying find way nasa working other ways study venus nasa thought about sending humans study venus but the conditioned venus makes hard because they have orbit the planet and they can not take samples like rock gas the only thing they could get study venus are images still think the author should continue studying venus despite the dangers presents,2
dear senator should change the electoral college election popular votes for the president the united states believe that everyone should have say who their future president should not just group selected officials sure some the peoples choices may end bias thoughtless but atleast they get feel their part the state like stated what wrong with the electoral college sentence those electors could always defy the will the people meaning that sometimes the chosen electors neglect their positions and use the wrong way the selected electors may end going against the people and choose bias decision matter how you look their still human and they will make mistakes electoral college shouldn only allow government official qualified citizens bare that huge responsibility because they make one wrong move then everyone will blame them but have popular vote everyone will have say the presidential voting have electoral votes your only giving specific people power while the other citizens sit down watch complete strangles balance their countries future their hands like stated what wrong with electoral college sentence the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters meaning that electoral votes unjustified the people electoral votes should abolished because isn justified for all those hardworking citizens who always pay their respects this country even states what wrong with electoral college sentence official the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational meaning that the electoral college has been here long enough not justified and irrational something like that should longer exist the citizens should have say who will become their new president they should have majority vote like stated choosing the president sentence the electoral college widely regarded anachronism meaning that the electoral college really old and longer have any need for the electoral college something that was meant for the past there may have been some sort issue that they could not properly deal with they created the electoral college order deal with but now have more advance ways doing stuff don need electoral college any more can now change our ways for voting that match our time and period electoral votes filled with holes bias should find new way chosing our new president who willing change our country for the best and not corrupt our country,4
can you imagine world with driverless cars cant the human population seems getting lazier and lazier the minute the concept futuristic driverless cars something that shouldn even considered you can never trust technology first off even make driverless car will cost fortunes cost fortunes then will cost even more get driverless car who has enough money for that will waste money secondly driverless car not safe what there malfunction and the car wrecks into walking pedestrians the roads ahead are too complicated for the driverless car steer itself that puts the passangers risk currently all the driverless cars are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills what the human doesnt respond because she fell asleep that something you have consider lastly there will tons liability sues something goes wrong the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer why would anyone bother through all this considering that half america obese why would anyone want continue add the problem instead people being lazy and wanting driverless car they should just walk where they need feel that driverless cars are bad idea they dont solve any problems they just add more problems driverless car will very expensive they arent considered safe and there will alot lawful problems one should even consider going through all that you can never really trust technology,3

years ago there was abnormal structure discovered nasa viking space shuttle was circling mars find possible landing sites for suiter ship viking when spotted the abnormal structure this abnormal structure was called the face mars that stretched out two miles from end end located cydonia shortly after was found scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh the first pictures the face mars was taken nasa viking but few days later nasa unveiled the image for the world see and told people was just huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth may nasa revealed the face mars just mesa the pictures were reviled the jpl web site the face mars was just natural landform and that there was alien monument after all april mallin team captured photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution each pixel the photograph spans meters compared the meters per pixel the best viking photo there was object this photograph like planes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were said garvin conclusion the face mars not real for just natural landform the red planet the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common haroun the american west says garvin many people believed that this photo was created aliens but have pictures and space shuttles out there prove the face mars just landform the red planet,2
against the value using this technology read student emotional expressions why because computer can read students facial expressions then the computer can stickley see them and that means personal space for the students while shows just how much this computer can imagine computer that knows when you happy sad also choose disagree not having this techonology becuase the computer can tell your facial expressions then when you get bored class then the computer can see that and get you off topic while class student can become easily distracted and token another site classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective himan instructor the same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games video surgery therefore crossed for many reasonings and with them stay the same having this kind technology good have but not helpful all classrooms,2
opinion think driverless cars are kinda cool because the fact that the driver doesn have much the driving alot people can get tired while they are driving where their destination man people have pull over and stop motels hotels get sime rest but with driverless car the owner can their destination without having stop anywhere with driverless cars you have think about the facts that agt any time the car shut down and stop working but the car can alert you anytime telling you that there problem with the system something the text provides lot interesting facts about theses types new cars and how several companies are the process testing them out the text states that google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since after google did many other places started follow after them like bmw who created the traffic jam assistant which the car alerted the drivers when they needed take over then developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger backing into object the driving laws focus more keeping the drivers passengers and pedestrians safe and that was one the major goals these companies wanted achieve and they did tesla made project that this year release for car capable driving autopilot the time the cars they plan working are mercedes benz audi and nissan drive themselves hopefully the future people will for driverless cars like because the have some good benefits human life the future people can read articles about the cars they want background checks they want would love the fact that would not have drive the entire time was planning long trip lot people will change their minds about driverless cars the future because did,3
against the development driverless cars think they are not good idea for three reasons theft technical difficulties and risky actions first reason theft somebody could steal one and just leave off with the car for example robber comes out bank see driverless car hops and leaves off with also think easy for people steal them because since its driverless they probably wont need key they use sensors second reason technical difficulties choose this reason because our world people build lot stuff but there always problem technical difficulty having driverless computer working cars can very risky according the story driverless cars are coming quote paragraph states they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents what the car has technical difficulty from the rain usually technology doesn work well when its wet say was driving driverless car the store and started rain want turn left but instead turns right and crashes into another car then wouldn want buy driverless car more because this dangerous situation last reason risky actions there possibility that person can get injured die from driverless cars according the story driverless cars are coming paragraph state the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer feel like would the manufacturer fault because they the one who made and sell the driverless cars shouldn the driver fault because they driving they put they trust into the technology hoping will get them from point point safely this technology does fail there possibility that someone families could injured die from this risky situation dont think driverless cars are safe our world have had lot technology that had technical difficulties too risky and can put people danger harm way should stick humans that are skilled driving,4
the author makes good reason why people should study venus talking about the certain type things there venus also explaining how could help others have good idea traits also good because how the author says challenge others can see like was impossible and try for themselves hard but won impossible for venus explored even more also could the next thing that could experiments and find out ways use the planet the author makes good idea that venus worthy study because talks about the comparisons earth and venus which makes curious for people find out what are the comparisons and also could find out the differences too according the text says today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters this explains that there things from earth that are relatable venus and people could research how they familiar and how they different from earth important know because you see what venus has and you just learn more from what from earth another way the author makes good idea that venus worthy study because helps others have good idea about venus and traits about itandje the challenges the author makes good point about how did search avernus difficult but worthy for you know example the author states thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth this means that you were examine venus you challenge with climate while doing research and exploring another example solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans this means that difficult able out and see what the material and objects venus like the author helps the people that want see how venus and could help them and research could good exploration since really hasn been searched and why not now some people could curious and might want know how planets other than earth and learn something new from that why venus should explored people that give informational bout space and planets,4
this story explains how fascinating venus venus was compared earth they have explained how close was earth venus has lead human curiosities venus planet that deserves examined because how unique venus and earth were compared the comparison with venus and earth was that they were both had largely covered oceans venus also has some features that are analogous those earth but the difference between earth and venus that not single spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades venus was challenging planet for humans study unlike earth they had explanation how close venus was earth was referred earth twin because how close venus was earth terms density and size was also closer distance earth space terms venus was right around the corner sometimes mars the closest planet they were closer earth different speeds humans had some curiosities about venus the story explains how nasa was studying venus the curiosity for humans would lead equally intimidating endeavors scientists would need get close and personal despite the risks the conditions for venus were not easy the story explains how venus truly fascinating have compared venus earth informs how close earth venus explains why humans have curiosities for venus the story explains why venus worth studying and exploring,2
agree with the author like says studying venus horthy the dangers presents also agree with him because the paragraph says that venus one the brightest points light the night sky that means that they are really fascinated study venus the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors the travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation according the article venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too sometimes because the changes speed the orbit are closer mars and other times venus because the change speed previous missions were unmanned this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades some the qualities venus that really amazing venus thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets the more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venu atmosphere the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater that what xperience our planet that means that these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth also venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters according the nasa has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans study venus nasa ossicles solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray conclusion scientist should venus and keep studying researches are working innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute meaningfully our knowledge venus also venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions the challenge presented venus has value that why studying venus worth the dangers presents,3
unmasking the face mars you ever wonder the face mars just landform created aliens think that the face mars just natural landform think that because the first image appeared jpl web site revealed that the face just natural landform and there was alien monument after all the first reason think that the face just landform because the text says that the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural land from also said that there was alien monument after all that proof that the face mars just landform another piece evidence that the face mars just natural landform says the text that had roll the spacecraft degrees center the face the field view even though there isn that much proof that the face mars just natural landform but still believe that because could always find more evidence each year just gave some proof that the face mars just natural landform and isn created aliens even thought there isn that much proof that just landform could still just landform with evidence research and spacecraft pictures could prove that just landform and not something created aliens,2

some people say that the face mars was made aliens but what the face really natural landform the martian equivalent butte mesa also known landforms that are common around the american west martian mesa are common enough around cydonia for presentable answer only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh the reason that the rock formation resembles human head because shadows the shadows gave the illusion eyes nose and mouth scientist only gave the name face mars because would good way engage the public and attract attention mars the scientist went back mars and found the face and took another picture clear sunny day you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were this shows that the face mars just landform and that there egyptian malians mars the rock formation just has wierd shadow that gives the unusual nose eyes and mouth formation,3
the landform that looks like face earth there are many landforms that might look like person thing mars there landform that looks like face this face has had several photos taken viking mars global surveyor mgs and another mgs the face looks like face because its characteristics although looks like enormous head really just mesa butte landform that happens look like face one reason that this landform not face because nasa revealed close picture the face revealing only landform that picture had caption that stated huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth before there were pictures that weren high resolution looked like face but now proven just landform this shows that the landform that looks like face just landform since there photo that shows what the face actually this means the face just mesa butte another reason why this face just natural landform because this landform cydonia where mesas are common the text states scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharoah this shows that mesas cydonia are common also the mesa just had unusual shadows that gave the appearence face this means that this face was just landform another reason that some landforms like earth look like something other than landform the text states reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin this shows that some landforms can represent look different from what really this would the face oon mars that landform this wouldn face though some people like conspiracy theorists may say that nasa wants hide type evidence for life mars they are wrong the text states some people think the face bona fide evidence for life mars evidence that nasa would rather hide say conspiracy theorists the text also states meanwhile defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars nasa responds conspiracy theorist this way because nasa were responsible for discovering life mars they would benefit this shows that though nasa would like responsible discovering life mars nasa just wanted prove that this face just natural landform overall there are several reasons why this face just natural landform one them that nasa took picture the face revealing just landform another reason that mesas are common cydonia the area where the face was found another reason that this landform like others can look different from what really conclusion the face mars just landform,5
driverless cars are exactly what you would expect them cars that will drive without person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions the vehicle the idea driverless cars going developement shows the amount technological increase that the wolrd has made the leader this idea driverless cars are the automobiles they call google cars the arduous task creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet the developement these cars should stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur one thing that the article mentions that the driver will alerted when they will need take over the driving responsibilites the car this such dangerous thing because all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn something interesting hard draw their focus somewhere else the article explains that companies are trying implement vibrations when the car trouble their are some people out there who not feel vibrations and therefore would not able take control the car when needed the article also states that companies are trying put car entertainment into the car while being driven this just another thing that will distract the person who supposed ready all times take over driving when asked another thing that can wrong with these cars any type technological malfunction every person with any kind technological device has experienced some sort error now imagine your car has error technologically and takes the life one your loved ones the article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings the car and that what helps car drive without true driver behind the wheel those sensors could have malfunctions and sensing something that that even there and make left turn into foot deep lake the vibrations that cause the driver notified drive could malfunction and now the driver has way knowing that the car trouble and now you the driver and the rest your passengers are being buried your local cemetery one last thing that the article mentions negative about the developement driverless cars who blame for the wreck there were possibly some sort technological malfunction even some sort human error when taking over the driving aspect should the manufacturer the car blamed should the driver one knows because there many different factors that attribute who assign the blame some what will have made judgement call when comes insurance and having pay for any damages you not want someone have make some sort judgement call what that judgement call that was made was the wrong call now there are going even more lawsuits today our courts than there already are this problem alone will just lead many more issues today the world that should not have dealt with with all these things that could possibly wrong with these driverless cars there way that the developement them should continue any further today society something bad could happen something could wrong will happen and will wrong there are just way too many safety hazards that come along with these driverless cars becuase all these problems that arise with the cars just gargantuan risk implement these cars into our lifestyles,5
exciting alien formations mars would claiming the face extraterrestrial origin like stating old faithful was dug cavemen nature can take plethora exotic forms know this from exploring the many natural wonders our own world earth that why can jump irrational conclusion when faced with irregular occurance you see from non subjective view point there face all there area your brain dedicated breaking down the world around you and associating with familiar objects and patterns this why you may see rabbit amongst the clouds butterfly ink blot test when came low resolution image martian rock formation with conveniently placed shadows only took fraction second for our brains automatically associate its appearance with something humans see everyday face reality there more face the face than there angel abstract painting furthermore evidence from nasa most recent exposition has highlighted the martian formation for what truly compliments rapidly evolving technology mars global surveyor mgs sent captured brilliant high quality image the face with the camera meter per pixel resolution greatly shed more vivid light the planet comparison the original meters per pixel camera used the viking now the formation could identified natural butte mesa mars very similiar the rock formations one would find western regions the united states since know such rock forms are created natural processes such erosion the theories aliens can firmly put rest will not completely disperse the possibility foreign life forms outside earth however the face definitely not product ancient civilization new data gathered about the red planet more anomalies will inevitably arise curiousity the essence human nature will undoubtably explore each mystery and may yet come across new signs life despite being just rock the face had positive effects sparking the public interest mars perhaps one day very soon have humans walking amoung the planet rust colored surface trekking into the unknown,4
what would you you saw face mars twenty five years ago found landform that looks like face mars surface big ovule that looks like has eyes face and nose the face looking right out into outer space and has vew the whole solar system when the nasa spacecraft called viking taking pictures spots were its sister ship could land viking was the face was looking them there not face mars just landform with shadow that makes look like face there must have been degree surprise among mission controllers back the jet propulsion lab when the face appeared their monitors paragraph three says that few days after discovering the face they set out for all see and the caption noted huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth the face mars has since become pop icon april when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time and took pictures with there mars orbiter camera moc they revealed that there were aliens and that was just landform paragraph eight says that not everyone was satisfied the face mars located forty one degrees nort martian latitude where was winter april cloudy time year the planet skeptics said that perhaps the the alien markings were hidden the haze rule thumb you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size added there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids you could tell what they are what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around american west this pictures shows face but just landform with shadow making look like has eyes mouth and nose people think that aliens are making signs saying that this land theres but its just landform nothing more nothing less april cloudless summer day cydonia mars global surveyor moc drew close enough for second look had roll the spacecraft degrees center the face the field view said garvin malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo the face mars has starred hollywood film appeared books magazines radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for twenty five years some people think the face bona fide evidence life mars evidence that nasa would rather hide say conspiracy theorists meanwhile defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancien civilization mars but there such thing aliens nothing can live mars any other planets besides earth some scientists think that the face was alien artifact photographing cydonia became priority for nasa when mars global surveyor mgs arrived the red planed sept eighteen long years after the viking missions ended,3
there are many advantages come from not using cars your main source transportation cars pollute the earth cars are also very stressful all technology stressful why not use better modes transportation bikes are healthy biking also helps reduce stress does walking walking far the best mode transportation who doesnt like walking its healthy its fun plus doesnt cost any money you dont have have thousands even hundreds rollers walk you have have money buy cars you have have money buy bikes even though bikes are better cars and also does absolutely nothing our ozone layer all all cars arnt what they are cracked they are stressful and they are slowly but surely destroying our world cars are expensive you have pay gas insurance you havent paid the whole thing off yet you have pay car note cars have their advantages they have their pros and their cons their cons otway their pros start walking riding bikes using trains because believe not those options are way better than using cars fact they help you lose weight which plus they also helpe weight off which another plus,2
imagine world where there were less accidents less pollution and faster transportation for everyone this may sound too good true however this just might reality the near future many car manufacturers have been pushing have autonomous care developed and sold while some people may not convinced these claims autonomous cars are stepping stone towards safer world the main reasons why these cars would beneficial for our future are increased safety less pollution and faster transportation the first advantage safety who doesn want live safer world autonomous cars can greatly increase the safety transportation all got autonomous cars that were all programmed nearly the same they would drive themselves safe way and less accidents would occur for example many deaths occur the due drunk driving wreckless driving however with these autonomous cars can prevent these factors from claiming lives next less pollution wonderfully positive characteristic these cars these autonomous cars use half today taxis this would decrease the amount fossil fuels being burned which will greatly decrease pollution caused automobiles these autonomous cars were furled some other resource that harms the environment little not all pollution would drastically decrease the future cars may never cause pollution again this would help conserve our planet and insure that our children children will live safe world finally the last reason why autonomous vehicles are good idea faster transportation someone were road trip their way important meeting out state your just extremly tired the morning autonomous cars can help human navigation required some situations however may not come that often you ever get tired while driving for many hours the autonomous cars can help take you your destination this insures faster transportation and increases safety many people have drive for many hours day when these people start get tired they slowly drift into sleep this could cause many accidents autonomous cars can eliminate this problem immediatly and will also increase the amount time you drive you can get your destination faster clearly autonomous cars are the way the future may take while for these cars developed but the advantages are too great over look can saves lives with the save autonomous technology the cars use drive themselves can save our planet creating less pollution and can travel longer and faster should encourage car manufacturers create these cars can life better life,4

this article making mona lisa smile the author described how new technology called the facial action coding systems enables computers identify human emotions this technology could used read the emotional expressions students classroom but should used classrooms one reason why should very simple this technology stated huang paragraph classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored this would eliminate the struggle feedback for teacher teachers not know exactly how student feels about the lesson because most human communication nonverbal the computers would able tell the teacher whether not the students are understanding the lesson another reason why would valuable for these computers classes that teachers would able eliminate the struggle having believe students even though humans perform this same impressive calculation every day but the reason hard for the teacher that most would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc example this would student said that they had not been able their homework because someone their family died without the computer the teacher has make decision whether not let them turn late which can hard and just small example with this technology teachers would able tell whether they are lying not the reason the student could get away with this technology was not being used would that they could sound serious about and they could have serious look their face because most human communication nonverbal these computers could tell that person actually lying calculating muscle clues the last reason about safety students and faculty schools classrooms were have this technology sure people with depression and other serious issues would able get the help they need the computers would able tell the percentage someone severely sad very angry this would ensure that people that work study schools are much safer than without the technology however this technology still slightly new and probably expensive schools may not have enough money purchase one more these computers even though seems work very well still can fooled the reason for this that according the facial feedback theory emotions moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but may even help produce them also the technology only has six basic emotions which may not enough conclusion this technology would very valuable schools and classrooms even there are some set backs even though may expensive now maybe one day all schools could use this technology this technology would save lifes and minds students and teachers,5
all our development since world war has been centered the car and that will have change david goldberg automobiles have been major impact today technology the creation the car was huge turning point history even though this machine has been such amazing creation still causes lot damage society cars affect both the environment and humans the limit car usage would great because then the amount pollution would decrease less traffic would occur and makes way for alternative transportation opportunities the united states the environmental protection agency promoting car reduced communities the reduction cars can lead the reduction greenhouse gas emissions according elisabeth rosenthal cities are choking due the increase number emissions paris had hit near record pollution which lead enforced ban partial driving clear the air the global city acording robert duffer paris typically has more smog than other european capital bogota colombia there day called day without cars there they only let buses and taxis drive around and their goal promote alternative transportation and reduce smog anybody goes against this they would have pay good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution said businessman carlos arturo plaza this day became really big colombia and improved their cities overall look furthermore the limitation car usage would decrease the amount traffic traffic going issue everyday life people arrive late work school wherever they need due traffic accident during the day without cars colombia millions colombians hiked biked skated took buses leaving the city devoid traffic jams traffic jams are usually stressful that gets reduced with the limitation car usage then stress levels get reduced well causing mentally healthier people traffic jams also occur due accidents car accidents are one the many reasons why people end hospitals get sued get hurt loose money with the limitation car usage all these issues will resolved moreover new alternative transportation vehicles can come into play with the reduction car usage there plan where they want suburbs play much larger role new six year federal transportation bill approved also during the day without cars the goal promote alternative transportation lately new transportation vehicles have been discovered and created some include flying car elevated train that gets you from point point seconds and new hybrid cars technology keeps progressing every single day today people may driving their normal suvs but tomorrow they could driving the new high speed flying ferrari people are always keeping mind while creating these machines about how will affect the community and the consumers since obvious that the environment isn healthy was before they must make sure that these machines limit pollution and emissions that affect the world negatively overall the limit car usage would good thing time goes people may not even need cars anymore move from place place everyone works together solve these issues then the world would become much better place the final goal get rid all the bad emissions and issues and just stick what best for the environment when the environment healthy the humans are healthy,4
what are your thoughts the face mars think just natural land form think just landform becuase earth has own form like mountains could just mountain there could other theories that isn landform but think that what and here why earth has tectonic plates mars might too far haven found existing life any other planets other than earth martians couldn have built something like the pyramids start off earth has tectonic plates have known about them for many years and know that the plates are always moving with the plates always moving that what formed the himalaya mountains and what causes them continue getting taller think the face mars just and example tectonic plates that are constantly moving and making the face more defiant every few years just the same way the himalayan mountains not every year see direct change height with just our eyes have measure out find out how much those plate tectonics have moved that what believe happening with the face think that since aren able view every year and measure how much more defiant that the year before has even changed there two sides every argument here the other side the face hasn changed could just assume there was life mars that built but technology increases and can have better view the face and see how much more defiant was from would more logical idea think that just the planet moving plates shifting since april was cloudy day and winter perhaps alien markings were hidden the clouds although continued reading the passage april cloudless summer day cydonia they were able get second lookie the face the resolution was much better and you could see the image more clearly garvin said rule thum you can discern things digital image times bigger than the airplanes the ground the egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were the picture actually shows the martian equaling butte mesa landforms common around the west america since the photo can high amounts resolution and should able see there proof marian life and their buildings don think real thing right now the face looks like natural land form conclude argument that the face just natural landform would have say even though there are some conspiracy theories only one thing can proven correct science earth has tectonic plates and there great chance mars does then only thing that could lead anyone belive there was life mars would the one photo that was taken april when was cloudy and winter lastly there hasn been any evidente life mars any other planet therefore was just natural landform the planet,4

think driverless cars will good idea for the world driverless cars would help younger people driving also would better for the economy last would better gas shows the text have more reasons but these are best reason driverless cars would help youngers people driving because younger people have higher ricks getting accidents them being their phone much for example younger driver gets text while driving nine out ten them would read the message and send one back while driving which could lead accident also younger drivers are not prone their surroundings having driverless cars would better for the economy the price the cars being more than regular car now days parents children would buy the cars their children will safe getting place place every parents wants their child safe all times also could help the usa from being dept with other countries last would help the economy having increase the market the driverless cars would better gas the story driverless cars are coming talks about how the price the driverless cars would half the price now the driverless cars would run longer without having refilled the cars would get places that are far faster than regular car because regular car would have stop more fill their tanks leading them having spend more time get their locations that why think driverless cars would better than regular cars they would better for younger drivers would help the economy better too also would better gas there are many more reasons why driverless cars are better than regular cars these are most important reason why driverless cars are better hope you agree,4
the author supports the idea that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers represents because the amazin venus has that different from out planet and why venus important part our solar system and important information and details about venus that good know the reason why this planet important even know all the danger this planet have like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes this planet helps make our solar system the temperature this planet different from our other planets and the conditions venus that far more extreme and harder live and the enviroment around venus venus has some many resources and details that intelligent learn about and how venus became apart our solar system and became planet also scientist are trying find away send humans venus find more details and important artifacts learn even more about our planet venus can gain more knowledge about this passage the challenge exploring venus gives details how the planet can dangerous but this passage also gives details how much this planet has offer and the reason why this passage important and all the things found out about venus from the passage help gain more knowledge and important information about venus,2
venus very interesting planet venus sometimes called the evening star one the most brightest light the sky some people believe that venus star but planet our solar system venus also the second planet from the sun venus the closest planet earth terms density and size one reagon becuase some astronomers are fascinating venus they also believe that venus have been one the earth like planet they believe that venus had largely oceans and that there have had been life before that don know about another reason why nasa wants venus becuase they saw that venus had surface rocky sediment and seem like valleys and mountains seem there this makes nasa even more interesting going there going venus can very dangerous the excerpt says that the regular temperature planet degrees fahrenheit and venus times greater thse conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth but they are still willing take risk the astronomers are willing take the risk trying venus find answers there questions this big challenge for nasa hopefully one day they would have the resources venus,2
the automotive technology today very complex far the car flexibility and technology within that makes smart this includes its self parking and driving abilities that makes almost driverless but how much driverless there are many factors driverless car that our current cars posses but really there would need better technology for truely driverless car driverless cars are the near future but not portrayed the smart roads are too expensive and too massive upgrade our roads now the smarter cars still need human driving cases smarter maneuvering like around accidents and such that the smartest the car couldnt itself mostly driverless car more reasonable with the technology have cars are virtually almost driverless but the driver hence needs driver needs alert and take over when its needed like maneuvering around things noite programmed function around the car that needs smarts more that the technology has driverless cars would need self aware technology that technology currently have possesses the smart cars would have have far more complex programming the sensors driving assisting only far assisting maneuvering congested traffik and parking there also alert system object another car colliton self braking which large aspect driverless car perhaps there change the destination path driverless car would need able change its course but many instances like blockage oir accident would eed programming move through around that only the human driver can posses the knowledge doing what would the car another car collided with and damage the car operated itself nearly driverless cars are the future but dont believe will create the technology have virtually driverless car,3
the electoral college good thing majority would say and that non democratic method selecting president many believe this system should changed not really accurate way show what the majority wants and that the president the united states should chosen through the popular vote what there tie the electoral vote the case tie the election would given the house represenatives given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress this isn really and accurate reflection the will the people the electoral college system that has voters vote for slate electors not the president you lived california for example and voted democrat you actually voted for slate democratic electors pledged the democratic party these electors they won the statewide election would then congress and the democrat candidate would recieve the vote these electors anyone not holding public office can elector and depends the state how they are picked sometimes the presidential candidates themselves choose who the electors are voters can always control who the electors end voting for course the electoral college method has its upsides being that with this system place the outcome the election more certain course dispute over the outcome possible did happen but less likely than dispute over the popular vote however can argued that this method can turn off potential voters for candidate who has hope carrying their state democrats texas for example republicans california these voters knowing their vote will have little effect would have less incentive pay attention the campaign than they would the president was chosen through the popular vote the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters most states have winner take all system place which means that they award the winning presidential candidate all the electors votes because this candidates dont spend time states they have chance winning they choose mainly focus the undecided states some cases states don get see the candidates all during the campaign even single campaign short does the electoral college work some ways yes but many ways the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational the electoral college should abolished and the decision who becomes president should left the popular vote seeing more accurate representation the collective will the people,4

venus otherwise known the evening star the closest thing earth far the base planets often called earth twin even doesn seem that way the surface temperature nearly degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times that earth this being said scientists are still fascinated venus could have been just like earth long ago despite the dangers presents studying venus worthy pursuit because could lead many scientific discoveries and set foot another planet and gather data and see what happened venus and possibly find out how prevent from happening earth even getting venus may seem like stretch but keep mind that times the closest planet which important considering the long time frames space travel furthermore even with the harsh surface temperatures there way around vehicle hovering venus would still able get data about the planet without burdening itself with the the tough conditions even this can only provide limited insight scientists are working everyday technology that lasts long enough able get meaningful samples such soil rock and gas for example nasa has developed simplified electronics made silicon carbide that have been tested venus like conditions and they lasted about weeks the harsh temperature and pressure another project looking the past mechanical computers computers that don use electronics but use gears and levers make calculations they could made withstand the conditions venus while also taking data and making calculations for study although there are many challenges that need overcame and scientific breakthroughs that need discovered before even think about sending anything venus studying venus worthy pursuit because the discoveries could hold from regular rock and gas preventing catastrophe scientists should continue study our sister planet and see what really beneath the surface,3

limiting car usage has lots important advantages limiting car usage can lower harmful greenhouse gas levels reduce smog and improve our environment and society wont happen immediately but believe that start limit car usage that will greatly benefit the world begin with cars cause lot the problems are having with harmful greenhouse gas passenger cars are responsible for percent greenhouse gas emmissions europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states paragraph source greenhouse gas emmissions are extremely harmful the atmosphere the greenhouse gases harm the earth atmosphere and humans need the atmosphere protect from harmful radiation limiting car use you are technically saving the planet and everyone second all cars cause smog smog extremely harmful breathe and also bad for the environment for example paris france the government enforced driving ban alleviate the thick smog after few days less cars the road the smog cleared source this proves that didn have cars the cities that have smog such beijing and paris then smog would much less problem and cities would much more healthy and safe place live therefore limiting cars results less smog the last reason that limiting car usage beneficial that will improve the environment and society parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced broad smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped source this shows that reducing car usage has helped the city economy and created better place live for its citizens bill ford executive chairman ford motor company envisioned world where personal vehicle ownership impractical undesirable saw world that would save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety source this shows that reducing car usage the environment and society can improved drastically all all strongly believe that reducing car usage can make the world better place doing can limit harmful green house gas reduce smog and change society for the better these are only few the advantages limiting car usage but you can already see why such good idea hope you can take this information and make the world better place,4
after reading the article driverless cars are coming developed own opinion driverless cars opinion driverless cars that agree with the development driverless cars because seems like good idea and believe that they are something that people would want buy the article features plenty information support claim including why driverless cars are good idea and how they will help our everyday lives the first piece evidence favor driverless cars comes from the information that google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since the fact that google has been working driverless cars for long proves that driverless cars are good idea this because google has been working this technology for the past seven years then that means that they have been constantly improving their product and that pretty far into development period that means that the cars are able manufactured pretty well this point even they not perfect which helps prove that with that much work done the cars have many improvements from the original product and will easier manufactory and sell the future computer driven cars have been production least idea some the major car companies minds since early the sensors that use computer information stop control the car have been worked since the since driverless cars computer driven cars have been idea for long then means that they probably will continue remain idea that companies will try and harness the idea and development related the idea has been going since the there almost not doubt that will not stop being studied and developed can last sixty years then probably will not disappear anytime soon driverless cars are here stay driverless cars also show the ability assess the situation therefore giving them better chance being able stop accidents before they happen they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accident the ability assess the situation and inform the driver very important feature this may also helpful preventing car accidents and the injury deaths that occur from them since the driverless car has safety precautions makes good choice for the road and proving once again that development for these cars should continue four states have already approved the limited use driverless cars california nevada florida and the district columbia have lead the country allowing limited use semi autonomous cars this information helps prove that the idea that the idea driverless cars slowly but surely being accepted california and florida are large states that have large population and get lot tourists every year nevada contains los vegas another huge city and place where lot people got gamble finally the district columbia houses some the most important buildings and artifacts the american government these are all states that mean big deal and since they have accepted driverless cars that means that they could spread extremely quickly the other states some the biggest most populated and most important states can accept the cars then that means that the bettles almost won and proof that driverless cars are good idea most car companies are jumping the bandwagon and are beginning work making driverless cars the ones that are mentioned expect have driverless cars available the next five years large scale car companies like tesla audi mercedes benz and nissan are all planning releasing cars this means that those large scale companies have realized that driverless cars are good idea and they not want miss out those mass producers usually not plan manufacturing something unless they believe will make decent profit saying that they are going work these cars these companies are saying that they believe that driverless cars happen something that they believe lot consumers will want buy this proves that driverless cars are good idea because means that people are interested them and believe that they are good idea,4
the facial action coding system useful yes would useful because people might able into things that they would probably get board with students may finally willing learn stuff thier own instead being forced learn something they are not interested this can all come true make the facial action coding sytem available stores around the world the facial action coding system program that can read person emotions when person frustrated the program can alter the screen help the person better understand something help them become less frustrated this program can also inform teacher that student does not understand what they are doing this also can help the teacher his her job better the advanced science the university illinois working collaboration with prof are developing better ways for humans and computers communicate this program able help read emotions and determines what person feeling does this reading complex algorithms that were also used decode mona lisa smile this program picks the smallest details like when you raise the corners your lips also can pick when you squint your eyes you produce wrinkle called crowsnest the coroners you eyes this program should available stores world wide because could create solution much confusion and frustration this program could make people want learn stuff also this program can cool and fun for people try another thing would that forensics caan use this tell what people are feeling and determine the are nervous about something not,3
the last few years vehicle emissions have been heating and even destroying our atmosphere cities and even whole countries are taking precautions lower the amount fuel emissions recorded the air not only that people are trying cut back help the enviroment they just arent driving much anymore for some reason even areas that driving would more useful than other forms transportation you may want cut back after seeing why they did too germany there suburban city that has given their use vehicles one the local residents stated when had car was always tense much happier this way you may not notice but the hustle and bustle everyday life and commuting may just putting more stress you cutting out personal commute will not only making your life less stressful will also help clear the air some cities well passenger cars are responsible for nearly percent greenhouse gasses car intensive areas the united states something simple not driving often cutting back totally can help you and others bogota the capital colombia has been the third straight year day without cars day without cars one day that all colombians hike bike skate walk took public tranportation get work the goal day without cars promote alternative transportation and reduce fines citizen talking part the action stated good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution now america has been recorded that americans are buying fewer cars and getting less licences each year the number miles driven the united states peaked and have been slowly and steadily dropping after transportation the second largest source emissions but you can help lower that more and more people have been choosing alternative transportation than ever before also more people have left the sub urban enviroment and moved urban ones alternative transportation even more needed than before also whats the point driving you live near the place you work cutting down emissions one the most important objectives right now many great things can and have come cutting down private transportation conserves resources cuts down emissions and also improves safety multiple people say that commuting less has made thier lives less stressful than ever before the amount smog cities have decreased helping get cleaner natural air those compact areas anything you can help make your lives easier you should and cutting down emissions can help make that easier,3

the challenge exploring venus the author gives suggestions why studying venus worthy pursuit because the little details how venus carries great amount how scientists can study bring actual life that planet however along comes some safety hazards like extreme temperatures and high gasses the atmosphere can see why might venus similar earth venus often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too having planet that similar living planet why wouldn everything our power make planet that very much the same ours science has been evolving lot over the years and pretty sure that with all the technology and theories scientist have came with them being able have study plan out how bring life venus would probably work and greater and more things could also come along with the author does good job these statements because they give some examples both sides why why not there should study life venus the author seem have thrown few claims create arguement for both sides its good idea not have two examples why sending scientist off space would bad idea spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down venus more than three decades having that said send them off into venus would problem because they would have any time experiment and research there since theres been problems with the spaceship not being able survive the planets surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmosphere pressure times greater than waht experience our own planet the material they use would have the problem why the spaceship doesnt seem last long the other hand also agree having this study happen and here why there research from the past that from long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various from life just like earth there other features that venus similar earth the planet has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long time frames space travel addition nasa has came with idea how send the scientists that are willing study for life venus nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray conclusion these were claims how the author stated that the study life venus should should not happen,3
good morning the topic today lesson would how the author support the idea studying venus worthy pursuit despite the danger exploring venus however will find examples support our claim using derails from the text lastly will discover more about venus the author support the idea studying venus worthy pursuit despite the danger exploring venus stating how astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely coved with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth the planet has rocky sediment surface that includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters furthermore recall that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary vitit crucial consideration given the long time frame space travel however states how another project looking jacinto technology called mechanical computers wasnt great the beginning but year went the develop new technology which give people the chance out space explore the planets lastly can support claim say that the title the challenge exploring venus are least because have better equipment the would give better chance not getting hurt stuck the planet the author support the idea studying venus worthy pursuit despite the danger exploring venus stating that with better tools that can help the rocket take all the pressure heat and other forces that comes with going outta space adn all this comes play wiht having better excrement with less deaths and other causes that could happen while taking that journey,2

people not need cars that can drive themselves people were drive car that has the capability drive itself that same car got accident then taht would mean that the driver releasing more the car that would also mean that the diver not paying attention the most important thing when driving the road driving laws focus people safety when people around them are driving and give justice those who need but how can people that when other would not know who blame the driver the manufacturer that car traffic law was something long ago and was invented for human purposes majority people are always careless when driving those drivers think that driving game and those people don release their mistake until they have pay the price for the actions those people and for the security and safety other law where made specifically driving laws most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe result most states illegal even test computer driven cars the author the article even implies about cars not driving themselves being concern and even threat others when people make laws they not just for fun most states that value their citizens make laws harsh they may keep people safe something everyone mostly people who are parents want for their kids parents may not very happy see many even few drivers distracted because they have car that drives itself thay would mostly see threat for their family safety laws change all the time but just because they change does not mean always for the best cause that everything will turn out people were hoping they would still even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover the driver the manufacturer this detail the author implying that they could change the laws many time peoplecom the question people should asking that will that change anything the way people would rely the car will the laws decrease the numbers careless drivers and the amount accidents cause those careless drivers driving laws would much harder control with all those thing hand for example person that had car that could drive itself which cause the driver not pay attention the road then the car would start malfunction and cause huge accident which cause life another who would fault and the careless driver the mechanic the car that malfunction many television show and movies have invision the future with car that can drive and other maxing stuff those are pretty cool stuff television and movies have long fascinated with cars that could drive themselves now that something wish for right wrong you are fascinated with car that could drive themselves that okay but have they stop and look the negative side this automakers are car capable driving autopilot percent the time would sane peron really rely that percent when there percent chance that something could wrong person values their life when comes surgery which could save their life wouldn reasonable that person would think twice about putting risk themselves and even there family when that percent chance not living conclusion people should have fun with things that engineers bring though just because fun and many peopled and look the consequences that could cause does not mean anyone should rely remember that when person see positive that peros who ever may must look the negatives and see really worth everything percent really capable car driving itself are traffic laws really going stop all people and would changing the laws really protect others that are careful and value their lifes that would the audience,4
does the electoral college work the electoral college process which happens the electoral college not place the founding fathers established the constitution compromise between election the president the electors are people who vote for president and vice president and how many votes each one has gotten the priority the electoral college that consist having electors electoral votes required elect for the new president has have the same amount entitled allotment electors the same amount its congressional each candidate running for president your state has his her own group electors but are state laws vary how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are americans all get new president every four years and its always held the tuesday after the first monday november when you are voting for your president you voting for your candidate electors but most staes just have winner take all system that awards all electors the new winning president candidate most people may not like who are next president gon na but all just have deal with because all cant back and pick who wont president all depends how many votes person gets some may get only one vote and others will get millions vote all depends they think your good enough rule your your county very hard for you make decision that big after the presidental election your governor prepares certificate ascertainment listing all the candidates who ran for president your state along with the names their respective electors your state certificates ascertainment are sent the congress and the national archives part the official records the presidental election the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong what have richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce and the afl cio all their time agreed that would abolishing the electoral college gore thanks the quirks the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency more than percent voters would prefer direct election the electoral college still has its defenders you are under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president sometimes stae conventions sometimes the state party central committee sometimes the presidental candidates themsleves the single best argument against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor what state send two slates electors congress has happened before hawaii luckily vice president richard nixon was there but made sure without establishing precedent the house selection can hardly expected reflect the will people shift just votes would have deadlocked the election tie would have occurred mere voters ohio and voters hawaii had voted the other way the election only just wright there during the campaign seventeen staes didnt see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didnt get see single campaign finally done the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational its har dto say but dole was right all along,1
dear senator strongly believe that should demolish the electoral college system highly unfair and can cause the wrong person win the system also has and will continue cause controversy and rightfully begin with the electoral college system extremely unfair with this system play fairly easy for the wrong canidate elected has happened before where the person with the most popular votes meaning they had the majority rule has lost because the way the opposing system run this occasion may occur from time time because when voting you are voting for the electors not the actual president that you want win the system very faulty and there guarantee that the electors will vote for whom they are saying they will continue the system has caused and will continue cause great amounts controversy some people may refer undemocratic outdated even irrational even though all people may not agree with there are reasons still action highly unlikely for there tie the swing states play huge role being the deciding factor who wins and allows all states equal the amount electoral votes they put ratio the population the states there are some good things about the electoral college but some will surely argue that they are not enough otway the bad maybe should just get rid the college and take the easy way out using majority rule really does make the most sense lastly the system makes some people feel their votes are worthless states such texas that made mostly republicans the democrats not feel necessary vote because the system most the people are republican then the democrats already know that the opposite side will get the most electoral votes therefore pointless for them vote another state which this occurs california where the majority people are democratic therefore the republicans dont feel the need vote opinion everyone vote matters should run the elections that way conclude the electoral college should done away with makes people feel like their opinions the matter who runs this country dont actually matter highly faulty meaning the candidate with the most votes does not always win and lastly the system causes loads controversy and will continue until the problem solved,4
according the article driverless cars are coming the near future there will cars that don need driven people but will engineered drive themselves evidence from the article shows there are both positives and negatives these cars being released and used the public people opinion that the development these cars should stop and that they will overall have negative impact the public and cause much more trouble than they are worth the first major concern mine the legality these cars the article states that computer driven cars are illegal test most states person definitely couldn ride one public only the states california nevada florida and the district columbia are allowed even limited use semi autonomous cars order for these cars even released the public many states would have change their laws and would take long period time just that there also cameras placed some the driverless cars and that complete invasion privacy believe person should able whatever they want their own car without having worry about being watched another down side computer driven cars liability issues car were get into accident would the driver the one blame would the manufacturer the car there man made object that fool proof why would computer driven cars any different these are only some the questions that people will face companies release driverless cars the public firm believer than machines operated people work much more efficiently than machines that operate themselves believe that cars are something that are meant driven people and they try operate themselves many accidents and machine malfunctions will occur there already many malfunctions that occur modern cars also driving meant awesome experience for people new driving and driver less cars are developed future generations will robbed their chance experience what driving really like opinion that the development these cars should stop for multiple reasons and that they will overall have negative impact the public and cause much more trouble than they are worth the development these cars should stop because great amount money and time being put into something that believe will negatively impact the public the issues stated above are only some the issues that people will have face driverless cars are released the public think how many more issues could possibly arise from computer driven cars being released the public,4
dear senator believe that the united states should switch the precedential election process popular vote this due the fact that the has grown and people need vote for who believe great and capable leader for our country and can let other people vote for think that the original thought behind the electoral college compromise was good its time but now longer the time for compromise even the electoral college has some right ideas such helping choose the correct leader believe obvious see will fail and make mistakes result choosing our own leaders however more important and more beneficial that make our own mistakes need learn from them ourselves rather than stopped and pointed into direction before getting the chance decide which path take like said before the big boy time take the training wheels off support idea that america should run off popular vote shall point out some flaws with the idea the electoral college the electoral college isn equal there are unequal amount people per state and even though divide power amongst those representatives equally there still isnt equal say among them individuals meaning group representatives from one state and one representative from another state could have the same power how that equal only the sense that each state itself has the same amount play the election but they don some states actually get looked over everytime the election happens another problem that the representatives don represent each person the state what they yearn for their leader just the state itself top the fact that the people aren properly represented right the people who are actually voting can just vote for who they like which points the fact that the electoral college has the possibility immoral and completely wrong nation that run the people should run the people was said that house divided can not stand now the subject that this moute pertains different than that the one using but still true the government should was intended run the people create better and greater tomorrow the people deserve the popular vote sincerely proper name,3
the article making mona lisa smile are talking about how professor thomas huang just came out with the facial action coding system supposed able detect exactly how other people are feeling even they are trying hide their emotions can still know how people are feeling the latest innovation the beckman institute for advanced science the university illinois was working collaboration with professor nicu seve the university amsterdam all for the value using this technology read students emotional expressions all does beginning with the computer construction computer model the face all major muscles the model must move like human muscles then huang relies the work psychologists such paul eckman who the creator the facial action coding system has classified six basic emotions happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness then associated each with characteristic movements the facial muscles when you raise your eyebrows you are surprised and when you tighten your lips you show anger this will really help show how different people are feeling they are doing something for school such lesson computer and the way being done making them bored tired then will able tell and can change the way the lesson being taught that they will become more interested you raise your lips the corners your mouth then squint your eyes slightly produce wrinkling the corners your eyes holding that raise the outer parts your cheeks toward your eyes the emotion that you are doing that your face looks happy have this then will able feel someone else emotional state because wer unconsciously imitate another person facial expressions conclusion huang made the facial action coding system can help tell how others are feeling and tell they are trying hide their emotions can help when get bored when are our computers doing things for school can help make things more interesting that don fall asleep stop doing what need can also help feel someone else emotional state because unconsciously imitate another person facial expressions,2
the article the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the author explains why throughout the article and tries persuade readers into thinking that venus planet should not give but the question still remains why are scientist still researching this planet dangerous paragraph one the author explains that venus one the brightest points light the night sky this may bring interest astronomers and stargazers that enjoy studying and watching the sky night this may worthy cause for some people continue studying venus paragraph two the author explains how venus sometimes referred earth twin venus almost the same size and density earth and also close distance some people may find this interesting because people earth are always looking for other forms life and other places besides earth venus like earth physical and other ways there may life venus that haven discovered yet one the most important things know that venus once could have been the most earth like planet the entire solar system believe that this information very important and more people should keep studying that paragraph four says that venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth held life back then why wouldn now venus was once like earth why couldn earth like venus now some people may worry that earth will turn out like venus with high temperatures and crazy atmospheric pressures scientists and astronomers find more information about this planet could have almost every answer need for all our questions traveling venus very difficult and dangerous process the article the author states that nasa the national aeronautics and space administration has idea for sending people from earth study the planet venus they are trying create vehicle that hovers the planet instead going directly the surface venus nasa also working different methods studying venus besides the hovering vehicles they made some simplified electronics made silicon carbide and they have been tested lab they are able find way venus they will able find out much more information about they also went back and are trying old techology called mechanical computers the mechanical computers were used the during world war believe that using old technology may good thing for some people and positive thing look some people look technology nowadays and believe bad thing but are using older technology from different generation people might think different also stated the article modern technology very quick and efficient but not come much use extreme conditions for example you put modern day cellphone laptop very hot condition will most likely melt because the material used make used older technology the technology would made different materials and could come more handy think this may another reason keep exploring venus because you could create much technology and invent ways venus successfully you could also find new ways explore other planets and other planets creating this technology would lead many great discoveries about our planets and our solar system paragraph mentions that they could build mechanical parts that can more resistant pressure heat and other forces these parts made there may benefit the scientists and every day people these products can made around the world and can benefit everyday society opinion believe that going venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents you could find out many new things see new things and learn new things think that scientists and astronauts have good idea how and think they will eventually venus one day least figure out lot about people earth should take risks and able expand their knowledge about the world and about the other planets the solar system besides earth,4

the electoral college gives certain states based their popularity number how many what guess can called points that will the candidate that gets the most votes for themself out that state now whether that good idea not completely based your own option which you can decide but disagree with the electoral college even though did take while thinking came the conclusion that all out popular vote more efficient when comes voting for president than the electoral college and there three main reasons that swung side with popular vote first all when you get right down the electoral college just doesnt give perfect accuracy who does actually get the exact most votes some people cant completely grasp this fact but imagine that there florida alaska and montana the first candidate which shall call john and the second bill are going for these three states john beats bill florida and john gets all electoral votes because that tough luck for bill luckily for bill sweeps over john alaska and montana and gets points from each state which gives him points total now popular vote bill would win with votes against john but since bill only has electoral points because still lost florida which was the state john won and got whopping points from bill will lose his campaign john because thats what the amazing wonders the electoral college are which basically sums how gore lost bill gates even that gore had more overall votes the electoral college also makes candidates have strategically plan out their campaign they can focus big states and swing states only candidate knows will not win certain state wont even focus because would pointless even changes maybe couple thousand voters minds wont get him single point loses that state whereas with popular vote changing the mind people that you get yourself from having california overall votes for you means more votes than literally all alaska eligible voting population that drives candidates away from states they wont win and they states known swing states that dont have specific party that they vote for every election and they will attempt win these states votes the most because those points will make the biggest difference the final thing like touch that the electoral college system takes many peoples idea and erases want our vote mean something throughout the whole campaign but doesnt matter you are one the few democrat supporters overall republican dominated state because when your state loses poof there goes your vote floating off into oblivion because doesnt matter now your one vote doesnt stand chance against going against according the electoral college want our vote count for the candidate himself not part some majorly flawed point system that someone thought would help somehow when picking the right candidate become the head honcho sitting charge the white house our country and the overall leader our military forces too need our vote heard and for actually count even more people disagree with the same state those votes should actually count towards something instead being overrun and erased the which will earn some candidate couple points for their campaign now after all this not only has own opinion strongly changed favor popular vote but hope yours has too electoral college just doesnt provide that actual perfect accuracy who wins that popular does forces presidents only visit and campaign certain states that they have chance winning and takes citizens votes and throws them down the drain more people the same state vote differently just makes you sit and wonder whos idea was accept this system,5
somethings are difficult explain because you can never sure there scientific explanations for different things already but some are harder explain there picture that was taken nasa spacecraft viking that shows shadowy likeness human face the red planet known mars there has been many discussions what could some believe was created alien life and others think natural landform there has been different date collected supported these claims scientist nasa that has been researching this topic and believe natural landform when people don have explanation for something they beginning make things when came this picture they assumed aliens since mars difficult think otherwise also many things like the internet and magazines wanted publicity they changed the story more interesting and give the people what they wanted can see why they would think that because there really wasn much explain what really was the face mars was something people couldn explain right way before being sure what was since was space things like meteoroids could have been part forming the face people tend make conclusions quick and not think through very well the face mars was talked about alot and quite breathtaking the picture they captured face just natural landform when people sat the jet propulsion lab and they saw the image was just formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth was natural formed over the years many things have occured that have changed many things that occur the world around technology advanced that are able send satelites into space help and see what else out there they send spacecrafts and rovers into space mars and the moon just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh april mars global surveyor flew over cydonia and saw more clear pictures the face mars they saw and showed alien monumentum there were signs that could have been created aliens the year they captured even better picture that allowed them fully see the face and collected more data what the picture actually showed was the martian equivalent landform common around the american west scientist nasa say looks similar the middle butte the snake river plain idaho that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars that proved once agan that natural landform there could many explanations what formed there always going thing can explain control but with new technology and advancements our world more those unexplainable things won are the new generations and can accomplish much are always going discovering new things and have new things explain there much more beyond this plante and all the other ones things out outerspace may reman mystery for quite some time but not forever are close making breakthrough who knows what lays ahead the future but can wait find out,5

living community where less and less people are using cars would good for several reasons one reason that there wil far less pollution the city and nearby areas another advantage that the town will much quitter and noise pollution will down the best would probably that there would far less accidents living city with little cars seems better then living city filled with cars noise and gas pollution major problem that cars and other vehicles create living car free city would much cleaner and would result there being less smog and noxious gases the atmosphere alot the world pollution comes from cars not driving them some places around the world could cut down carbondioxide and other gas emmissions alot and with the absence cars pople would not annoyed the sounds like they would cars were used the community and people would able sleep better get more work done even the greatest advantage off all that the death rate from car accidents would down dramatically the population may even because this and bring more money for the city there would also alot less fear when crossing tighe street and most places the city are easily within walking biking distance and then cars would become useless since the streets cities and towns are often contested due the overwhelming mass cars but everyone biked walked would much safer and calmer and the streets would far less backed conclusion using bikes your feet transportation far better and just not even more effective the using vehicles like cars using the vehicle method has far more advantages then disadvantages,3

the author suggests that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents the challenge exploring venus provides lot information about venus the author also provides ways could get people venus without getting them injured the author wants study venus because basically the earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size also occasionally the closest distance not always the closest because mars and venus moves different speeds one might closer than the other another reason why the author wants study venus because not one spacecraft has touched down venus more than three decades thats because the spacecrafts can not handle the temperature venus temperature average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience earth those conditions would liquefy many metals the author provided facts from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa one there ideas get people venus study there idea was create vehicle that can hover miles above the venusian landscape the conditions would not harsh the temperature would only around degrees fahrenheit and the air pressure would close sea level earth those condition are much easier for human survive the three reason stated are why the author thinks that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents they could create vehicle that could avoid touching the surface that also helps with the temperatures humans can survive while studying,3
you ever think that exploring planet far from home worth astronauts take the challenge travel venus and explore the mysteries the planet the author supports the idea taking the challenge venus stating that the planet worth studying for regardless what dangers pursue them most astronauts from nasa are fascinated about the idea the exploration venus article says astronomers are fascinated venus because way well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth addition also says some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for three weeks such conditions there are lot astronauts nasa that are willing take the challenge venus and nasa has already been simulating prototypes withstand the conditions similar venus the planet not just fascinating also really dangerous for astronauts travel there exploring venus really dangerous that one will able survive with such harsh conditions the astronauts have face the text says even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet addition the article also states venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer our sun the conditions that planet venus are much worse than earth the planet contains such heat that over degrees fahrenheit for conclusion there are lot dangers and obstacles that the astronauts need prepare for the astronauts want accomplish the challenge explore venus the author supports the idea taking the challenge venus stating that the planet worth studying for regardless what dangereuses them,4
this natural land form and here tell you why its landform becasue april when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camera moc team snapped picture ten time sharper than the original viking photo after revealing natural landform there was alien monument after all another reason why know just land form because when nasa actually gets seond look the picture actually shows equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west garvin said reminded him from the middle butte the snake river plain idaho the shadows gave the the illusion the eyes nose and mouth wasnt really facial features just was the shadows making seem like conclusion thats why know its not face those couple reasons and would have not been able showing that clearly unless that incident happened recently,2

there can many advantages and disadvantages having car but the advantages not having card greatly outweighs having one there can many reasons why not having car great but the main three are reduces pollution reduces stress and having less cars reduces the notice pollution city can you imagine place with cars first off the main advantage limiting car use less pollution cars account for gas emissions europe and america without cars the air would much cleaner and the smog would gone over the cities london had much smog over the city that they had cut car use half with all their citizens after only five days most the smog was gone and people could back driving imagine had everclear the world stopped driving could get rid most the smog less than one week another great point how limiting car use can help will reduce the stress grantly peoples lives the first source man from vauban germany said when had car was always tense much happier this way also another man from columbia said during day without cars its good opportunity take away stress most stress comes from rodange getting stuck major traffic jam imagine how starless people will without cars finaly reducing car use will gravely reduce the notice pollution everywhere when you out side whats the first thing you hear people children all you can hear the engine cars everywhere city where they banned most cars the sound children drown out the occasional car engine not the other way around can you imagine how peacefully that would not waking the sound cars conclusion having car can have its advantages but limiting there use would far better for people would help stop air pollution reduce stress and reduce notice pollution cities and suburbs having car really worth,4
the picture faces mars are actually natural landforms known buttes mesas the text states that the picture really shows martian version butte mesa the text also states that you can find other mesas around the american west mesas are pieces land that above ground level the author also stated that garvin mission controller said that reminded him most middle butte the snake river plain idaho and that its lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same hight the face mars although can see why people would think was created aliens there are more facts prove that its natural landform scientists have shown that right now there are signs life mars aliens could not have made conclusion science has proved many more facts about the face than conspiracy theorist has,3
cars are big influence our worlds society everyone wants able drive and many people drive but good driving seems there are also many negative things that occur when driving car but the affects limited driving can potentially have positive impact our lives and our enviroment our world large number people drive cars get work school and many other places due people driving there have been several negative effects our planet due people driving from place place there are very high pollution levels our atmosphere from the exhaust that the car lives off for example europe cars are responsible for twelve percent greenhouse gas emissions and the united states fifty percent green house gas emissions this can potentially damage our enviroment and hurt our planet but not all this has negative many countries have been setting days even banding cars general decrease levels pollution and promote limited car use positive thing this attempt help clean our enviroment the positive side were stop using passenger cars for transporation our enviroment would alot cleaner more suitable live stop driving and even owning cars could potentially have impact our personal lifes and make more relaxed and feel happier for example women the name heidrun walter said when had car was always tense much happier this way many countries are currently making serious effort stop the use cars all some countries have completely wiped out the usage cars and have gone riding bikes walking and even taking the bus these efforts can only have positive effect our enviroment every country tries enforce the fact that cars are damaging our enviroment then potentially the pollution levels and the smog levels will begin decrease and maybe even deplete passenger cars the world bigger issue then everyone thinks but everyone pitches the idea that cars equals better society then believe that passenger cars will soon gone for good passangers cars the world are coming end and our enviroment going healthier than ever,3
against driverless cars because paragraph and says the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel fact none the cars developed far are completely driverless they can steer accelerate the brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents this means the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires therefore the cars are not driverless you have still were and take controle around work zones accidents driverless cars are supposed driverless meaning driver needed also another thing the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over why does driverless car need driver does the place that made them not know how make what the car called true why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver could ask everyone the same question you really want driverless car that still needs driver sure one would even driverless they read about they will find out not completely driverless why get something that false advertised,2

technology develops more need consider what valuable and what should left behind the facial action coding system would beneficial read students emotional expressions being able adjust identify how student feeling might prove invaluable boredom very common feeling school disengages students stopping them from participating and paying attention all together according the article classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor technology continues play more prominent role education this technology could help every student learn and stay interested identifying what the student feeling could make crucial adjustments the learning plan and the students would better off for this technology could valuable for students non academic way teachers being able understand what student feeling could life saving people experience problems different kinds every single day paragraph seven the article states they even indicate the difference between genuine smile and forced one teacher identifying that there problem with student would allow them talk with that student who might going through hard time there life and provide some relief student who might feel burdened stressed this technology would very valuable the classroom being able adjust lesson plan could help students stay engaged and understand the material better identifying sadness any other negative emotion could help with any problems someone might experiencing home the facial action coding system would beneficial students mental health and overall well being,4
driverless cars are coming everything our society based science and technology cars are also developing from human control driverless the article the left introduces how big companies for instance google bmw etc are trying make driverless cars come into our daily life and how the law will change have driverless cars commonly once driverless cars come into our life people will argue that good develop driverless cars bad opinion have positive aspects driverless cars the first and the most direct reason because driverless cars can make our daily life much more convenient than before don need worry about which road are driving any places haven been before the car will drive for will have plan for which road direction the second reason the driverless cars are safer than people driving themselves sometimes people can not drive safely when they are tired get drunk that can make huge accident but the driverless cars can help drive the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone passage using the sensor the car don need worry about safety anymore the sensor can control the car and give much safer trip than ever before the third reason driverless cars can reduce the quantity accidents when people are using the driverless cars they must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires this necessitates the car being ready quickly get the driver attention whenever problem occurs passage although driverless car drivers still need pay attention convenience safety reduction accidents these are the reasons choose use the driverless cars there huge number people who still have negative aspects the driverless cars technologies need improve can improve our phones our computers but why not cars the driverless cars the symbol the improvement technologies and driverless cars can bring lot benefits our life can get more convenient and safer than before,4

the voting system very interesting thing the electoral college good system that represents the population the united states the electoral college takes into consideration how big the state based the population the state how many house representatives the more house representatives the state has the more impact will have the precedential election due population when you think about the precedential election and where the people that are mostly the united states the electoral college great system because takes into consideration where most the population there also some wrong with the electoral college does have problems most things the single best arguement against the electoral what some people call the disaster factor the disaster factor that the state legislators are responsible for picking electors and electors can always defy the will the people for example segregationists the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john kennedy therefor popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone kennedy solem electors have also occasionally refused vote for their party canidate and cast their deciding vote for whoever they want the worst possible thing with the electoral college the prospect tie the electoral vote this case the election would thrown the house representatives many people not like the electoral college the popular vote probably the most logical and most simple way have the precedential election think the popular vote shows which president the people the united states actually want the popular vote voting system simply counts all the votes and see which president wins very simple process however the popular vote means nothing the electoral college vote president wins the popular vote but gets beaten the electoral college vote the president who won the electoral college vote wins because that just how both these voting systems are very interesting think the popular votes barely beats out the electoral college vote for the popular vote just seems more accurate and more simple you should change the voting system the popular vote for more accuracy the popular vote better and will make the united states voting policies better,3
facial action coding system think good idea because someone trying figure out how you are feeling and you don tell them they can look the computer and tell what your emotions are the passage tells that the computer and has major muscle this tell that friend feeling way you can tell and you would actually know fitts true and not false paragraph one explains that there are six basic emotions and they are happiness surprise anger and ect for example your frontalis muscle above your eye raises your eyebrows when you are surprise some people wouldnt think that this possible but think its something good when student looking the computer they can pick all emotions like you have mixed emotions just one sometimes teachers want know how they students are feeling but just don want walk the and just ask this computer think was wonderful thing that someone can make ever had this computer would very useful because want know how others feel some people who try just look someone and tell how they are feelings not always helpful they might think its one thing but its another most people are not just good going off someone look but this computer can help out alot you don need try and guess what that person feeling evan when some artist are trying draw persons emotion they don always know either they would also need the computer huang says story that vinci has and computer when draw that could get the specific facial expression was get one these computes would like use everyone around because love see people happy and they are not would like make there day taking test and get confused know that the computers see that and the teacher would know and try help out little using these can help everyone out many different ways everyone should have one these get computer lie this one you really need know about someone you just would look see what this would good when school have play and the people that are watching them need want figure out how the characters feel,3
people have been debating the use new technology should used the classroom however people have yet decide there are two sides this augment the pro side the people who want the use new technology and then there are them who think newer technology not needed learn these people are the con side the author nick alto made great points how new facal technology could helpful the classroom the first way new facal technology could help the classroom showing when student confused and not sure whats going paragraph huang states classroom computer can recognize when student becoming confused cored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor for example this when doing math homework online english the computer could recognize when the student confused and then send the student step step instruction also the teacher could request this infomation which problem the students are confused and over them into more detailed the second reason why should use facial technology for students who are interested into coding and computer animations students can learn how make video games characters more expressive paragraph the same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games video surgery this could help when student taking and computer animation class and very interested into becoming coder when making these games the more detail and expression the animators can put into these games the more infomation they need this program can help provide that kind knowlege the other hand yes this new facial technology not necessary people often say teacher can read their students facial expressions just fine without technology however teacher might just over look not able tell what the student feeling this new facial technology can track facial movements and identify mixed emotions the teacher could also access this and use help their students for the better should schools allow new facial technology classrooms that what has been dicussed passed years they allow them classrooms could help students when they use work online when the computer detects student confused having trouble they could send out helpful work when student interested computer animation the computer could have facial expressions and detailed know how make these possible the computer schools should allow these their classrooms not only for students but for teachers also,4
