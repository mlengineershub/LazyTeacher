have you ever thought having car that could drive itself would pretty cool car have but there are some things you have think about when you consider buying car course the car going expansive but what car isnt there are alot more negative things you have think about when buying smart car negative aspects driverless are that they are expensive need many sensors and they result many accidents driverless car very expansive because they have know the roads when stop how stop when stated these smart road systems worked surprisingly well but they required massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply too expensive practical driverless cars work well but they are too expensive because they have know the upgrades roads imagine the cost you have pay for the car giving them their money back for the money they spent and work they spent putting into the car sensors are very big issues too driverless cars driverless cars require many sensors order for the car work and drive its own seems cool but what will happen when one those sensors stopped working and you didnt know the sensors were placed every where the car therefore can work properly google modified toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor there lot sensors installed inside the car but something can very wrong one them stop working and the car crashes and injure somebody who fault would someone injured because techonology failure driverless car are not reliable due safety concerns manufactures believe that more states will follow soon the cars are proved more reliably safe the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer someone hurt because the technology the car you really can say who blame although the driver can take control the car any time therefore the driver can fault because the driver wasn paying attention the road the driverless car supposed make the driver aware danger but couldn have there was accident the car can fault one really knows who blame because both the car and the driver took responsible the accident and they both could have prevented the accident from happening the car would have alerted the driver the driver could have took control but the driver eas paying attention could have once again took control there are positive and negative aspects when comes driverless cars but course one pays attention the negative when thinking about purchasing driverless car you have think about the cost and your safety concerns driverless cars are very expensive because the sensors that are installed and the upgrades road they are dangerous becuase due technology failure they can result into car accidents expense sensors and accidents are negative aspect driverless ares,634,0.0078864353312302,4

both sides have good arguments when comes the development driverless cars one side technology making enough these cars and these cars may cause more traffic problems the other side this could end pollution know however know that certain things are inevitable and pollution one those therefore going vote against driverless car development most reasons towards the overall safety according the passage most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety best achieved with alert drivers alert driving prevents car crashes time the hospital and the biggest them all lawsuits with these driverless cars how can prevent something bad happening for example say you sitting your driverless car and you the middle traffic jam the car overloads and begins automatically pick speed despite your attempts stop the car your going mph traffic jam all sudden you crash into building and injure yourself not mention four passengers and three pedestrians not only does this put your hospital bill little bit out your price range but you have pay for damages and lawsuits think about how many deaths injuries that would cause also costs lot put these driverless cars together the whole world could bankrupt putting least these cars the road not like american that rich according the passage google attempted make driverless cars however was proved that those cars were not completely driverless due the fact that still alerts the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues such navigating through roadwork accidents opinion google made yet another smart car though movies and video games contemplate the idea cars that drive themselves cars reality might not happen conclusion driverless cars will problem unless the technology for this car develops which probably will the future newsflash cars that can drive themselves are not real well they not real yet that for the future decide anyways that why against the devlopment these driverless cars,483,0.0,4

driverless cars are not good idea and not for them driverless cars are very expensive begin with upgrades public roads need done for the smarter cars driven the massive upgrades the roads will also cost too much money self driven cars still not meet all safety measures that why illegal drive the road with them most states none the cars developed far are completely driverless they can steer accelerate and brake themselves they all require the driver drive throught work zones and around accidents why shouldn the driver just drive all the time you have drive through little things like work zones driving doesn require much skill besides being aware your surroundings what else you have car the road driving should basic human skill for all people the world today almost all driving laws help secure the drivers passengers and pedestrians safe keeping these laws are best achieved with alert human drivers you never know when the computer the car will malfunction when the devices will just suddenly stop working the technology fails the blame goes the manufacturers there will most likely lot court cases that the car companies will have deal with the cars malfunction the self driving cars will cost lot less money gas nearly percent gas will saved but the money that you save gas doesnt make for how much the car will cost how much the upgraded roads will and the risk you are taking letting computer drive you around wherever you want even when you have some the driving yourself the cost the gas does not make for how much everything else will cost not for driver less cars most the self driving cars will come down two things money and safety will cost much money for everything with the cars besides gas there still isn enough safety being provided the vehicles the upgrades that need done you dont know they will safe and you know the cost them will really high not for driver less cars,448,0.0044642857142857,4
the idea driverless cars would really cool but the same time would pretty reckless anything can happen the car you could have accident and could lead death but the same time would cool not have drive your own you would have more time multi task the car first reason the whole idea growing getting job and learning how drive teenager you want learn how drive you can have more freedom where you want and when you want with driverless cars you won able have that experience majority believe teens want learn how something their own like learning how drive teenagers want places without always having their parents drop them pick them from places they want freedom but with freedom comes responsibility which really important for teen parents parent wants their teen obtain responsibility for their actions for example teen learning how drive and his father teaching him how that teen will learn how follow instructions which can help him school and later life another example lets say teen has already gotten his her drivers license and now can drive his own account this teen can help around the house and grocery shopping when his parents are too busy out this teaches teenagers responsibility that they need know later lastly one knows for fact that these driverless cars can really work yes you can test them and they might work that place time but that doesn always guarantee that won happen ever somebody can driving and perhaps the car doesn respond time and crashes into another car you can get into serious accidents and who blame for that would your fault would the companies fault there really isn way know conclusion believe that driverless cars would not such great idea because anything can happen and you never know there could accidents deaths someone learning how drive may not have the experience learning how driverless cars would cool but can also pretty lazy you can get lazy and distracted easily and not concentrate the road ahead you will just have wait and see will have driverless cars,488,0.0,4

agree that changing election popular vote for the president the united states would better choice than continue electoral college you may ask yourself why well not fair have pick random person something you should the one doing like saying you pick your neighbor clean your house your house still being cleaned but not you instead random person you don even know thus continuing electoral college the same because this case the elector you pick and don even know going make choices that the end the day you might not even agree and you can nothing about that point during electoral college voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate this means there too many names the list that you most likely have never even heard your life therefore leading you voting for the wrong candidate some electors aren even faithful instead going for their party candidate they rather decide voting for whomever they please most likely leading alot conflict because the candidate not even their party and the voters would hate have follow someone else rules yet again can nothing about voters would always love control whom their electors vote for but this will never happen with electoral college the whole point for the electoral college that the people voting for the electors won have any power against anything that the government continues have power over the people that can great some point but sooner later will cause confict because some people don always agree with what the government has say therefore changing election popular vote for president would much better than continue electoral college the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong states that during the campaign seventeen states didn see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didn get see single campaign now right there perfect example electors being unfair electors want people keep voting for them that they can pick the candidates yet they always skip the part showing who the candidates are there why people will randomly guess how their candidates will end being they never even hear few words from them conclusion strongly believe changing election popular vote for president wiser decision than continue electoral college because fair the people who are voting people will start get together try and get know the candidate and most likely agree more the idea than anything else mean while electoral college very unfair system because they have idea who the elector going pick candidate and they pick someone who they don even know the end the day they will stuck with total stranger,623,0.0032102728731942,4

think driverless cars are not yusufu right now and that they should not let people drive driverless car the streets because person still needs the car and must remain alert case needs take control the car driverless cars are not safe and will cause lot confusion case accident driverless cars are useless because person needs car and must remain alert case needs take control the car the text says this means the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires this does not make huge difference between that and driving also people would very uncomfortable and insecure about what could happen once watched video about peron testing the autopilot mode tesla and most the time was insecure putting his hands the wheel case something happens they should not let people use driverless cars the streets becuase they are not safe driverless cars are safe unreal sitios and places without other cars the text says they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents this makes the car not safe also the car knows the streets and the buildings but does not know about others cars people that can intercept the car and that would not give enough time for the car react driverless cars are useless and they should not let poeple use them the streets because there would lot confusion case accident the text says the technology fails and someone inured who fault the driver the manufacturer the laws are not ready for driverless cars and case accident would depend lot factors find out who was the responsable the accident sum driverless cars could very useful technology but they have improve lot more driven the streets,418,0.0119617224880382,3

the electoral college has been used for years agree that must keep this way yes possible that the outcome the popular vote that the people have chosen not agreement but has been the best way selecting president highly unlikely that when the people vote for certain selection the candidates group electors will change their mind has happened before but rare suggest that the electoral college stay and not change the election because has not only been used for years but also some the citizens may make mistake who they vote for and atleast with the electoral college can make sure have the right president each candidate has their own electors and take electoral votes choose president and since they are from the same group they wouldn choose someone else has happened says the excerpt this system has been used for years why change now the electoral college has worked this way for years the founding fathers came with good process completely fair all the people get select their candidate and the electors know what their responsibilities are the citizens aren completely able control the electors ideas but they might have bit more knowledge the subject some citizens may get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate excerpt from passage this refers the fact that may have chaos let the people decide directly who our president need insider review our peoples choices and make sure that the correct one and what better way than have the electoral college depends the state and the candidate political party which you chose the people will get what they asked for their has been times which that not always the case but the electors usually make the decision the people has asked for said the passage defense the electoral collage each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the party nominee and the trust rarely betrayed this system the best one yet our people are well informed but not always take out the electoral college are leaving our country their hands and people make mistakes sometimes with the electoral college have various people making the right decision like when author writes book they don get published right away they have people make sure their spelling correct and they make many other different corrections the same with the electoral college and the way the president selected state senator suggest keep this system,546,0.0054945054945054,4

our country was built the idea giving people influential chance our government the votes that matter the presidential election should the popular vote the people because the electoral college votes are counted and not the people and the country was formed for the thought equal rights among the people the electoral college made electors who are chosen different ways per state this means the electors are the ones voting and not the people the people vote goes these electoral colleges where the electors choose what candidate they want vote for the person the electors send their vote may not what the people chose the excerpt from the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses are wrong stated that under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president that said the people vote for the electors not the president also stated this excerpt the fact the disaster factor this the possibility that the electors chosen could defy the will the people this county has reputation being one the most free countries the world was founded show each citizen living the same rights more less than another person that said each state should have the right vote for which candidate they choose any kind election this means the vote the people should determine which president elected the fact the electoral colleges goes against this idea each state has own number electoral college votes these votes are set determined one per elector the way the government determines how many electors state has seeing how many members congress the state has the number members the house that the state has plus two for the senators equals how many electoral votes state gets the excerpt from defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president there map the united states continental states and two seperate boxes for alaska and hawaii each state this map has number inside these numbers represent how many electoral college electors the corresponding state gets this proves how unfair the idea electoral college take california for example california has electoral college votes now look states like alaska and montana only three electoral votes are given these states compare the populations between california and wyoming even though there electoral vote difference between these two states not big wyoming people versus california million not only that the electors can choose whatever candidate the running they want and that the problem with the electoral college not all electors will vote for the candidate the citizens want the vote for president isn really the people now the electoral college idea should eliminated because the electors votes are counted and are not biased the people and because the electoral college can described unconstitutional the idea should changed that the people have bigger impact the presidental decision this way america can live reputation,654,0.0015290519877675,3

dear state senator highly unlikely that you will read this but hey worth shot there are many reasons why the electoral college process should used elect the president the united states and many reasons why the popular vote process should used for this same purpose there controversy which process should used had say into which should used and which should not used would rule the favor the popular vote process and not the favor the electoral college process the first reason why would favor the popular vote process that the electoral college process big states are being more effective than small states this might lead the small states not vote because they feel that they would not make difference source claim the following other things being equal large state gets more attention from presidential candidates campaign than small state does when bigger states have more electoral votes the candidates will lead thinking that they get the bigger states for example california who gets electoral votes their favor then they might have bigger chance winning which will have the small states like hawaii who only gets electoral votes thinking that they have say who gets their president this claim supported source when stated knowing their vote will have effect they have less incentive pay attention the campaign than they would have the president were picked popular vote the second reason why not the favor the electoral college process because said source voter toss states are more likely pay close attention the campaign really listen the competing candidates knowing that they are going decide the election candidates mostly pay attention states that have more electoral votes this causes them pay more attention the bigger states and leave out the smaller ones already argued some states get more electoral votes than others another reason why this bad because most states will not pay attention the election because they will not make difference popular vote were action then more people and citizens will pay attention because will more interesting election since more people have say and the candidates will pay attention all states even the bigger states with more electoral votes know that they are the ones basically decide the election the popular vote process more effective and fair for the united states choosing the president most people can argue that favor well you want the elections fair suppose that you will pay attention the voice thousands citizens and you will fair,570,0.0070175438596491,4

the advantages limiting car usage that less gas released thus causing steady more healthier earth limiting cars completely world changing although most people arent favor the cause they dont know the real effects the gas that produced cars around the world the gasses that are released from cars are very hazardous the ozone and can cause environmental changes too much gas released for example paris they had almost near record pollution buildup and since diesel popular france because tax policy that favors diesel over standard gasoline the gas released from diesel was more thicker and hazardous after bunch air pollution built they enforced ban that would stop cars from driving for specific amount time halt the gas buildup you were caught driving when the ban was active you were fined euros american currency dollars and people the declined the fine the authorities impounded their car paris was generous enough allow public transit and would free charge but wasn too easy for the companies budge because they would losing money bogota columbia they have already been taking action this gas problem banning cars for specific amount time but this their third straight year doing this this campaign originated the and was said improve bogota they have constructed miles bicycle paths and have promoted bicycle use business man named carlos arturo said that good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution which entirely true their goal get people use alternate transportation and reduce the smog that the cars created,341,0.0,3

you belive aliens the first reason why say that the face was just natural landforms because there such things aliens for example the text says shadowy likeness human face this example show that likeness isn always certain you have absolutely sure before you start making claims about what the picture showing did you see for yourself did you any research about another reason why the alien story real because one officially approved they only took pictures the face one went down mars examine observe the face example for this would that the passage says only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh this example shows that looks like egyptian pharaoh how would the aliens know about the next reason why the alien myth isnt true because the passage says the word illusion the word illusion means something that you can see but not there for example the tex states that formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth this example shows that illusion may seem real but not real you have make sure that your facts are reliable and your resources are reliable finally why people say that the landform was formed aliens because appeared books magazines and radio talk shows even haunted grocery store for years they don know just because this thing goes public dosen mean true for example some people thim that bona fide evidence the people that think taht bona fide evidence did they any research did they just rely what the social media says conclusion you should believe that the face natural landform because aliens isn real,372,0.0161290322580645,3

studying the planet venus dangerous this article reading called the challenge exploring venus this article mainly mentions about the planet venus conditions and experiences this planet sometimes known the evening star this planet has alot reasons why shouldn studied the temperature conditions planet venus are extremely high also the second planet closest the planet earth and scientist wont even able observe this planet closely start off with the planet venus temperature are extremely high the text mentions the planet surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth this piece evidence with specific details explaining how hot this planet could get this planet times greater than our actually temperature human were able this planet and actually land they wouldn even last atleast seconds that planet secondly planet venus the second more nearest the earth which means venus also most closest the sun venus goes around the earth different speeds that could probably reason why venus has extremely high temperatures the text states each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours this text talks about how they had stop giving missions venus because the nasa realized they couldn much more their partners couldn even survive instead keeping the missions for this planet they had cancel all since they were eventually getting type information but for the weather the last reason was that nasa can even get near the planet because the conditions are terrible they will have experience the planet from specific distance the text states thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans this piece evidence explaining how distance nasa will from the planet even mentions the temperature and how the conditions would hard but helps for humans survive nasa will floating around the earth trying experience any little thing they could possibly get their eyes the can even take samples rocks gas anything else conclusion believe venus couldn get studied reasons are becuase the temperature conditions pretty high the closest the sun and the earth and nasa wouldn even able experience this planet closely these reasons are why believe planet venus shouldn get studied too dangerous,580,0.0206896551724137,4
americans throughout the country believe that the electoral college isn fair and believe that they deserve more direct voting system the president other than voting for electors these reasons are made the people because they want more and more power the government what the people want almost always the risky option especially when the topic government believe that the electoral college should kept the way now and not direct voting system for american citizens said the previous statement americans that want the electoral college gone are lurking for more power when comes rules unfortunately the government decisions were left the hands the people the country state would anarchy the other hand the electoral college offers congress and the senate share the power and the american citizens share the power well for example the electoral college began diminish then became wiped out immediately the government could nothing less but watch the people choose the president that they want sometimes what wanted the people may not always the right thing moving almost percent all american voters stated that they would rather have direct voting system putting aside the electoral college what most people are not seeing that the direct voting and electoral college system are very similar the difference between the two that when americans vote the electoral college they are voting for electors that towards the president and when americans vote directly the president those same amount votes the president well the voting system was based off direct route the presidents side then there would too many votes count which why have representatives towards each state one the glories the electoral college finally the popular voting system very flawed considering that there are states that have millions more people people than others some states even double the size other states according population for example new york population most likely doubles the population florida but thanks the electoral college the representative and population ratio weighs out giving each state equal amount votes toward their president now the popular voting system was place then states like new york would outnumber states like florida votes millions would not fair now the popular voting system replaced the electoral college conclusion the electoral college has many positive outlooks like keeping the voting system fair and not giving too much power either side when voting the subject although many americans believe that the electoral college causing the wrong presidents win does not make difference either way because the way that the electoral college evens out the votes the electoral college fair and suitable system for the united states and should kept america voting system,582,0.0051546391752577,4
the electoral college process begun long time ago due the lack educated and literate citizens the united states whom the government did not believe were eligible vote for any president under any circumstances now that our literacy rate the united states now more than believe don really think that the electoral college useful anymore the electoral college process describing electors voted for the state who will vote for the new president every four years majority vote one more than half required elect the new president the number electors for each state equals the number members congressional delegation meaning one for each member the house representatives that represents your state and two for your senators however think that popular vote having the citizens themselves vote for the president may more useful there off chance that electors may vote for candidate that their citizens did not want choose the chance that two slates electors may sent congress etc another prospect the idea tie the electoral vote which would mean that there would votes for both presidential candidates the event this happening the election would thrown the house representatives which the state delegations would choose the president this may fatal however because states like wyoming which only have the population will have much say about the fate the united states state like california home million people lot people usually are favor the electoral college due certainty outcome and swing states swing toss states are the states that are undecided until the very end and could very well change the entire tide the election voters toss states reads one argument are more likely pay close attention the campaign really listen the competing candidates knowing that they are going decide the election but should really leave such large and important decision such few people mere and even less for toss states overall think that the electoral college outdated due lack need anymore does not fit the democratic and equal methods the united states for the most part and leaves too large decision too small group popular voting may just the solution this problem and although popular voting may not perfect either might help figure out who really need for our president rather than leaving just small group,537,0.0,4

many people across the country would believe that having electoral college good idea well belive thost not good idea continue having electoral college chose our president because the people deserve have their votes count the process having electoral college the popular votes not count only the slate electors can vote for the canidate that not even the worst part begin with source says that percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now that more than half the amount voters the country even states the same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party canidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please meaning that sometimes the electors would not always have the same idea mind the people have that real bummer especially for the people the state with those kinds electors furthermore the electoral college may have few benefits states source fore example says the electoral college avoids the problem elections which canidate receives majority the votes cast meaning that barely anyone would vote the state but that usually rare ocasion and easily avoided every state individuals would usually not avoid coming vote election for certain positions especially when comes president sometimes people would even let the electoral college vote for them without the people knowing who they voted for the electoral college supposed represent their state towards canidate but what the state rarely has any electors represented doesn have any all that why the people make their own decision who they want vote for and hopefully their vote counts the electoral college may recommended represent their state but they can never represent every individual vote because not all people have the same canidate mind and the electoral college can only vote for one canidate overall think the electoral college should abolished every way the people vote that should count not the electors some people may disagree but still believe the electoral college not good for not truely fair have the majority popular votes one canidate and still that canidate does not win due the electoral college can most certainly agree with what previous people and groups have said before such richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce and the afl cio get rid the electoral college,518,0.0135135135135135,4

opinion think that driverless cars would wonderful thing have they would make much easier commute and from work school they would also make taking long roadtrips much more enjoyable being that you would not always have keep starring the road ahead the long boring sort way that have now driverless cars would also great for public transportation being that they could exempt the need for driver that would allow companies make more profit which turn would allow for better keep the buses trams etc also allowing for newer and better modes transportation purchased all around would benefit the public transportation industry even did not have autonomous driverless cars the roads would still better had cars that sensed the road conditions and kept track the driver help with accident prevention would decrease the number deaths caused each year distracted driving and also maybe even help make the human population whole better drivers the fact that would realize all the things that wrong while driving and maybe try correct those things then there the other side the autonomous driverless cars yes they would good because they would decrease the number accidents that are caused distracted divers but this may also bad thing most humans you give them something that can make them have work less will rely sourly that one product all that can possibly help them but when that product has malfunction could disasterous lets use this example johnny and few his friends are driving twisty mountain road his autonomous car johnny relying his autonomous car its job driving paying attention the road ahead the driving system the car has small malfunction the turning system the road takes sharp right turn and the cars going too fast recognize that the turn ahead the car comes the turn goes fast around the turn and starts slip the car then overcorrect sending johnny and all his friends straight into the side the mountain now see this would have been problem had johnny been paying attention the road ahead but thought that his autonomous car had all under control the autonomous car would great innovation driving but when human nature takes over and rely too much the product things such this may happen,508,0.0098425196850393,4
agree that the facial action coding system identify humans emotions these are some the reasons that agree with the facial action coding system classroom computer could recognize whan student becoming confused bored this could allow the teacher help them with out the student feeling like she are the only one not understand and this could allow them get help from the teacher another reason you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow the computer well give you things that you enjoy your screen you can intersected buy something this reason think that the facial action coding system bad ida for the computers then associated each with characteristic movements the facial muscles you really want computer knowing everything about you for example how you are feeling today what kind thing you like watch the things you are interested but also this computer understands you like one does and this why think the facial action coding system good idea,211,0.0094786729857819,2

cars have been used the main means transportation for long time now but just because have counted for such long time doesnt mean there are not better ways there are ton advantages for limiting car usage lower emissions conserving resources and make more healthier are just some the reasons ways that limiting car usage will improve our daily lifestyles begin with one the advantages limiting car usage improved emissions today cities all around are poisoning people with toxic air cars being the main contributes but doesnt have this way some cities are doing things change paris after days near record pollution the city enforced partial driving ban clear the global city also bogota columbia has made difference incorporating yearly day without cars one day out the entire year not going clear the global air quality but does opens peoples eyes alternative ways getting around without the use cars businessman even reported that good opportunity take aways stresses for the first time two other columbian cities have joined the event all this just proves that cars arent the only way addition lowering emissions another advantage limiting car usage would conserve resources think about how many cars are the world there are alot every car the world uses resources keep running even electric and hybrid cars eventhough they are great alternative but most use fossil fuels the world doesnt have unlimited supply fossil fuels took millions years make the gas put our cars eventually will run out and when will take very long time get back also think about the generation people after what will leave behind for them lastly limiting the use cars will improve our heath before the invention cars most the population who walk eventhough would take longer get from place place will benefit use also american sadly probably the laziest county the world you rarely see people walking riding bike and form work daily basis eventhough real busy cities you probably would get and from work faster cause you wouldnt have wait the morning evening rush hour its also creeper than using your cars you are going spend ridiculous amount money gas year think will help the environment and your wallet study last year has showed that driving young people has decreased percent between and maybe are the generation make the change other ways getting around advantages being lower emissions conservation resources and healthier you just remember the next time you have the store just take bike,578,0.0155709342560553,4
does students emotions matter classroom using technology see their emotions actually useful the answer that yes the use technology read the emotional expressions students classroom valuable students facial expressions can say lot about how they feel what they through and with the help technology teachers maybe able see what works get their students more happy the following you will read why technology can actually help read students facial expressions humans mostly use facial expressions and emotions show how they feel rather than talking about them usually humans can tell how another person feels looking their expressions but other times humans just hide emotional expressions are very important human communication especially student class studying because then the teacher can help and see how the student feels that where technology comes teachers not always know what when the students are bored upset but technology can help with that huang says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor paragraph alto this shows that the computer can help change the students emotions help learning more interesting for them the computer can change its screen according how the student feels about huang says for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different paragraph alto the author shows how the students can choose what they want see make learning more interesting for them with the help technology sometimes students dont want talk about their feelings when they have this program their classroom the students will have smile certain things that they can watch what they want see smiling helps lot with emotion and feelings the author writes according the facial feedback theory emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them paragraph alto this shows that the more students smile for the computers the more happy they may also feel the author writes empathy feeling someone else emotional state may happen because unconsciously imitate another person facial expressions paragraph alto the author states how one persons feelings can affect others the computer can also that student letting them see things that make them happy students may struggle with certain things that they are currently learning the computer can help make easier and more fun for the student understand teachers often just teach the way they know how and they dont pay enough attention the students emotions and facial expressions technology can join the student and help teach him her the way that they enjoy this can lead good grades and more happiness its like computer can have and understand human emotions that some humans may have difficulty understanding the author writes course most would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc paragraph alto this shows that humans are normally not capable telling anothers humans emotions the author writes vinci studied human anatomy help them paint facial muscles precisely enough convey specific emotions his new computer software stores similar anatomical information paragraph alto this shows that the new computers have the capability see how human feeling and help the students with learning the facial action coding system has found brilliant way helping students learn emotions can really affect how certain student concentrating education and sometimes can even take over humans use facial expressions show their emotional expressions and when their computer sees how they feel can make more fun and interesting for the student learn students dont have even mention their feelings the computer can just see students tend smile that they can see what they want see the use technology read the emotional expressions student classroom definitely valuable,819,0.0048840048840048,4
find the ideas behind the electoral college extremely ridiculous and claim completely justifiable and backed why vote for some one youre actually only voting for board people who could possibly not vote for the canidate your choice there also always chance your canidate winning popular vote and still losing electoral there also the idiotic winner take all system that most states have place this winner take all system means that canidate recieve majority the states votes they get all the votes for that state find irrational because you going vote for board members who may may not vote for the person which you are rooting for why even vote while this possibility extremly low there still always chance may happen the way the voting system set your canidate can win popular vote more than their opponent and still lose lower score electoral vote there have been cases which this happened well gore richard nixon final point against the electoral college the winner take all system states use when comes voting this sytem makes that long there majority state the person that has that majority has all the votes for the state some counterclaims that state that should keep the electoral college enacted state that there will always swing states this means that instead going lots states they the few states that they know could pulled either president over all find the current system voting total disgrace our glorious country its zubair unjust and complete mess believe that should act immediately upon this system and shut dewon soon possible,361,0.0193905817174515,3
begin explanation informing fellow citizens about the advantages limiting car usage that cars are changing the way live today harming the ecosystem harming ways that dont even realize such health and financially many have been stunned the effects that our vehicles cause our world making less sustainable place for wildlife and our children polluting the air breathe increasing the percentage smog that over takes our fresh air and taking down natural areas for our doings such highways and new roads for example europe has day car use for whole day because the greenhouse effect and for that smog starting decrease congestion went down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog but diesel fuel was blamed for the smog because the tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline dispels make percent vehicles france paris has more smog than any other european capitals but not only affecting europe beijing china which said one the most polluted cities earth much harm being done our wolrd but many are blind even notice that why have make change limiting car usage the facts are staring the face and have the power make difference the way our vehicles are harming physically making more lazy even jog couple blocks without grasping for air like fish out water turning into obese unhealthy individuals many people prefer using cars get destination which walking distance than use their own legs which pathetic for those that dont mind the stroll are making the difference for example study last year found that driving young people decreased percent between and for that being many people getting license not priority and that being those people organize their lifestyle have social life around them they can walk work the grocery store and home not owning vehicle making their lives more healthier and social the individuals that were mentioned earlier are the opposite they are harming their health sitting car for couple minutes hours which could lead chain events stay home all day watch television become more social through technology but less social outside and become more obese person many people are having problems paying off there cars because being too expensive causing them have financial issues making them live their car for not having enough money even buy place live eat and that causes them lose their car which would make them homeless which would have them struggling even more life with all the situations that going todays world and for that being persuading people buy the,554,0.0054151624548736,3

would have say that favor moving forward and progressing towards driverless cars there are quite few reasons why believe great idea after the idea perfected roads will much safer the cost transportation will down and also could possibly make transporting roads much faster the idea this driverless car quite astonishing but once perfected will open doors new opportunities transporting roads for example the car would able sense cars that human could possibly not see this would make the amount car accidents down also some states have already allowed computer driven cars the road says the passage this demonstrates that these driverless cars are becoming safer everyday also says the article that manufacturers believe the number states allow driverless cars only going continue rising they advance there search for safer and possibly cheaper cars solutions one other reason that believe that these cars are great idea because says that the cars can make for cheaper transportation for example states the article that sergey brin cofounder google believes that the fuel amount needed these futuristic cars will half what use today would able less harm the environment using less fuel also sergey brin states that taxis would more flexible and safe this reduces the risk having taxi driver that might put you danger although these cars will much safer there are many more reasons agree with driverless cars one final reason believe driverless cars ill much faster get from place place for example autonomous car could certain speed much higher than the current highway speed limits and sense any danger would able much faster speed but also keep the roads jus safe all all there still much research done for these cars perfected and able driven the roads legally although continue advance driverless cars the generations after will see roads much different then today they will see much safer faster and cheaper way moving around,452,0.0110619469026548,3
the development driverless cars should allowed driverless cars would probably make driving safer all throughout the nation these cars would probably also easier handle and make driving more enjoyable these days there the technology help smarter cars prosper driverless cars may have some challenges but like the article states these cars would change the world driverless cars are much safer than the conventional cars that are used today there are many reckless drivers out there that cause car accidents and deaths just about every day according the second paragraph the article the driverless cars created google have driven over half million miles without crash driverless cars would operate smoothly and theoretically they could eliminate the possibility for human error under specific conditions some cars have been able drive independently since this could imply that might not that long before driverless cars start take over driverless cars would make transportation much easier since attention would only needed rare state emergency the driver can mostly just sit back and relax according the eighth paragraph the article some manufacturers plan develop car entertainment and information systems that use heads displays the displays can aslo used alert the driver necessary today most drivers have constantly vigilant for harmful threats the road driverless cars the other hand will allow the driver something fun and relaxing while being automatically taken destination modern techonology has allowed driverless cars fully developed with less complications according the fourth paragraph the article google modified normal car adding many different sensors there are also video camera automotive radar sensors gps receiver and motion sensors the technology has finally caught make driverless cars possibility driverless cars may still need modifications because there are still faults dealing with traffic and roadwork despite these challenges driverless cars are still the best option for transportation this nation cars have been driven for over century enhancing cars driverless would start revolution transportation driverless cars are one the safest and easiest option for traveling just few years with manufacturers making more modifications and states modifying some traffic laws driverless cars will truly change the world,450,0.0133333333333333,4

driverless cars have the potential revolutionary terms how cars are made and how they function this sounds fun and exciting but think important step back and see what really being offered here these cars will change life know important that officials look how these cars will affect not only the country but the world technology great thing but tend forget the many negatives that along with the positives think that forget that this what happening with driverless cars need stop looking this the terms the big technological advancement that and really look how these cars are being produced lives are risk not this why recommend that manufactures halt any plans for driverless cars for immediate future like have stated before technology great thing but opinion technology only good the person behind the technology manufactures driverless need absolutely sure they are using top the line equipment insure the occupants safety and sure that failure next impossible likewise the goverment needs work with the manufacture insure that and when their product does fail that the manufacture protected from any legal action that may arise from the improper maintainence and operation said product there are laws like this for almost any product available but when something new like the driverless car developed new laws must made cover this new product the present time since driverless cars are not readily available the the public such laws exists cover driverless car manufactures laws are important they protect and everyone around from harm the previous paragraph dicussed laws protect the manufacture from liability the case human error now would like touch something that extremely important know when operating motor vehicle traffic laws are extremely important the efforts keep drivers passangers and pedestrians safe from any and all harm that may result from the improper operation motor vehicle however such laws are place regarding driverless vehicles because the lawmakers who make the laws and the law enforcment officers entrusted with the duty see that they are obeyed and carried out assume that car truck suv must have driver order manuever safely and effectively through around any obstacle might encounter driverless car built must have the capability ensure that passangers are safe and that the operation said car will not endanger the safety other vehicles and there occupants driverless cars sound like great idea but can not foresee any good that can come out building such car the laws and safety regulations are not place protect both consumer and manufacture ensure that the upmost care taken when building such machine and also ensure the safety the car occupants well the occupants the other vehicles that share the road with this car lastly there are laws ensure that the manufacture protected from liability the case accident that results from human error until these laws are place can not see driverless cars being something worth consideration,648,0.0231481481481481,4

technology extremely helpful our everyday lives and great way interact with people use gather information and learn well overall communicating with people all over the world but really need guide human emotion emotional technology could actually keep from understanding people our own and could make too dependent electronics you have friend family member who always knows how you feeling even you trying hide analyzing other people emotions good way for people understand eachother and grow close with one another but technology takes away our ability that our own the author making mona lisa smile states fact humans perform this same impressive calculation every day for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face this clearly way show how humans minds naturally can the same job the facial action coding system humans rely computers and technology tell how other people are feeling don need figure out our own and are always relying technology and not using our own experiences and analytical skills then will eventually lose our abilities understand others our own people the modern day are already very dependent technology can not let tear down our social skills having emotion generator can slowly tear people social skills and will make less able relate people identifying other feelings can give people sense closeness understanding and relation that other person and constantly rely technology those things for would seem though are losing connection from person person and are making connection from person technology some people believe that technology keeping from the simple things life and are more engaged our cell phones than engaging with people nature any our surroundings that particular case would using technology read people make connected with electronics would allow further connect with people the answer fairly simple nobody knows you better than you know yourself and that means that nobody knows people better than people themselves have been able read people faces and emotions since the beginning time and are still currently able technology can read the psychology humans well humans likely can why would add the element technology interfere with person person contact important that people are able associate with other people without depending other resources and including technology help would the long run actually hinder person had understand humans enough create this kind technology instead making everyone dependent technology why don allow people understand humans more their own conclusion although technology can useful technology determining emotions could effect our generation negative way humans were born being able understand basic human emotion and should not take away that skill from others through relying technology,637,0.0,4

driverless cars are coming everything our society based science and technology cars are also developing from human control driverless the article the left introduces how big companies for instance google bmw etc are trying make driverless cars come into our daily life and how the law will change have driverless cars commonly once driverless cars come into our life people will argue that good develop driverless cars bad opinion have positive aspects driverless cars the first and the most direct reason because driverless cars can make our daily life much more convenient than before don need worry about which road are driving any places haven been before the car will drive for will have plan for which road direction the second reason the driverless cars are safer than people driving themselves sometimes people can not drive safely when they are tired get drunk that can make huge accident but the driverless cars can help drive the information from the sensors can cause the car apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone passage using the sensor the car don need worry about safety anymore the sensor can control the car and give much safer trip than ever before the third reason driverless cars can reduce the quantity accidents when people are using the driverless cars they must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires this necessitates the car being ready quickly get the driver attention whenever problem occurs passage although driverless car drivers still need pay attention convenience safety reduction accidents these are the reasons choose use the driverless cars there huge number people who still have negative aspects the driverless cars technologies need improve can improve our phones our computers but why not cars the driverless cars the symbol the improvement technologies and driverless cars can bring lot benefits our life can get more convenient and safer than before,454,0.0044052863436123,4

transportation vehicle like car very common these days efficient way travel for the most part and has been used option for traveling since the early although cars have many upsides they also have downsides too limiting car usage more places there could many advantages first could improve safety also will conserve resources and lastly limiting car usage will allow tremendous decrease pollution limiting car usage will improve safety number ways limiting car usage there will most likely decrease deaths since many car accidents result fatality not only cars colliding with other cars that the issue cars having the power destroy most things comes contact with cars are not toys but rather death machines they have the ability cause major damage which why limited usage enforced there will most likely less accidents resulting major minor injuries even death there are many options for getting around besides using car for example there are electric scooters mopeds skateboards rollerskates bicycles and even good old fashioned walking while some these could potentially dangerous they are probably not dangerous driving car another reason limiting car usage could beneficial the conservation resources cars are heavy machinery and need abundance fuel keep them going for years and years what powers most vehicles currently fossil fuel fossil fuel not everlasting resource and will gone someday now there are some cars that run electricity but for the most part cars around the world run fossil fuel considering that there are about one two cars per household nowadays that would mean both cars are probably getting filled with gas even being charged with electricity which could run your electricity bill through the roof since this applies most people around the world think the resources being used daily this usage resources could lessened just limiting the usage cars the last benefit limiting car usage less air pollution cars run fossil fuel stated the previous paragraph when car being driven that fuel exits the car gas state this gas form fuel very harmful the environment with many cars the road today the atmosphere already polluted great deal usually you will see signs that read idling outside store any public area where cars are allowed which means that when you are parked and are going parked for extended period time you should turn your car off that does not let out gas paris partial driving ban was actually enforced that the amount smog the air would decrease that how much the usage cars can affect environment overall setting limitation car usage more places can have benefits could improve safety conserve resources and allow for less pollution the environment with these reasons don see many reasons for people frown upon this idea,624,0.0,4
dear senator believe that people like richard nixon jimmy carter and bob dole were all right saying the electoral college should abolished have two simple reasons for this one being that not way elect entire nations leader for four years the other reason being that people don even want first off the process the electoral college isn always accurate for example gore ran for office against george bush during this election gore won the votes the people but lost electoral votes giving the presidency george since all know how his presidency turned out wonder how gore would handled things voters can not always control who their electors vote for which means elector chosen vote for billy joe might just decide when becomes time vote for jimmy washington this would leave voters that candidate upset maybe they too will understand this flawed system another reason need abolish the electoral college something like call the disaster factor this nothing compared what happened the system allows for much worse consider that states legislature technically responsible for picking said states electors also consider that said elector could always defy the will the people the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing democratic electors with new ones who would oppose john kennedy the same vein electors without faith have occasionally refused vote for their party canidate and cast their vote for whomever they please ask yourself senator this were happen again would you what right and try dispose this system hope reference second point you realize that according gallup poll our people don even want this system the way see asked three people should buy new car used car and two out the three say should buy used one not going buy new car despite them this the same with the electoral college shouldn forcing this corrupt way deciding this nations leader for the next four years down their throat this nation based beliefs that include the peoples right have say how this nation governed simple majority the people are against the electoral college needs you like the united states agree with points and views the electoral college then you need what you can with your authority put stop all all have strong beliefs like most americans that the electoral college corrupt way giving this great nation somebody who people think don deserve based emphasis these two reasons that this failing system needs think you senator need put all your power into the downfall,614,0.004885993485342,4

dear florida senator would say lets get rid the electoral college vote the reason because the voters vote for slate electors they really are not letting the people speak their mind about who should really president like said the story and quote sometimes the slate electors might vote for the other side also says the passage that the electoral college vote unfair outdated and irrational the electoral college vote just waste time honest another reason why think should get rid the electoral college vote because really doesn make any sense have the popularity vote should the one that counts the reason because gives the voters the chance vote for the president instead having that electoral college vote where they can just easily just vote for the new president the other thing that the electoral college votes goes slate electors well some states have more electors than others like california and texas all states should have equal amount voters instead just giving the big states the all the power the last reason why think should get rid the electoral college vote because the disaster factor the year fiasco was the biggest election crisis segregationists louisiana the legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors who would oppose john kennedy the other thing what their tie between the two the whole election would thrown the house representives these are all the reasons why think should get rid the electoral college votes because more easy doing the popularity vote because gives the people speak who they want president,345,0.0144927536231884,3

fellow scientist thinks that there life mars because the human face that was found mars but can give him three reasons why there isn any life mars and that the face mars just natural landform one reason that the face based the photo looks lot like landforms earth second reason that there was any chance that there was life mars nasa would keep themselves final reason that cydonia has many other known mesas why would this one special and admit does look little bit like face but with the better graphics the face looks nothing like face was very popular because made people believe life mars but with the enhanced graphics the popularity this face went down because people started realizing that was not face also looks almost the exact same the middle butte the snake river plain idaho this face was made aliens nasa would more than likely keep themselves nasa were tell this the public saying that was extraterrestrial made landform the whole entire world would freak out they would most likely terrified the aliens another reason since the united states nasa found this they wouldn want other countries know about this could the ones discover life mars before the rest the world the region cydonia mars there are lot other mesas and buttes why would this one any different martians made mesa that looks like face why would they put around other mesas they would most likely put region that doesn draw attention keep there life secret conclusion the face mars just natural landform because looks like landforms earth cydonia has lot more known mesas this another its many mesas and last but not least nasa would never tell the world that there extraterrestrial life mars,435,0.0022988505747126,4
imagine having piece technology tell you how you feeling not think that the use technology read our emotions would valuable classroom they were used the students may get mad could bother the teacher would costly and takes regular upkeep technology was used classrooms would not valuable the students the classrooms sometimes want hide how they feel about someone something and having machine track what they feel could trigger them student can sometimes hide their anger about student assignment but this was applied would obvious another reason they wouldn valuable because reads the wrong emotion someone they person anger emotion may rise and become even larger ordeal someone can already tell what felt just looking someone face for the most part the author stated paragraph there point have have machine the same thing friend would also able see you are faking smile hiding what you really feel the teachers also are another reason they wouldn hold any value second reason that the machine not worth because the teachers responses teacher may now see how student feels about something and this could lead more disciplinary issues the teacher may feel annoyed the students become amused and there would not point teaching paragraph six says then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor and this shows that they are becoming like teacher and this could lead decrease available jobs kind like what happening with robots the placement these machines classrooms could cause more stress teachers and more worry about top the student needs they aren only bad idea because the teachers and students but also the upkeep the final reason they should not placed classrooms because the price and upkeep the machines would not cheap purchase and the schools have better items buy for the school the school have hire more people make sure they are always working and this also using more the schools money the device would like any other piece technology and would also require updates the vinci code would not totally accurate every time and that could lead disruption nick alto says your home can handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile which shows how complicated the machine and how easily could misinterpret emotions conclusion the placement technology classrooms would hold value they would distraction students have negative effects teachers and entail large cost and major upkeep,573,0.0017452006980802,4

the article making mona lisa smile the author describes how new technology facial action coding system enables computers identify human emotions think this technology would not have much use classroom there are many emotions that the human brain daily consistent basis there just possible way that artificial intelligence could make accurate reading student for example humans are not these focus machines that only think about school work while they are doing student could easily get side tracked and think about something else whether sad happy emotion this could theoretically set off the facial coding system and give the student inaccurate reading another real life example say student working his math problems and the student totally gets the problems and breeze but say gets sidetracked and thinks about something else earlier the day that puzzled him what the facial coding system picked that clearly would not give accurate reading hypothetically would pick the students confusion and move him onto another question the problem with the facial coding system that wouldn analyzing perfect subject what mean that that humans clearly have error what mean that the facial coding system were engaged student feel like would have hard time getting accurate reading how the student actually doing their school work not only would this system most likely very inaccurate but what about the cost the facial coding system technology and artificial intelligence like this would outrageously expensive not only would this system most likely ineffective but would also very pricey imagine the thousands kids each public school then add the expense the coding system each their computers school funding may not even enough fund all that let alone the students who would paying for them just not realistic all conclusion think that the facial action coding system would both ineffective and expensive product that schools certainly could not utilize benefit from all,422,0.0047393364928909,4

the electoral college process put place the founding fathers compromise for the election the president combination vote the congress and the citizens the united states the electoral college the most disputed political topics right now the electoral college proper method for electing presidents because forces presidential candidates have transregional appeal and rules out the possibility election where neither candidate recieve the majority the votes the electoral college doesn allow candidate win gaining their electoral votes from one region stated source region has enough electoral votes elect president meaning that candidate were only campaign region that they knew would vot for them then there possible way they would win for example mitt romney was favorite the south had incentive campaigning heavily other states because that had won the south over completely not only did not win major electoral state florida but also didn campaign rohter states for which gained electoral votes even some chance that they win there very small chance them being reelected because the regions that they didn campaign will feel disenfranchised and that will cause them not vote for the president again candidate doesn camapign all regions that doesn mean won win the election the first time but likely lose the reelection with the electoral college process place rules out the possibility candidate not winning the majority the votes for example their have been two elections where president only had percent the popular votes which some people would think that would enough but the those presidents had the majority the electoral votes which what caused them win even though there slight possibility this happening there are always those couple states that are last minute decisions and are called toss states because nobody ever knows who will win that state over and might state like louisiana who only has electoral votes but votes enough break tie and even win the election for someone the other hand some people might argue that the electoral college method might turn off potential voters due candidate showing that they have interest carrying that state due what party that state carries but one voter can decide election and that because the voter doesn vote for what president they want but for what electors they want who part will vote for the candidate though they have valid arguement the electoral college still the right method for the job conclusion the electoral college the proper method because forces presidents campaign multiple regions and rules out the possibility tie the election the president suppose rule for the people and some people might not vote for president just because they don like them but with the electoral college the right president wins,609,0.0049261083743842,4

the founding father wanted good amount power the people the president wont have full control over the country with the electoral collage act will give less power the people gives more power the electors and the disaster factor the electoral collage gives less power the people this true because the people have vote for elector instead the president himself people may get confuse who voting for who ultimately the only types votes that actually matter end being the electors votes sometimes faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please this makes the peoples votes almost worthless electoral collage gives more power the electors the founding father wanted give power all the people not small groups them stae legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people this means the electors have the vote not the people when the actual people vote they basically flipped coin hoping that some person they don know voted for the right guy the electors vote what matters not the peoples the single best argument against the electoral collage what might call the disaster factor the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse state legislatures pick the electors and these electors can disregard the people votes and pick who ever they want back segregationists the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john kennedy the electoral collage system bad idea because gives less power the people gives more the electors and disaster factor,348,0.014367816091954,4

cars are very large help for transportation although they have alot defects our environment our laziness and our safety the first reason should limit car use our environment doesn get ruined the fumes our vehicles are relapsing into the air are creating large addition the greenhouse gases for example semis diesel cars diesel trucks and other vehicles when you rev the gas pours out black smoke into the environment when you see truck this you think nothing but overtime and with every single car and truck that does adds very quickly another reason should limit our car usage because increases our laziness instead driving school when only minutes away you could just walk you walked you would lose little weight and even saving your gas money you are close the place you want then you might well just walk benefits you many ways saving money losing weight and getting more fit one the most important reasons should limit our car usage for our own safety deaths car accidents one the most leading causes death now days would you rather walk ride bike the location you want would you rather risk your life driving and somebody deboning you and injuring even killing you not that you should but some people sometimes can get into crash with you and then just drive off whether was your fault theirs now you have pay for the damages done your vehicle you are going drive because you live far away from everything simply car pull alot easier and everyone throws down little money then you aren spending that much gas diesel riding bike great solution limiting car usage because one time purchase once you buy the bike you don have pay for fuel also better than walking because far faster general driving has advantages and disadvantages although you are close your location then riding bike would ideal lower car usage,434,0.0138248847926267,2

dear state senator aware that there are two ways electing the president the united states according source what the electoral college the electoral college process where electors get elected vote for president and vice president the other option popular vote popular vote when the people vote and which ever candidate gets the most votes wins the election personally feel that you should not keep the electoral college opinion election popular vote better strategy electing the president and vice president the united states electoral college horrible strategy because voters are not actually voting for the president they are voting for slate electors there are other reasons why believe that popular vote more accurate way electing the president and vice president the united states under the electoral college system voters don actually get vote for the president and vice president according source what wrong with the electoral college the voters vote for slate electors who will elect the president possible that the voters may not even know much about the electors that will electing the president the electors can anyone depends what state you are according source what wrong with the electoral college sometimes the electors may elected state conventions the state party central committee the presidential candidates themselves voters can even control who their electors vote for sometimes what voters choose elector and the elector doesn even vote for the president that the voter was hoping they will vote for that seems unfair because during this process there chance that the voter may not even get actually vote for the candidate that they wanted vote for this why feel that popular vote more accurate voters get vote for the candidate that they want win the president and know that their vote will count they don have worry about electing elector that can possibly vote for different candidate may you please consider removing the electoral college and replacing with popular vote sure will make many voters happy that their vote will actually count and that they will not have vote for elector,469,0.0,3

driverless cars something everyone should look into right well say that statement clearly against the use driverless cars people might often say but are becoming more advanced why are you against that not against becoming more advanced civilization but just think that the cars are worthless and not good idea and here why driverless cars require you the driver still alert even though there computer driving this because the computer can not travel through obstacles such tough terrains bad roads that call for human experience the car driven computer that should actually make able handle any situation right but yoest people still want produce this also bad idea because think the money that will have spent creating all these automobiles this project could cost billions and billions dollars just equip the technology within the vehicle itself let alone the cost actually make the cars the technology might not issue all for many people around the world but the money definately issue the taxes and monthly revenues might even higher just fund the project make these cars finally cars should not driver less because they cost way too much money which states the article that radar was device hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars this true then think about all the money that will paid the future due the many advancements technology the cars still call for driver touch the thing that these cars are not fully able drive without someone and just waste time and money make something that still has require that human operate and control also accident occurs then who blame shmuley not the manufacture they weren the car but wait their technology was accident happens then this could cause problems between people and the manufactures because the technolgy was the control the car but yet the person was the car fully capable driving the time exactly who blame for the incident here why cars should not driverless because they cost way too much money they also need you alert all times just case there obstacle the road and finally they could cause problems between manufactuers and people because accident happens then who blame for simple cars should not driverless,545,0.0110091743119266,4

have you heard the facial action coding system also known facs technology that can identify human emotions such happiness sadness anger fear disgust and surprise this would not useful school classrooms students for many reasons but could still valuable some situations school begin one reason the facs wouldn useful use school students because school for getting education and learning school not for figuring out whether student happy sad for that reason the facs would not useful also using the facs students would take time and waste when students could learning which what they should doing school basically the school should focused education students and not trying tell their emotions using technology secondly the facs would not useful because some students may not want used them students don need technology show what emotion they are feeling when the student their self knows what their current emotions are and the school used the facs would waste time for the students who didn need want disagree using the facs also some parents could disagree and not want the school the use the facs their students the school the other hand using the facs could valuable for example student being bullied would useful use situation like that also would useful teacher was trying something new the classroom and the teacher could see whether her students were happy not with the facs could also come handy and useful and valuable acting drama classes the facs could used tell how good students are acting out emotions conclusion using the facial action coding system facs can tell emotions such happiness sadness anger surpise disgust and fear the facs wouldn that valuable school because some students may not want others know their real emotions and also using the facs school would not valuable because school for education and learning not for figuring out emotions although the facs could valuable use school drama acting classes tell how good bad students are acting out certain emotions which they aren currently feeling,483,0.0020703933747412,4

how does the author support the idea venus being dangerous but still worthy studying well the article can see that there are many ways the author supports this idea for example when the author talks about venus being inhospitable also when nasa shows how there might have been life venus before and when the author talks about how venus atmosphere huge risk all these reasons show how the author supports the idea venus being dangerous but still worth studying for first all when the author talks about how inhabitable venus shows what the author knows about venus for example when the text says venus has the hottest surface temperature clearly shows that human can live there because what conditions under also the text when says astronomers are fascinated venus shows that the planet worth studying for but can also really dangerous can see that this one reason why venus can worth studying for but can also very dangerous second all when says that nasa has discovered many different reasons where venus used have life show another reason where why worth studying there has never been another planet that has been found have mankind life but the text when says venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life this also shows that venus worth studying when the article says weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes shows how dangerous venus can based the information the passage shows that venus can worth studying but with slight risk lastly when the text talks about how venus atmospheres are super risky and dangerous the text when says thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus shows how dangerous venus can the text when also says today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth shows how venus still can worth studying even our present days these peaces information from the text shows how venus has its ups and downs from studying the end can see that the author supports the idea studying venus dangerous but worthy when the text talks about how venus inhabitable when nasa talks about venus having some life before and when shows how the atmosphere can risky all these examples shows how the author supports the idea risking study venus but also being worth clearly the end can see how does the author support this idea the information that the passage,499,0.0040080160320641,4

think that facial action coding system would good thing have schools would help teachers figure out what would more fun and interesting for the kids learn without them falling asleep day dreaming you had back school would you rather write paper watch video something you liked was interested other then something you hate doing would much easier stay focused and task when think school dont find fun something looking forward going but they could give assignments that liked and had fun doing then everything would easier for the students and the teachers would have less stress alot teachers can already tell that some students dont want school and they can tell there grades but who wouldnt want come school was actually fun interesting they could use the computers for when they give essays videos watch they noticed you didnt like the topic then they could change and find something the whole class likes not just one person they could also use know what subjects need could use help yea think its little creepy have something looking you but can help get your grades and could get you better job the future why not they could know what work sheets are harder then others and see what they need cover class more alot students dont like sitting class reading book that they dont find interesting because they get bored and tired listening and then they slack off and shows there grades states the artifical that you smile when web appears the screen similar might fallow but you frown the next will different this could help all the boring time you have spend watching adds commerical you were interested then then you would have better experience and you would more likley buy the item and you didnt like the then they wouldnt show and would something els think that they should put facs classrooms that the teachers could help there students more personal way also would better for the students learn about the software they might have use the future they start using think there would major change schools around evansville and would help out many people get jobs later life they could also use many different ways the everyday life,524,0.0171755725190839,3

hello writing you about the electoral college and why that think should removed why think should remove the electoral college when voter selects the president they want they are really just picking for elector who elects the president for them also this makes single rep from wyoming people has much say reps for california who represents million people the last reason behind this also being unfair voters the winner take all system where the state the winner the votes gets them all effect candidate would spend time that per say swing state which the may have chance winning when you vote for the president you really are not voting for him you voting for elector who really elect the president also the question brought who picks the electors this also depends the state could the state party central committee the presidential candidate people also another question what controls the elector from electing the wrong candidate nothing also why does single reps wyoming with people have much say reps california with million people that just unfair the voters how could that anyway represent what the majority the people want the other way the electoral collage unfair the winner take all system mentioned earlier with majority votes state the state vote such percent people state voted one candidate and for the other winsted just giving the candidates their votes the majority decided one would have them the electoral college also not democratic system voting because the people are really not deciding and when said you are allowing each party pick trusted slate nominees not true because the state central committee not the presidential candidate reps who are the people really needed vote for such gore had more popular votes than bush but less electoral votes though rare happen this the president who runs the country for four years time that one rare moment could mean the future the also president does not need trans regional they only need appeal swing states and not ruin relations with their states that was and reasoning why think that the electoral college should removed from our political system between the being unfair voters through voting for electors not even the president reps not even being scaled right also the winner take all system making the system unbalanced and the presidential candidates not even needing appeal most states just the swing states hope this passage convinces you that the electoral college should removed place better system that not out dated,550,0.0018181818181818,4

personally think that driverless cars are not good idea they seem very dangerous and although might seem cool you will still have give your full attention the road not more like stated paragraph none these cars are completely driverless you will have watch out for construction and traffic accidents and take control another good reason too why should not begin using driverless cars would people might fall asleep driving night for long period time can make you very tired and you might doze off what you are postion where you need paying attention the road and you are asleep that your life the line and anyone else that might out the roads with that being said think could good training technique for people that are handicapped blind giving them sense independence think would useful but very much against driverless cars seems like accident waiting happen,207,0.0193236714975845,2

many people may argue that the landscape the picture taken was landscape made aliens these people think the landscape was created alien because the picture resembled human head with eyes nose and mouth fact this image became popular the next years that started show books and magazines some people still think that the landscape was created aliens however the face was created aliens has been proven false because the the new data and research over the next years showed that was just mesa scientists examined this photo actually prove the landscape was actually made aliens not after research our nasa scientists and proved that was just mesa which are common around cydonia become more factual about this the mars global surveyor flew over cydonia and took more pictures the face this occured with better cameras than the first ones taken the picture became times clearer than the first picture taken which led our conclusion that was indeed just mesa response those who still believe that the face was created aliens our data has shown that not even took more photos showing clearly that the face just normal mesa there were human features the pictures that were taken unlike the ones from our scientists and ensure you that this just regular mesa which are common find the face from just had shadows that made look unusual,307,0.0,3
there has been argument saying that the face mars ancient civilization well they are wrong because old landform three reasons why landform because the planet mars can not support life also because just the lighting forming the eyes nose and the mouth and just landform know landform that has just eroded over hundreds years mars there oxygen water life that because the planet can not support life the planet completely dead there was civilization then they would had built house with airlocks just survive even the aliens did not need air breath they would have gotten hot and they need moisture survive and you would think that would have found civilization something that would have kept them alive now the text says would cool there was ancient civilization the landform looks like has eyes nose and mouth but really just the lighting reflecting the landform the sun hitting the landform then will cause shadow creat the look eyes nose and mouth but after many years the landform has eroded form face like look sense the planet mars has hallways been the closest the sun alot hotter than earth there hallways heat waves that what caused the rosen the landform the text states that the eyes nose and mouth are just illusion this landform because the planet completely dead mars can not support life because too hot and gets heat waves also the light reflects off the landform and creates shadow eyes nose and mouth the landform has had many years erode the text states just martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh would cool there was aliens that created the landform could see how they adapted surviving the planet and its harsh conditions they might help adapt mars and can help them adapt our planet but nasa would become more famous than what today because they would want have all the land marks for artifacts and would probably make the aliens mad the landform mars was not created aliens because would have known now also because mars can not support life the lighting the planet creates the eyes the nose and the mouth like illusion and for all know just landform know just landform that has eroded over hundreds years,538,0.0167286245353159,4

the author does not support his idea well because has little evidence back the claims that made these claims were that venus could useful because how close and called challenge for human curiosity neither the claims made were valid because would off topic provide little evidence and would talk about the benefits venus but not say what they were when claimed that venus useful because how close and said venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit crucial consideration given the long frames space travel and then said the value returning venus seems indisputable made claim saying that good thing venus but the right after said the value indisputable but never gave any evidence why its good then also claimed that has value over coming that challenge for human curiosity this bad claim because did not have much evidence reason back going venus said striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors this claim would much better actually listed any good benefits from venus also through the text the author seems either run out things support his claim went off topic because started talk about what nasa doing and planning explore venus like nasa possible solution the hostile conditions would allow scientist float above the fray would say thing what people might able explore venus with its hostile conditions but still never said what could discovered while exploring don disagree his point but how executes getting across the audience does not work provided any solid evidence what could learned discovered venus like technology new elements then would bring more people behind this idea but that still does not change the fact that his claims venus useful for future visits and its good challenge for human curiosity are not valid and does not good jobs supporting his claims,464,0.0043103448275862,4

there alot advantages limiting cars there disadvantages yes there but limiting cars can also dangerous well because the law enforcements needs cars and does the fire department even hospitals the law enforcement needs cars catch criminals faster and the fire departments need cars they can save from fires and save cats from trees how they even climb there who knows and the hospital needs them save patients get them the hospital faster doctors can save them but personally think its great idea have limited cars first all alot people would lose their jobs due limited cars such mechanics car dealers etc mechanics will out business because business and will the car dealers and cars dealers dont sell many cars the company might out business too but its good because they might think building better cars like the hybrid wont have much pollution wont have use natural gas the suburbs germany percent vauban families dont own cars and percent sold car move there when had car was always tense much happier this way said heidrun walter resident the suburb another advantage that much more peaceful and quiet the swish bicycles and the chatter wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor this sentence from the suburb life goes without cars explains that very peaceful because theres noise pollution and much more healthier people because they ride bikes everywhere and walk alot and theres pollution theres probably people who dont have breath nasty air cars even the environmental protection agency promoting car reduced communities and legislators are even starting the same people that have cars most likely walk alot and ride bikes even run well because that the amount stress people have probably very low because low stress people are happier and thats because excessive relieves stress and even reduce headaches other health problems even the death rate will decrease because there will less car accidents and car accidents are the numer one reason death and the united states bogota they were their third year where cars were banned but only buses and taxis were permitted for the day without cars this capital city million their goal promote alternative tranportation reduce nasty smog and violators faced fines the turnout this was large despite the gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers the rain hasnt stopped people from participating said the mayor bogota conclusion the advantages limited cars are great and the people car less cities areas are much happier without them people are healthier less stressed and even have less health problem due but who will save the cats from climbing trees maybe they wont climb because pollution scary car noises,599,0.003338898163606,3

dear florida senator think should change our voting system popular vote instead electoral college think this should change because the electoral college has many flaws with the way done the popular vote much more reasonable and practical one the main reasons that believe should switch because the disaster factor think that this really stood out when researching according source two the american people should consider themsleves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse the author one hundred percent correct the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and the electors can always deny the will the people this would not happen with popular vote because the people opinion translates directly who they want president another reason why the popular vote the better way because you will never get tie with the electoral votes tie possible becuase there even number electoral votes across the united states also not one citizen the unnoted states wants draw because then the house representatives would have power and state delegations would vote for the president the houses decision will almost certainly not reflect the real codice people last reason why believe that the electoral college unfair voters because the swing state votes its tight race all the way the end and theres only few states that need make final decision sometimes small state ultimately changes the end result the presidency with the popular vote this would never happen the electoral college basically says that some states are more important then others giving them more say who president popular vote counts every single person one after reading letter hope you have come come the conclusion that popular vote far better electoral college just old school not fair and can cause stupid issues that can easily avoided with popular vote popular vote will never tie let others choose who president besides the people and would never let swing state change the destiny the united states america sincerely timothy eustace,441,0.0136054421768707,4

dear state senator agre favor keeping the electoral college for this reason woulda the fact that much easier method electing presidental candiates times know can unfair most the voters around the nation but this way more easier than might already seem instead the people voting for which they think the new president would more likely the electors who elect the president for the state these slate electors are trusted vote for the party nominee for some states wouldn just random either democratic republicans when having the electors wouldbe possible the winner the electoral vote but not the national popular vote for the president chance winning having electoral college will exceed his share popular vote example would the election backing obama had percent the electoral vote compared what romen had because most the states awarded the electoral votes the winner take all basis can get chance having victory winning the electoral vote but there would possible chance having tie against the states another reason for this debate would have the reason that the candidates themselves have get the regional appeal from the states for romen that gave him opporunity but had little offer electoral votes the states that knows will win for this unsuccessful result romen only had regional appeal there for was less likely successes the southern region for other states that felt their votes didn count there for assumed that romen had little interest leading the thought unlawful candidate swing states the other hand have chance making the reason for that being voters toss states are more likely pay close attention the campaign knowing that they are going decide the election average they are are thought the most thoughtful voters the result that they have recieved more information and attention from the candidates electoral colleges balance the weight political balance that larger states lose virtue the senate for obama won that vote based the amount electoral votes recieved from florida was also from the state wyoming other reasons larger states recieve the most attention from the candidates than the small states based the information have provided you this statement will concluded that sometimes this method can little complicated most voters the for the reason that most the smaller states remain unseen the candidates the elections but sometimes winning thenpopular vote for the candidate they chose the beginning starting the electoral college was held our founding fathers this great nation there for this methodshouldremain should thank you for your consideration yours maturely proper name,565,0.0265486725663716,4

dear senator writing you letter because think that should change election popular vote for the president the united states than keeping the electoral college the reason why think that should change popular voting because every one will able have say who becomes president with the electoral college you want vote for certain president you are actually voting for electors who are pledged certain candidate and would place vote for the candidate they pledged make them president the pont those electors can bad people looking for power besides wouldn fair game the electoral college did that order make equal would like switch popular vote election but either way president still chosen the single best argument against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the system allows for much worse consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people back segregationists the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john kennedy that popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone kennedy the same vein faithless electors ave occasionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please and what state sends two slates electors congress happened hawaii luckily vice president richard nixon who was presiding over the senate validated only his opponent electors but made sure without establishing precedent what happened again excerpt from the defendable electoral college why even the best laid defenses are wrong from mother jones bradford plumer,393,0.0178117048346055,2

sure driverless cars sound interesting but are they worth the risk with the recent development driverless cars the technology for them only advancing might fun might cool but not safe not only would driverless cars dangerous themselves but theres also other issues such economy dropping the inability drive those cars specifically and several legal issues think about the future now where cars are essential everyday life for some cars are their life many people make their living off selling cars advertising cars building cars designing cars and even workers for car companies like subaru toyota ford chevy and more the radio drivers hear tons car sales and ads all the companies all the advertisements all the sales all the new designs and every last car builder were have cope with driverless cars many citizens would out job the job market for cars would collapse and would the economy leaving thousands unemployed also gas and oil would longer have anywhere near much value does now without oil and gas prices even more poeple would without jobs not mention taxes would brought everything else try and keep the economy stable but reality the rise taxes would make everyone but the government looking for loose change especially people who have more importantes things pay for like children and disability the inability operate the cars would even more issue for people wiht disabilities blind and deaf people can now least get cars that can modified adjust their ability but these driverless cars are just being made would take them even longer modify them for the disabled use even without disability the cars would like taxis what about people with social anxiety the driverless taxi causes them leave their home and fetch one for themselves social anxiety illness and affects most people one way another social anxiety can prevent someone from doing the simplest things things that even mere child could that another problem with the cars what children run away them they have the ability but this point there law against along with the development new cars there would need new laws with them people think okay drink and drive now there will even more issue that person not the one driving they drunk they could even fall asleep amd end all the way across the country because they never told the car when stop driving even when the operator the car isn drunk that could happen since there laws against they could just fall asleep while driving and cause accidents they think its okey sleep they will certainly think that texting getting social media and watching videos okay they stop paying attention the road and could get seriously hurt getting hurt won the only bad thing happen economy build people out jobs kids taking cars disability mobility legal documents could all avoided the risk wasnt taken make these driverless cars they might fascinating and new now but will worth when the economy falls apart when you lose your child get badly injured keep driverless cars off the road and keep moving forward real car stay safe,713,0.0112201963534361,4
the challenge exploring venus explain how humans are exploring venus shows the advantages and disadvantages that venus has the author suggests that studying venus worth pursuit inspite danger presents and true because don know waht out there and have prepared although good explore new things some reasons that prove the author right are that venus like the earth has his story like earth and can survive there one the reasons venus like earth that the shape and density also venus very close earth too know this because the text says often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earthing terms density and size and occasionally the closest planet distance too this evidence shows how venus maybe the gravity also like earth and true can survive there the second reason that venus started same earth has story that both planets started all covered oceans and strange things know this because the text says long ago venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth and the planet has surface rocky sediments and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters this shows how scientists have exploring venus they have their hypothesis about how did venus started and how changing scientism have curious just started with the same story like earth the third reason that can survive that planet the scientists says that the twin the earth mean that can probably have another option live venus know this because the text says not easy conditions but survivable for humans this mean that humans can have new chance life another planet not going easy but can discover new things that may help better the future nothing easy but can get know other things conclusion think the nasa should continue exploring the planet also inform about all this new thing about venus have challenge exploring new things every day and learn from would cool that can discover new things another planet such venus also feels good know that another planet the twin ours,484,0.012396694214876,4
technology has done amazing things has even changed the way society goes about their dais lives for example scientists today are trying new and creative methos get children and kids invovled with what they learning the classroom they are even going far making where computers can read your emotions this good way teach students based the fact that some students may not good with asking the treacher questions they may not good with speaking out they don understand the lesson this way they won have and the computers tool help them stay interested the lesson and also move foward the next now some people may thinking that this won work and that how not everyone shows there emotions the same and yes even though that correct the scientist made sure have variety emotions even including the mixed ones such the painting the mona lisa using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements real face the painted face mona lisa weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions vinci masterpiece the fact that vinci studied human anatomy makes easier for the scientists such huang collect data and use the emotions they have based the painting this man painted his new computer software stores similar anatomical information electronic code this also good way talk about the fact that people can even most the time read emotions based what you friend doing the face that they making not only are all these emotions universal but these emotions were also tested the way the face muscles humans bodies change when different emotions occurs meanwhile muscles called orbicularis cuil pars palabras make crow feet haroun your eyes but false smile the mouth stretched sideways using the zygomatic marjoe and different muscle the pistorius expert faces dont lie these muscle clues are sometimes used spot when smiling politican celebrity isn being truthful using computers help teach students goos idea people frown papon technology lot but some cases such this one people are only trying make the lives the future society become easier then and better then would been without technology this will later help improve society and become better with all the things our daily lives,501,0.0239520958083832,4
when was the last time you drove car studies have shown that the amount that people have driven over the last couple years has gone down there are lots advantages limiting car usage some them include less gas emmissions emptier and safer streets and new innovations compensate for the reduction car usage plenty cities around the world have attempted limiting car usage start off citizens limit their car usage there would less gas emissions but unfortunately there are still plenty greenhouse gas emissions transportation the second largest source america emissions just behind power plants there are other options instead driving you could skate bike walk etc the gas emissions are huge problem today society and have change something about the way live for example bogota columbia they have car free day once year this reduces the smog that kept the air from the gas emissions continuing citizens limit their car usage would have safer streets for sure with less cars driving and down the street kids can feel free play the street without having worry about reckless driver coming down and mowing them all down even suburban planners the are trying create car reduced communities instead using cars public transportation becoming the new thing lastly with people not using cars get everywhere some innovations would made side walks would reconstructed less rush hour traffic new restaurants and shopping districts within walking distance and parks and sport centers would blossom bogota all those have blossomed since they have started back the mid with the end car culture also new innovations have spring close out cars are being used less and less and they should because they cause gas emissions unsafe streets and bad construction but are slowly moving away from that culture and who knows what into,404,0.0049504950495049,3
the challenge exploring venus the author uses many details suggest how venus important explore even though the risks are extremely high the first example how the author proves that venus worth exploring paragraph the author states the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans study venus nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray the author uses this quote from nasa the article show how even though they know its extremly risky people are still trying find solutions rather than leaving the problem the second example paragraph nasa working other approaches studying venus for example some simplified electronics made silicon carbide has been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for weeks such conditions this example shows how the scientists are curious venus that they simulating the harsh conditions make strong technology survive venus the third example paragraph the author states striving meet the challenges presented venus has value not only because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors the author uses this example summarize that take the time and make the technology explore venus then good things could come out the solutions conclusion the author uses all these examples and more greatly explain why exploring venus even though scientists are very aware the many dangers such good idea invest time into,317,0.0031545741324921,3
the idea driverless cars amazing idea that would bring alot postive and negative factors believe that the positive out weights the negative factors alot aspects the three main reasons believe this because would safer its something that can taken advantage soon and their are only few laws that need discussed order for this happen the first factor that will attribute the fact that would make driving alot safer the reason behind that because the number one cause behind crashes and accidents texting and driving driverless car would completely eliminate that you could your phone taking important call just scrolling social media the sad thing that most people behind the wheel not take being your phone and driving big deal someone control their own car gets important call they more than likely will take which increases the chances accident that one reason believe that smart cars would positive thing will make driving alot safer the second reason that this something that could affect very soon and what think scares most states the fact that something like this could our streets within four years crazy the article states mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have cars that drive themselves some the major car dealerships are already working towards this idea smart car this something that can and will applied very soon that the second reason think smart cars good idea because this something that can affect soon the third and last reason believe smart cars great idea because will only take minor laws added taken for smart cars the road that amazing thing that there are only couple laws and things discussed for this happen one those things stated the article the issue who will falt the technology fails the smart car and someone injured that one the minor issues that need discusses but still thats something that can resolved that the last reason believe smart cars positive thing only has few minor things settled legally smart cars amazing idea and invention will bring whole new way driving and getting places that will improve society again the reasons are because they will prevent texting and driving can our streets soon and can have issues resolved easily salute whole new generation driving,532,0.0093984962406015,4

unmasking the face mars were scientist nasa discussing the face with someone who thinks the face was created aliens would prove them wrong because there are many objects that have some sort illusion them this story tells how the face just simple landform which believe natural landform because when astronauts were circling around the planet they found simple landform seeing new things that look just like human things can just illusion our eyes for example the red planet could have had the face carved into think that there are objects that can always fool our minds especially planets there are certain planets that give many illusions and just want and figure out why they make have such illusion towards unimportant things the image the face that was spotted mars first appeared jpl web site which means that the image was first taken nasa believe that aliens not exist still and there could have been way that the face was created one them neil armstrong was the first astronaut ever the moon and when came back from the moon left his steps the moon the face could have been created someone who has visited mars red planet even though the planet almost the same temperature the sun they could have taken pocket knife and began crave human face the face was spotted mars but the certain place that was spotted was lava dome what lava dome you may ask well lava dome place that isolated from mesa and can the same height the face mars there are still some scientist that believe that the face was something that aliens created when could been person even people that wanted leave trace left behind maybe they left trace left behind because there probably wasn anybody who has been there before the face was spotted nasa and when nasa spotted the face they made sure zoom what looked like face believe that the face was carved traced behind due human being there even though they say aliens live mars there could way that alien did certain thing aliens could not have been the ones who left the illusion face because some studies show that aliens were not existing that time the story also does not state anything towards aliens being certain planet especially mars conclusion believe that things you leave planet can not always something alien did has done our mind has such great technique play with our minds especially see things from above like the face was seen from above believe the face was just natural landform believe was just natural landform because there are some things planets that have such and illusion into them,595,0.0084033613445378,4

you car may mean more than just getting from point point cars play much bigger impact than may seem they affect not only the person driving but the people around they also have negative impact the greenhouse gases riding bicycle work one day won just good for you will also good for the enviroment around you cars have become universal item lot people have them but really gives them much thought there are few places that have spent the time and really developed ways keep community clean without the hazardous fumes coming from the car exhaust for example vauban germany has developed system where cars are banned the only place you can keep your car the outskirts town designated garages due this most people dont even have car and have chosen sell before moving bogota columbia they had developed day free cars where anyone that drove car would have pay fine according the governer was amazing thing and everyone was participating this also helped get some the nasty gases that they produce away cars give hazardous gases threw their exhaust these gases will rise and get caught the ozone which impacts the enviroment greatly more ways than one can cause the air your breathing toxic also one the main reasons for global warming paris learned this the hard when they reached record level pollution they decided they had choice but ban half the cars one day and ban the other half the next day after this the congestion was down proving that has helped greatly just imagine one day instead driving you could ride bike and help change the enviroment places have tried develop ways reduce the levels gases some have been very succesful for example bogota and vauban they have found creative ways help the question whether not cars should done with all together that have say cars play big part getting work time traveling taking cars away would mean taking away family trips and other fun things with cars the real answer the question that cars should not become much necessity there should ways for people get around better without the use cars now what that might the future has yet tell,507,0.0019723865877712,4

driverless cars becoming part the not too distant future experts have said that they are still developing this technology and they are not completely driverless feel that they may never completely driverless they just don have the right technology make this idea work believe that this bad idea because not safe pointless and there would relaxation the driverless cars may seem like good idea others but the manufactures can not sure that the car won have serious problems when driving itself would not want car that could drive itself interstate and then suddenly stop working and cause severe car crash understand that they are atwill developing this technology and that they are still testing these vehicles but also think they should keep them away from public roads until they develop the technology they need these cars are not quite ready have passengers they may one day the great thing everyone imagined but are not there yet not only are these cars unsafe but they are really pointless you bought driverless car thinking you would never have drive least think that the car would drive itself most the time you would mistaken there point calling car driverless isn the price these cars would most likely extremely high you would sadly disappointed you spent alot money for car that says can drive itself when really you still have drive certain situations most people would think that they could let the car take control and that the passenger could just sit back and relax unfortunately you can the car still requires you aware your surroundings and have least one hand the wheel you may ask how can they tell you are following these rules the answer that question that they would have camera that would able detect you are paying attention not they would also have sensory triggers your steering wheel that lets them know you have your hands the wheel you were driving for long time and you wanted break for little while then the car could take over but you aren really getting break because you still have pay attention case something were happen driverless cars may one day gigantic break through for industry and technology until that day comes when they can completely drive themselves thought needing passengers assistance there really point buying them the saftey pointlessness and lack relaxation makes these cars unprepared for passengers and being out the open road they still lack many aspects that must met before they are ready for use,544,0.0055147058823529,3

dont know what think about car that drives its self its crazy think how far technology has came today some all this new technology stuff good and some bad think that the phone watches computers and stuff like that good but car that drives its self think dumb one reason that think car that drives its self dumb because you never know when the computer that running that car gon na crash and that computer crashes could make that vehicle turn really hard one way slam the breaks punch the gas anthing like that would happen could seriously injury kill anyone the car even people that are not the car think that the engineers that are building these ordinary cars are probably really really smart but still dont like the idea car driving its self drive gmc sierra and love still ran computer and the computer could mess but its not going effect breaks tearing wheel becuase they are not ran computer they are ran and trust that not think that would safe have car the drove its self miles per hour down the interstate but you are sittin really slow traffic might not bad friends moms car has button that you push and the car will parrella park for you one day when she had just got friend his mom and were town and wanted see the parella park thing works and when stared driving its self kind got out into the road and semi almost hit she would have park her self then the semi probably would not have been that closer dont like cars that drive themselves think companys start advertising these cars and lot peole start buy them think that they will not like them and want back car that they are full control also owned car manufactory would want create and sell car that drives itself you create car that drives itself and customer buys one these cars and its driving itself and they are wreck and was the car that drives itself fault then that customer going sew like tomorrow you court anf loose the case depending how much you have pay them your probably gon na end buying them new car the companys have this lot then they are gon na quit making the cars which think will happen sure one day after all these cars will come out but can promises you that any family will ever have one believe things that control think that the companys should try make one and make money they that would great for them crazy think how far the technology had came today and its pretty cool see all being make pretty basic kid will stick the basic things like car that does not drive its self,658,0.0167173252279635,3
new program the facial action coding system recognizes facial emotions can show the different emotions person face the different muscles they using prof thomas huang facial recognition technology valuable for classroom would show whether not student enjoying the lesson and adjust lessons the liking the student first the program could understand humans better fit our needs the article says most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication notes huang computers need understand that too this telling how computers need better understand how humans work the different ways convey emotions and thought also needs know the different variants human emotion the article states weighing the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions each expression compared against neutral face this explains how the program wouldn show regular happy emotion and compare human but instead start with emotion and see which muscles are used find the emotion for example the article states she precent happy percent disgust percent fearful and percent angry that the emotion vinicio painting mona lisa the software states exactly what her emotions are not just one emotion then the program could act like teacher and fix lessons better the student the article says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this shows that huang believes that his technology could the future rearrange lessons and work them for the student better when working computers the article then states for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different the technology would personalize the computer fit the user better making beneficial for student the software helps identify different emotions humans including the mona lisa can show different varieties human emotions and then find someone enjoying what they seeing online this helps students the program recognizing how they feeling about lessons then adjusting them fit their needs the program would really make big difference for online teaching,492,0.0142276422764227,4

think that the idea driverless cars awful idea because none the cars developed far are completely driverless this ruins the whole point taking away human error and letting something else drive you plus think that the transition between the car driving and the driver driving would cause more crashes could also foresee unprepared drivers try use these new driverless cars overall driverless cars seem waste time and money because they would bore the driver and cause more accidents first all think that driverless cars are waste time and money because you still need driver pay attention for this would just ruin the whole experience not having drive even werner huber from bmw agreed that drivers would get bored when admitted that the psychological aspects automation are really challenge this was response the question wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive secondly think that not having focus the road will lead the driver lose focus that when they are called upon drive they are not ready the transition from the car driving the human driving would likely lead more wrecks because when you are not focusing driving you don really care about focusing the road driverless cars seem present the same distraction that texting has and texting while driving illegal most states also know that some people not drive because they are not very good and the idea driverless car might tempt them drive one these same unprepared drivers would still have take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues they were driving google car which would lead yet again more accidents driverless cars are big hoax they are not even truly driverless because they still alert the driver take over this would just boring waiting for your turn drive these would also cause more accidents with the rough transition taking over the wheel especially when unprepared drivers try use this new technology don think that anyone wants worse drivers the road more accidents more expensive cars and even more boring experience with the new and not impressive driverless cars,469,0.0042643923240938,4

dear senator recently there has been much debate about whether the electoral college should retained not after reading the articles very clear that the electoral college has worked efficiently for many years and therefore should kept way voting for our country president first all even though dispute over the outcome electoral college quite possible much less likely than dispute over the popular vote imagine argument broke out about the outcome popular voting there would absolute chaos and too many different opinions even though many voters would argue that they prefer direct voting the product that would only overcomplicated the system and make things run less smoothly secondly the electoral college should kept because restores the weight the political balance that the bigger states lose the virtues the mal apportionment the senate that was decreed the supreme law our country the constitution also makes tie highly unlikely lastly the system the electoral college helps avoid the problem run off elections there lot pressure for elections which candidate gets majority the votes cast were not for the electoral college that pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process the electoral college reduces the risk run off election and produces obvious winner according article three since almost all states award the electoral votes winner takes all basis even the smallest plurality single state can create landslide electoral vote victory that state each party selects slate electors trusted vote for tht party nominee and that trust hardly ever betrayed some people argue that the electoral college unfair because because possible that the winner the electoral vote may not win the national popular vote although that true and possible also incredibly rare happened once the election betweeen bush and gore but that was the first time since all all believe the electoral college has proven consistently successful the history our country after all has given great presidents and hopefully will continue the future elections come,442,0.004524886877828,3

the development for these cars would not worth when sergey brin envisioned the driverless car transportation around the world would change dramatically the driverless cars even work the development for these cars are terrible for the world some reasons that the driverless car would not worth the money make include safety why need driver and fault for the accidents the text states why would anyone want driverless car that still needs driver wouldn drivers get bored waiting for their turn drive this text states that drivers would not want just sit the driver seat while the car driving for them this also states that the driverless car can not safe without driver hand another reason why driverless cars would not good would presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all times this text concludes that driverless cars are not safe all because needs human driver all times this also states that safety big concern for these driverless cars and most states test driving computer driven cars illegal another reason why driverless cars are terrible would they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating though work zones and around accidents this text reveals that the driverless cars can useful until not what the whole purpose driverless car the car still needs human drive the driverless car pointless when the car called driverless car yet can not things itself and needs human who can just drive the car themselves finally the last reason for driverless cars being bad idea would still even traffic laws change new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer this text shows that even the world changes driverless cars new laws would have produced also shows questions regarding when and the driverless car gets into accident who blame the person the car the car the people who make the car reasons against the development these cars are what are the use driver license people will not get drive the safety issues the driverless cars and having the car only watch the road one going need get driver license the driverless cars are coming because the people will not need know how drive the safety issues the driverless cars are questionable because the humans the car can not control what happens with the car people will not enjoy sitting the car watch out for roadblocks the road because the people would get tired the driverless cars would cause tons problems when the driverless car gets into accident who blame for these reasons should make people believe that they should not the person blame because was not their fault the human driver did not create faulty product the conclusion driverless cars are waste money since will still need human help drive,666,0.0,4

venus place that all scientists these days are completely interested the reason why they are into venus because first off how venus called our sister planet which means that venus has some similar living conditions earth does for example venus was originally filled with mostly oceans that could supported various forms life just like earth the planet according the article used still has familiar features such valleys mountains and even living moving creatures which makes venus sound like was originally earth but you wong there because venus has extreme weather conditions such temperature getting degrees fahrenheit the atmospheric pressure times more greater than what experience earth this story venus interesting planet that scientists have been studying for generations generations with the information gave from the article above would baffle any person the world claim that about tell you will support the author this article idea that should look more into venus for example the information gave above the intro are some reasons why should look into more another reason why scientists should look venus more because even though had all those similar living conditions earth has there some drastic conditions that still make non livable some things that make difference venus weather conditions temperature average degrees fahrenheit another because the air pressure would the same amount earths ocean are which not livable all and another example that venus has extreme thunder lightning and rainstorms which frequently hit the ground and would cause lot fires final thoughts this topic should study venus because even though the thing going give example not the article should study venus lot more because venus used still does have some the same living conditions but when the planet has storms has other negative issues the planet venus can get extremely violent naturally and their weather conditions compared ours earth are drastic and make our hurricanes other form storm that think terrible and powerful which they are will make and earth feel incredibly weak,459,0.008714596949891,2

driverless cars are innovative creation that are slowly entering the world their creators are working hard improve them that their passengers can comfortable but more importantly safe big companies like google general motors bmw and tesla are looking into the science driverless cars they are finding new functions driverless cars that normal cars don offer this new technology could huge step forward for mankind the science world opinion driverless cars are great idea that can provide many benefits for its users one reason that engineers are interested driverless cars because they could better the entire transportation system the world sergey brin says sees future where self driven cars provide taxi system and one has own their own car these taxis would provide the passengers with more freedom than bus train would and they would use less than half the fuel that taxis today use course this just what brin envisions but the sooner engineers work towards that goal the sooner will achieved scientists and engineers are adding more sensors cars imitate human driver sensors have provided more safety for drivers since the sensors can apply brakes individual wheels and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than human driver could manage alone already see technology being created that can control car better than humans can ultimately providing more safety also these sensors could prevent accidents such braking the car before hitting pedestrian that the driver didn see sensors provide sort cushion fall back the case that driver becomes distracted bmw created car that can many tasks itself letting the driver relax many people fear that the cars could get out control but with the traffic jam assistant that bmw created drivers can still take control the car when the car realizes that there are difficult conditions ahead notifies the driver let them take over providing the utmost safety some car companies are working creat car entertainment that would instantly turn off when the driver needs take over this feature better alternative texting calling someone phone and could actually provide more safety well being source entertainment driverless cars are also beneficial the fact that they could eventually provide transportation for people with disabilities for example blind people can not drive which many see struggle for day day life with driverless cars blind passengers wouldn have drive and therefore could have more freedom with traveling the same idea applies those with other impairments such broken limb mental illness driverless cars are far from being ready for the average personne use daily life but they are slowly getting there the overall concern for manufacturers are the safety their passengers times come driverless cars could actually provide more safety than human driven cars not only that but they could also make transportation for all people less task,615,0.0032520325203252,4
everyday technology changing for the better there lot controversy about cars whether they should driverless not belive that not good idea for the cars driverless think this becuase humans are smarter technology fails sometimes and will too expensive the idea cars being driverless scary firstly believe that humans are smarter than any computer the world humans know what going whereas computers dont know much computers can fail sense something and get bad accidents drivers also have better senses computer can always fail belive that humans should the only ones driving the cars another reason that think cars should not driverless becuase technology always fails what one the sensors fail and you loose control the car the article said that the cars arn fully driverless what the point also computers can glitch and cause horrible accidents technolgy not very reliable lastly another reason why cars shouldn driverless becuase would cost lot money cars will have many sensors and devises that are very expensive the roads will also need have some seniors them and that will cost fortune the cars will also need lot energy keep all the sensors running which will mean that the battery will need changed constantly and battery arn very cheap belive that will cost much money make the driverless car conclusion belive that driverless cars shouldn made driverless cars will cost toom much humans are smarter and technology not reliable driverless cars will cause alot debt and accidents pointless make them the driver will always need there taking the wheel the cars are not completely driverless driverless cars are not good idea,375,0.0213333333333333,3

opinion driverless cars are good idea having driverless cars can help many ways including preventing crashes and increased safety however driverless cars can also hinder because technology can always fail which could have catastrophic consequences firstly numerous crashes can prevented general motors once created concept car that ran track therefore creating smarter roads instead smarter drivers the only forseeable problem with this that would extremely expensive redo all the roads the country another way that crashes can prevented improved sensors google modified toyota prius with many new sensors the most important being spinning sensor the roof that scans the surrounding area see the road conditions this scanner can inform you car coming you way fast and inform you you need speed slow down can have the car for you both these are adequate reasons standardize driverless cars another reason that driverless cars are good idea that they improve people safety previously mentioned the improved sensors will increase safety there are all kinds sensors that sense all different things such the sensor position estimating sensors gps recieve and many more all these sensors can tell you you close the edge the road you have claar your blindspot you driving fast slow the road conditions and many other things all these sensors are helpful informing your car upon what keep you and your family safe also driverless cars take away distracted driving recently friend mine recieved text picked his phone reply and ran over trash can imagine that trash can had been child car containing you and your children had driverless car then would not have hit that trash can fact would never run over anything again having driverless cars would increase the safety factor for everyone the other hand having driverless cars could bad thing technology could fail leaving catastrophic mess its wake the gps system could misjudge distance causing the car turn soon and run headlong into building killing people inside another thing that the self driving system could fail all together leaving someone who doesn know how drive leiter stranded having drive themselves therefore driverless cars could bad thing essence driverless cars can both good and bad for mankind they can reduce the liklihood crashing and increase safety but the technology can fail and harm many people,543,0.012891344383057,4

the use this technology called the facial action coding system not valuable read students emotional expressions not all expressions students face can readable some students may have natural expressions but show differently how accurate are these calculations for these expressions really the article states eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness but what about emotions that further and can shown thought basic expression more emotions are linked the basic emotions person have guilt but show face anger but actually they are sad and cover the facial action coding system just reads the expressions but not feelings the students some students have natural expressions have friends that have natural mean mug but are reality happy just calm this system could get confused with angry face the article states the facial expressions for each emotion are universal meaning there wide range emotions but could this system actually detect the difference between two similar faces person that makes the same face alot the article also states for example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you surprised your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips show anger for the students who have natural facial structure will most likely harder detect their actual emotion the article starts off saying shes percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry although the system recognizes these expressions they are not actually reading her thoughts they not actually know the feelings mona lisa and just are basing off her expression this article also states each expression compared against neutral face showing emotion but how accurate this persons face against others they could showing emotions also conclusion this why the system should not value read people expressions doesnt have wide enough range for each person the system bases off others neutral faces people structures are different from one another and have different meanings the system does not give you actual feelings and just read faces,448,0.0022321428571428,4

the following essay analysis the article the challenge exploring venus and evaluation the points that the article brings the article describes dangers visting our neighbour planet venus and ideas how could done the author does great job describe venus the earth twin but also dangerous planet that not made for brings that spacecraft has survived landing for more than few hours that the atmosphere carbon dioxide that there are clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid that the plantes surface has average temperature degrees fahrenheit and that the atmospheric pressure times greater the earth all these points convinced that venus planet that not made for even brings points why should still there seems like would make common sense says that venus once looked just like the earth but for doesn matter how once looked like because then would first into time traveling and that not what this article about the author also brings that there could survivable solution having blimp like vehicle hovering miles above the landscape don think that this good idea because would take much work and money just see things that can see without human being there mentions that probably wouldn even help the scientists that much because wouldn able take samples anything even inspect the ground conditions think that idea waste money and unless there really good reason something specific look for shouldn the author then mentions that researchers are looking for innovations that would allow our machines last long enough contribute knowledge over venus think that good think but can not option send human there because long you only send machines just money that you send there but with all the dangers stupid send human venus closes his article with the statement that have strive for new knowlege beyond our earth and agree with that but have look out what the dangers are and sometimes things are not possible because are very limited compared the power the universe think that should keep looking for new innovations that can help explore the universe but have accept that are very small big universe and that not everything possible for because are limited while the universe not,534,0.0112359550561797,4
believe that there are some ups and some downs the development making these computerized cars because like the article sayf there was accident then whose fault would the article also says that why would anyone want driverless car but they still have drive this makes sense because you have driverless car then you shouldn have still drive having driverless car should mean that matter what all you should have sit the the car and just driven where that you want even though the assist very helpful having driverless car little much seems though you would have put more time into worrying about your going have drive now the next five minutes that lot stress having driverless car would use more fuel than just calling taxi cab doesn make sense that the drive should have drive half the way and then the car just takes over there are some perks having car that can drive itself but then again say you just got off work your tired yes you can let the car drive but what the car doesn want drive anymore then you have come out your comfortable spot and drive this not right should just keep the cars that have now seems like they are lot less trouble and they get you where you need the time that you need there there was really point making the driverless car you still have everything that you have when your just driving yourself driverless cars are very dangerous because you don know when you might get into accident and then you have car driving you you never know when the car parts might stop working and doesn tell you that you have roadblock ahead that you may have come sudden stop the idea having driverless car good idea even you though you may have everything that you would have you are driving the car believe that having driverless car very dangerous not always going reliable and you can hurt yourself with this car assist can stop working may give you one day the down fall about having selfarchiving car too that matter you have accident not still may become said your fault,521,0.0076775431861804,3

there are many reasons why reducing the need for transportation car would help solve many problems cars cause many major environmental issues cars also cause many health issues seeing that they encourage motorized transportation instead the human body own two legged system getting from point poit many authors have wrote about cases where some places the world are trying see how becoming car free zone would help the economical environmental and health related issues caused vehicles such cars elizabeth rosenthal explains that german experiment already happening where the country have created city where there are little vehicles driving down the roads without punishment the passage recently read rosenthal titled german suburb life goes without cars she talks about how vauban germany residents are playing the most important role experimental project that prohibits things like street parking driveways and home garages the district has also moved nesser places grocery stores etc lot closer home order make them within walking distances peoples houses this done way essentially eliminate the use vehicles get from place place one man heidrun walter says when had car was always tense much happier this way one many participants this experiment who shows that terminating vehicle use countries will possibly make lot people happier and will also cause the air around nearly free pollutes and toxins that possibly inhale daily basis suggested paragraph rosenthal passage benefits from car bans are also discussed robert duffer passage called paris bans driving due smog paragraph this passage states the smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party rescind the ban meaning that the amount polluted air the effected countries and cities went down controllable amount after the ban had taken place therefore this passage even more evidence that cars being eliminated from public use very good thing for the environment eliminating least cutting back motorized transportation would definately help lot damaged areas the world,449,0.0089086859688195,3

venus sometimes called evening star according the author since one the brightest points light the night sky like the stars the sky when they shine bright through out the clouds the sky but the nickname misleading becuase venus actually planet venus actually the second planet from our sun the sun safe see from distance for example during the solar eclipse safe not look well venus seen from distance but safe vantage point earth venus very challenging place examine from close distance but with the correct utensils supplies and technology could possible right venus often referred earth twin since venus occasionally the closest distance earth mars another planet that also known another neighbor which orbits the sun different speed what the differences speed you may ask well means that sometimes when are closer mars and other times venus venus challenging place examine close but the author says venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents meaning that there beauty found upon must discover venus sometimes found right around the corner space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft land the cloud draped world spacecraft has survived the landing for more than few hours each previous mission that was unmanned and for good reasons more than three decades not single spaceship has touched down venus which explains why venus reputation the challenging planet for humans study now though there are forms which have possibility discover amazing features thanks nasa known the national aeronautics and space administration the temperatures are average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater that what experienced our own planet scientists are currently discussing furthur visits its surface astronomers are impressed how its earth like planet our solor system which motivates them more wanting and discovering new things that has never been found out thier initial thoughts that venus was long ago probably covered largely with the oceans and could have supported various forms life just like our earth venus has various similiar features our earth like valleys mountains and craters venus basically the nearest option for planetary visit there are options that could make the mission both safe and scientifically productive according nasa they have had one particularly idea for sending humans study venus nasa condition could make possible solution for the surface venus which would allow scientists float above the fray technology has become big importance becuase with technology can help many forms and nasa has come with idea that could make possible for humans and travel blimp like vehicle that would hover miles above the roiling venusian landscape just like the jet airplanes that travel higher altitude that can fly over many storms with this vehicle can avoid the unfriendly ground conditions staying off another thing the solar power which would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels overall there are ways which can discover venus safety form and find information technology big thing becuase nasa always finds ways which build special technology its safe for the humans explore safely adn they can enjoy the subject they enjoy which would the spacecraft although spacecraft has its dangers and risks also beautiful thing into becuase the beauty you discover nasa still working other approaches studying venus and they can that nasa simplifying electronics made silicon carbide have been tested them chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and lasted for three weeks mechanical computers were old technology used back then which were first envisioned the and played important role during the world war which shocking think they had that type technology back then but useful with the humans curiosity will most likely lead into many intimidating endeavors which will travel and discover alot more imagination and innovation will meet our expanded edges meet furthur discoveries will discover and spread and let the people know the hidden beauty hiding behind closed doors,813,0.019680196801968,4

feel that keeping the electoral college the wrong way that changing election popular vote better decision because the people our nation should able choose who they want the president not the electors why not have the whole nation vote for who they want and who ever has the majority the votes win that sounds like fair election the electoral college has many faults that just one little tiny mishap can cause huge disaster within the election the electoral college does have some advantages like swing states avoiding run off elections but also has disadvantages for example takes many risks its unfair voters its outdated and irrational the electoral college cheats the people who are voting mean they didn sign vote for the electors they did for the president why not give them that chance makes easier other people and the election fair one the picking and choosing the electors unorganized each year its different person sometimes state conventions sometimes the states party central committee and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves voters that and vote for which ever president they want really aren even voting for the president their voting for that president elector which someone who goes and votes for that president that picked them their elector and sometimes the voter that actually voting for the elector vote for their assigned president will end voting for different president also voters will sometimes get confused about all these electors and vote for the wrong candidate conclusion changing from electoral college would the best choice make because election popular vote for the president isn complicated more reliable isn risky and most importantly the voters get fair election,371,0.0026954177897574,3

personal opinion driverless cars are not the best idea scientists have ever discovered feel like driverless cars would very dangerous way for people get from place place also feel like there would more bad aspects then good this subject the other hand they would very useful and convenient opinion think that driverless cars could very dangerous invention they were not tested enough varius ways for example what there was situation were someone was driving down that road and their car disfunction something electronically happens within the engine not only would the driver danger but all the other cars around the smart car could too paragraph four the option smart roads was discussed think would safer try inventing roads that help the car before inventing car and expecting all the work itself the bad things far outweigh the good things when that idea smart cars get brought smart cars need lot electronical materials not need driver anymore that huge risk anyone would taking when stepping foot into smart car any moment time the electronical systems could crash the smart car was need internet and something happens the web another aspect this discussion would the law you being the driver smart car got into accident and was not your fault you are not going want pay for the damage many laws would have changed order for ordinary people able drive smart cars the roads huge discussion weighing the bad things and good things with the subject smart cars the other hand smart cars would very convent paragraph two they discuss that today day age have all the technology allow smart cars manufactured all different types products are being manufactured with new technology everyday why not manufactory smart car buying smart car would great for older people that can not get out and drive themselves but still wouldn help very much this reasoning that the elderly person still might have drive little bit something was happen and they run into construction site accidents may even more dangerous for the older person have switch back and forth from the car being driven for them them having operate the vehicle again opinion think smart cars are bad invention unless scientists were invent road systems that matched specifically car there many risks taking this point time the progression smart cars possibily the future when scientists discover more about them they might better and more reliable,560,0.0125,4
begin with that reducing advantages limiting car usages can help reduce the percent greenhouse gas emissions europe and reduce percent the gas areas like the united states must lessen the space for parking instead stores along distant highway you can actually just walk the store percent appropriations have law gone highways and only percent other transport have try harder make the united states more like vauban then need get rid cars help get rid pollution cars also causes smog which can get rid reduced the usage cars also many cars causes congestion and lost revenue delivery companies good idea would fine the people like paris did reduce many cars the street next the goal would promote alternative transportation and reduce smog only buses and taxis would permitted for the time being without any cars roaming the streets also any violates will faced dollar fine this idea would really good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution could also build bicycle paths help travel could also have restrictions which could dramatically cut traffic finally got rid cars would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment new york new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities said that young people decreased percent between and proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry create cities which public transportation traffic are woven into connected network save time conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety,335,0.0029850746268656,3

dear senator what the first thing that comes your mind when you think the presidential elections you think about the complicated electoral college the popular vote average citizen who not politics immediately think the popular vote when comes the presidential elections why have the electoral college anyways shouldn the people able decide who the president not the state legislature therefore instead the electoral college should just stick the popular vote american you have certain unalienable rights and the act voting one them its our right vote than should able not other people the electoral college isnt that safe either stated the text when president kennedy ran for office segregationist the state louisiana nearly succeeded replacing the democratic voters elected the people with voters who would have voted against kennedy when gore won the popular vote but george busch won the electoral vote and caused the biggest election scandal the century these are just few examples instances where the majority has won but the electoral college has caused issue the election unsure your preferences over popular electoral but who the majority the american people decide should become the president shouldn allow some politicians out some million citizens choose the president the american people should choose all not though our founding fathers decided that needed system decide the president instead letting the people decide times have changed scandals have taken place and issues have risen but yet still use this process even though have election all does elect select few represent why cant just pick right away the constitution the united states america based off democracy where the people run the government through our elected officials nowhere does say that elect people elect the president that doesnt sound like the country electing the president sounds like few qualified people electing the president senator ask you that you make motion eliminate the electoral college all does take away our rights citizens elect our officials has caused many scandals well please hope you can agree that need eliminate the electoral college and only use the popular vote,483,0.0062111801242236,4
everybody wants privacy sometimes good thing leave person alone whether she feeling sad happy angry using this facial action coding system read the emotional expressions students not valuable there might come time when person sad because she has lost loved one that person probably would not want anyone knowing how she feeling the moment computer used understand his her emotions could cause that person more upset sad the computer could acknowledge emotional expressions but still has yet learn how respond situation where that person needs help paragraph six the author states that computer can know whether you feeling happy sad confused bored school when student needs help the person can just raise his her hand get help from the teacher computer will most likely use complicated words modify the lesson the problem the new technology can read emotions but can not really understand the person much human being can most the paragraphs this article paragraph eight for example the author describes about how the computer looks facial expression understand someone emotion school there are shy kids who are afraid ask for help normally those shy kids are smart students who get good grades true that one can not just assume all shy kids are smart but this case more likely that shy student will ask help from teacher who can understand him her little bit better than computer that can just read facial expressions this technology could also end friendships relationships paragraph seven and eight the author mentioned that the computer can recognize the difference between genuine smile and forced one this would mean that there way hide your emotions for example two friends get argument because one person was jealous the other one most cases that jealous person could have hidden his her emotions but with the new technology the other person will know sometimes good thing able hide emotions and feelings from other people using technology that can read students emotional expressions not good idea for one most likely computer will not better job teaching students than human teacher also computer can not show empathy someone who going through tough time last but not least this technology programmed helpful could unintentionally end friendships relationships computers may useful many cases but they can never really much humans,540,0.0,4

dear senator have come conclusion how think the president and his candidates should voted for one hand got the electoral college and the election popular vote these two thing have been around for hundreds years but you got know you prefer one the other which one works better why you prefer this one over the other the electoral college electors meeting and voting for our president and vice president this electoral college consist electors that vote for our president myself dont think this very sensible thing because when you think you voting for the president you are actually voting for state electors who will turn vote for the president not you why should there select few people out the billions people who live america vote for the president while just sit and wait for the results only have their opinions voiced does seem like very fair way elect someone who will changing our country this winner take all system election popular vote this means you and will voting for the president and his cabinet ourselves that will have say who want change even fix our country although the person vote for may not win still got say what believe would have made our county better place although the electoral college might give more clear winner know that our vote will actually have effect the election might pay more attention the election and vote more wisely knowing that have voiced our preference rather than knowing maybe one single electoral vote might have set the election now there are some benefits the electoral college the case having precise vote who gets president one also maybe the fact that you voted the people who will electing the president way just the same however this does notman that better than you just voting yourself because those are layabout the two thing that are evn remotely good about the electoral college when you decide who you want president think how you would like your vote heard through your own vote maybe possibly through anothers vote know which system would choose giving that would give more voicing the matter what would you,476,0.0105042016806722,4

dont you think that having driverless cars will cause many problems for instance driverless cars would like schools that dont teach teachers would there but they wouldnt anything but sit there therefore student would learn dont think that good idea have driverless cars one reason dont think that there should driverless cars because would cause problems with the manufacture the car and the owner the car say that because the passage states that manufactures are aslo considering using cameras watch that drivers are remaining focused the road that invasion privacy therefore the company and the manufacture the car can sued and pretty sure that company would want gert sued for having cameras the inside car that watched the driver another reason why feel that there should not driverless cars because cars would longer fun for people have that mean most people like divar they say its fun and gives the something but there was driverless cars they wouldnt get drive they would just sit the car and wait untill the car gets the destination how that fun would only fun there was button switch that the owner could use change the cars settings that when they want drive they can sand when they dont want drive they dont have the last reason dont feel that driverless cars are good idea because there promises yet that there will ever driverless car for example person looking buy car and they car dealership and the person trying sell them car says drives its own and the person buys the car when they get drive they see that only drives its own certain times dont you think that real misleading mean there way that company cant get sued for that say that because the company sold car someone that was suppose drive itself but doesnt drive its own therefore misleading and can cause major problems for the company and those are only some the reasons why feel that there should not driverless cars they will cause many problems with car companies and the owners the cars they will take all the fun out being able drive cars and there promise that the car will completely driverless and company says then could cause companies loose lot money for everyone that thinks they should make car that driverless dont,537,0.0111731843575419,4
believe that there are many advantages limiting car use people should ride bikes more walk places that are near instead driving helps clean the world all the pollution the air walking riding bike instead driving places that are close enough helps prevent the build smog also you save money gas second helps lower pollution that the air and helps lower peoples stress and last helps conserve energy lower emmissions and improve saftey ever necesary use car try car pooling get taxi instead driving yourself passenger cars are responsible for percent the greenhouse gas europe and percent some car intensive areas the united states people who live near stores would use bikes and would walk the store instead driving would help minimize the expansion smog after five days the partial driving ban paris the capital france congestion traffic went down percent the smog rivaled beijing china which known one the most polluted cities the world also advantage for limiting the use cars you save the money you would spend gas you would able spend yourself important things like bills and groceries second helps lower pollution that the air and helps lower peoples stress levels peoples stress levels will come down due the exercise they will doing instead driving for example bogota colombia parks and sports centers have bloomed through out their city also not having worry about they they have enough money for gas will help the stress down last but not least few other advantages are helps conserve energy lower emmissions and improve saftey conserves the fossil fuels that are running out fast due many people driving also helps lower emmissions from the cars that people drive aroud the united states and the world which pollutes the air and then creates smog and helps improve safety haing less car accidents and people being run over cars will help making the death rate accidents down conclusion believe these reasons are why there are advantages limiting car usage walking riding bike instead driving places that are close enough helps prevent the build smog also you save money gas second helps lower pollution that the air and helps lower peoples stress and last helps conserve energy lower emmissions and improve saftey,504,0.0119047619047619,3

scientist nasa and going prove you that nasa was not created aliens just natural landform other scientists including was around mars taking photos took lot photos and when came back check the photos looked like human face used new method step step see actually was human face but was not turned out rock shaped head and the rock made you have illusion the eyes mouth and nose many people are concerned about aliens going attack but not true some scientists just want you think there are aliens that based off what they have saw you look jpl web site you can see that just natural landform after all there was alien monument the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte messa landforms according what the theory another reason for being natural landform because nasa would rather hide and the defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars half the time photos things start look like ghost even aliens for this matter you are scared and are thinking about aliens being alive you the face natural landform according the mission controllers where the lab monitors will lok like face when you first take but you have clear the picture little bit for the face seem natural you you have believe that there aliens out what people call bona fide life mars you always want make sure that you are not just having illusion make sure you are not having illusion you are checking what ever happening twice for example natural landform there would have pictures taken and the natural landform there would have mapping spacecraft and that normally looks straight down for example alien landform there would ufo with bright lights shining and would have have hide out for them live and not seen this evidence that gathered from the method that used prove you that the face just natural landform yes nasa does have mars but that does not mean that there would aliens just because says mars you ever have need some help getting person believe you about something like scientists wise come website jpl and message their are creatures but they are not the face nasa not ever forget you take picture and you think something there try clear get someone else clear,556,0.0,4
the article making mona lisa smile the author makes some very good points why this type technology would useful for people when teaching class isn easy give lesson and focus student faces the same time because eventually you lose your spot the lesson while searching through the sea faces another challenge that teachers face keeping everyone focused this technology very useful teachers because can help them make class less boring paragraph sentence says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this feature would very useful teacher they can change their style teaching best suit the whole class when using this computer teachers can find out who angry upset and can focus their attention those particular students and figure out what the problem paragraph sentence states that weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions said before very hard teach lesson and study people faces the same time when the computer finds out who upset will benefit the teacher very much something inside the classroom that bothering them the teacher can talk the student about whether they confused just don like the way they being taught let say for example the student doesn like the teaching style and the teacher talks them about the teacher then changes what that student doesn like and turn there increase the willingness participate class when comes being confused high school classroom most high school students don want ask for help because they embarrassed what their peers may say they then don know what for school work and assignments and turn they get low grade but with this computer can give the teacher information who having trouble and they can either slow down the lesson help that person individually conclusion these computers are extremely valuable not only the teachers but the students well because can help teachers differentiate who happy sad angry confused bored and the students are happy class they are more willing participate better participation equals better grades not teachers job make everyone happy teach class but some the students are unhappy and effecting their ability learn class than this computer the perfect way help everyone out,557,0.0,4

many people rely their cars that they not think about limiting car usage however liming car usage can have positive effect less car usage can mean less pollution more human interaction and can save people money maybe people should look into the idea car usage limitations when you big city like paris france beijing china you can look and see the smog caused pollution pollution can caused things other than cars like factories paper mills however car pollution big contribute when car usage limited for just one weekend the pollution and smog can decrease incredible numbers may seem like pollution here stay but just half the population reducing car usage can make heavy smog thing the past limited car usage can also cause more human interactions people using public transportation walking the sidewalk can lead people talking and making new friends when waiting for the bus subway you could start conversation with someone new that person could become you new befriend your future husband maybe they could just someone you talk the way work each morning the something can happen when walking the sidewalk your favorite cafe you could accidently run into them and start conversation maybe you happen like the same shows restaurant being your own car alone can cut you off from the world which why car pooling can also good the four people the car are all using one car instead four different cars they talk more this causes more human interactions with everyone car together car pooling can not only cause human interaction but can also save money you not use your car everyday meaning you not use much gas gas very expensive and not paying for often can save hundreds dollars each person that carpooling can switch who does when that not one person paying for all the gas and driving all the time this makes everyone save money which can spent businesses making the economy rise limiting car usage may not seem like such big deal with only little effect but can make huge difference limited car usage can cause less pollution more human interaction and can save people money this might make you rethink how much you use your car and you should limit your usage,480,0.0166666666666666,4

fair both the electoral college and popular vote are good ways decide election although popular vote may have more pitfalls than the latter the electoral college definitely the best way pick candidate without much confusion the electoral college may have some down falls too but the benefits out weigh them popular vote also has some benefits richard posner passage defence the electoral college states the electoral college not democratic method the electors who elect the president not the people source this was our voting method the people would choosing the president not the electors plus the people dont even know the electors their voting for the passage the indefensible electoral college author bradford plumer states the state picks the electors and the voters dont even get pick who the electors vote for source basically the people have control over who they elect indeed there maybe limited control for the people over voting for their canidate but the electors usually pick whoever the people voted for the electoral college also easier way decide who wins the election theres almost way there can tie electoral vote richard posner states the winning candidates share the electoral college invariably exceeds his share the popular vote even the popular vote winner wins little wins all the electoral votes source which means there confusion who wins not only the electoral college more organized but makes the president have appeal many regions people richard posner states not one region has enough votes win election the president has liked other regions well source this means that least half the country must like the candidate for him win swing states are also important the electoral college these states are the ones that really care and study who will the best president another statement from richard posner states people swing states decide the election and are the most thoughtful voters source the candidate must trying make sure they please the people the people may like popular vote the best but the most organized and beneficial way elect candidates through electoral college the electoral college not helps with organizing helps people know the candidate they know the candidate because the candidate must each region and get know the people,517,0.0058027079303675,4

the chance that computers would have the ability fully communicate and understand humans understanding facial expression has both positive and negative effects different situations some people are unable transfer their thoughts into the right words explain how theyre feeling then would positive effect letting people know how communicate with them way that suits their mood there are some people that maybe dont want read and evaluated computer though this where would negative effect because people should have their own privacy and they want look happy but actually sad then thats just them who they are and how they handle their feelings how could evaluation fully understand whats going the inside someones brain anyway dont think peoples privacy should taken from this new technology claim this article would against the new technology read students emotional expression not for just because the article says how their facial expressions are that how theyre feeling when possibly there something completely opposite going their mind,207,0.0096618357487922,2

the subject mona lisa feels percent happy percent disgusted percent fearful and percent angry this conclusion was drawn from new computer software that can recognize emotions while that pretty awesome example what this technology can there the lingering question this technology should used classrooms while could read emotions decide lessons need easier there are more cons this technology than pros therefore this technology not valuable enough used classroom with students because humans have more complex emotions that can explained with six emotions teachers are already classrooms assess these emotions and this technology just not practical enough yet first all the new emotion reading technology can not read enough emotions valuable used classrooms the article stated that the software can only recognize happiness surprise disgust fear and sadness how can software only recognizing six emotions effectively judge student struggling class humans have more complex emotions than what can defined through different percentages just six emotions also struggles bring upon different emotions humans depending how someone takes that struggle some people may feel confused while others will indifferent and just move while this software can even recognize these complex emotions how will effectively assess someone feelings confusion class secondly classrooms are composed teacher and students the teacher there carefully assess the learning the students and adjust the pace the course teachers can read emotions students better than computers because they are human just like the students are humans humans can relate recognize and comprehend other people feelings better than computer software also having difficulties understanding new ideas part the learning process when one does not understand they their teacher for help this helps students learn how form relationships with other people including their teachers computer analyzes how student feels and adjusts the lesson the students will never learn the valuable lesson how face struggles and overcome them with help from other people like teachers lastly this technology not developed enough yet valuable use classroom the article stated that home can not handle the complex algorithms the software home can handle the laptops schools probably can not either would quite costly implicate this software into the educational system making lose its value the high cost not overweighted the outcome not practical enough conclusion the emotion recognizing software not valuable enough used classrooms the software can not recognize complex emotions teachers are already there find these emotions and adjust the lessons and not cost effective implement this technology classrooms while emotion recognizing software great leap forward technology just not valuable enough use classrooms yet,583,0.006861063464837,4
the new techonology called the facial action coding system facs valuable tool for reading students emotions classrooms elsewhere for many reasons since the system detect and into depth persons emotion accurate results will come out there are multiple ways that this system can help teachers determining how student feels these things such knowing the student confused about topic they are bad mood not the facial action coding system would value for these reasons first off this techology can classify the six main human emotions those which are sadness happiness anger disgust fear and being surprised scientists have used the mona lisa picture way help their research you know leonardo vinci painting mona lisa painting that relays many emotion face the picture are not able tell she smiling not she angry not she happy not and etc the system was able detect the emotions the painting used students teachers will know what student feels when student puts undetectable face furthermore the use hightechnology classrooms will benefit how each student can learn the article states for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this will help students who may having more trouble certain subjects classrooms adjusting their learning style that way the student may able understand more about what they are learning the way they think since teachers can not always detect how students feel about their teaching the facs can help and describe their expressions certain lessons that are being taught another reason why this valued source technology for student because can affect the way classroom atmosphere will everyone happy the class will also happy says the article that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them students put happy face then that will affect how they feel same with having sad mad surprised face with this technology since able detect emotions the facial structure students can change their facial structure that may affect their actual emotion this technology can also prove student lying about something certain muscles the face they are stretched can determine person being truthful not expert faces don lie these muscle clues are sometimes used spot when smiling politician celebrity isn being truthful classroom this technology can used help solve problem occuring class and able figure out the truth not only that most human communication nonverbal incuding emotional communication this technology also great way for nonverbal communication between students when they are not able verbally physically communicate overall the facial action coding system great value techonology used determine students emotional expression can help adjust students learning type help better atmosphere and better person emotion may also help student they are not good mood and may need help from friend teacher but not able say but instead show this technology can help lot for students many those ways,751,0.0066577896138482,4
hey earth has twin the challenge exploring venus the author strongly suggest that venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers although the author idea may sound wild some does support his argument very intelligently begin the author supports his ideas giving back ground knowledge venus the author then proceeds scientifically explain the orbits that venus mars and earth under takes earth venus and mars our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun different speeds these differences speed mean that sometimes are closer mars and other times venus because venus sometimes right around the cornering space trumans have sent numerous spacecraft land this cloud draped world the explanation that the author gives shows the smarty the planets and the efforts exploring venus important despite its conditons paragraph the author uses rhetorical device our sister planet hostile why are scientist even discussion further visits its surface the author uses rhetorical question get his point across the reader the author goes further into depth describing the geographics venus and how could been earth like planet long ago today venus still has some features that are analogous those earth the author brings nasa into the conversation and explains how they have been working explore venus nasa possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientist float above the fray although the author fully aware the extreme conditions venus they still don believe that hovering miles from venus wont provide them with enough information the author also argues that scientist wont have the ability take samples rocks gas etc the author even goes further saying therefore scientist seeking conduct thorough mission understand venus would need get close and personal despite the risks well earth may have twin but they are not identical despite the harsh conditions venus the author does great job with supporting their idea that venus worthy pursuit not forget the author supported their claim with lots evidence provided through out the text,432,0.0393518518518518,4

the classroom there are many issues boredom like having boring teacher boring subject well there could possible fix that article called making mona lisa smile nick alto are introduced this concept and idea through the facial action coding system this system program that can read facial expressions and muscles identify emotion person this could help students lot applied right the classroom could help them focus more the topic could help them learn better there own way and could help them get higher grades class many kids have focusing problems because they simply not interested chemistry algebra but what was taught way that did interest them even little this could help the kids find their focus class the facs can read the emotions the kids the class and detect boredom said the article making mona lisa smile and change bit needs online schooling this could prove very useful getting the attention the kids they begin focus more the lesson hand and maybe even begin learn better the article making mona lisa smile the author gives the idea applying the facs technology the ouside world when its development completed the author states many idea about how include the world including the classroom once the attention the class has been caught and they begin pay attention they will actually begin learn something and the dominos begin fall once they begin learn something they understand better and maybe even remember better then they begin better tests and finals and leads better grades and gpa the article explains how the facs technology works more detail than not the software creates verson the faces with muscles and all then determines emotion tracking muscle movement this format determines how the emotional state someone when classrooms begin grasp attention and kids learn you begin see higher scores tests and thus higher grades classes like biology geometry chemistry and algebra this raises gpa and though may seem like long shot could increase college application rates the facs software can prove very useful society most importantly schools with large amounts failing students the article uses the experiment using facs the mona lisa itself and determines lisa percent happy this ability could majorly help the students that need new methods lecturing and homework could increase focus class and the learning rates because and result all could push out higher grades and gpa across the country and help society whole become more interested,568,0.005281690140845,4

what you think made the face the side mars think was naturally made others think that was made aliens think saying was made aliens unreasonable years ago nasa says they found the face mars while they were circling mars with their space drone was short lived suprised because looked like natural structure that formed over time then couple days later nasa let the whole world see nasa even had the littlest idea that aliens then they would not have released the public the face has become pop icon that everyone likes some thim that this pure evidence life mars but nasa budget defenders wish there was because there was life mars then they would get tons money from the discovery extraterrestrial beings mars overall the face decaying over the years there was aliens then don you think they would fix least maybe once twice over the many years that their creation that proves that ali nes didnt make you can also compare naturally made landforms that are common around the western part america there were things that were made but non natural then they would able see all the faults apices you can tell that were not naturally made because how good the graphics are the space drones photos that are token such great quality that you can see all the piles this creation really stood out nasa because they can only see strips amd mostly made out mars dust that surrounds mars they had peer through the wispy clouds just see because how cloudy that side the planet therefor proves that these are natural land forms because there are things that earth that may look like this conclusion think that the face mars was naturally made for alot valid reasons the end the day might not ever know what made the face mars can only have our thoughts and copious who what made the structure,413,0.0314769975786924,3

had facial action coding system every classroom would the students have higher chance succeeding would they get more less help would this gather more attention class would think mostly agree with having facial action coding system classrooms tell how the students are feeling disagree with some aswell the teachers could tell exactly how each student feeling class like bored confused think that they would provide more help those students and there will higher percentage people who pass there clases the passage making mona lisa smile they used the technology the painting mona lisa think that they used the students they would more engaged and ready learn think that the students would find more things being taught them class interesting the passage has example that think would good for the use this software schools for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this were happen know that would lot better feel that many other students would better too when get that like and similar ads pop usually they are watched were class and felt happy not happy with what are learning the teaching style lesson might change something that will keep more students engaged but feel like their are other things that aren good about the software the software was installed every class and you walked feeling very upset for something that maybe happened outside class school you will most likely feel that way the whole time during that class the machine might pick that you are not being interested the topic you wouldn get anywhere now you tell the teacher that you aren happy for whatever reason thats different story but you shy and you don tell people how you feel especially something happened make you feel sad angry etc don think the machine would help much terms education but you are more engaged learning because the software think their will way higher chance for more people graduate you are engaged interested into whatever you learning you will most likely paying attention and taking the information you were class and the software picks that you understand whats being taught more people would focus that class this happens more people would pass tests exams and graduate after you graduate you will have learned all the education that you needed learn college sence more people have the education more people would college had the facial action coding system software classrooms think that more people would have higher chance succeeding getting help paying attention passing tests and exams also think that more people will college think that more people would pay attention interested what they learning and think would easier more students the software were mess think that the teachers would have more problems deal with like getting fixed just simply teach without their are problems with think that this would very helpful tool for teachers and students,751,0.0026631158455392,4

the electoral college the system that our founding fathers had set for choose leader this country has been used forever and some poeple may agree that should keep but others understand that should change the voting system that the election more fair believe that the united states should longer use the electoral college elect our president because feel that should have more direct vote that the person that most people actually want office will elected and that all the states can hear each candidates campaign they feel like their vote actually takes part the election begin with believe that the united states should start use direct vote choose our leader that the winner the popular vote actually gets win and that the peoples votes actually matter seems only fair that you win the popular vote from everyone one the country that you should win the race but with using the electoral college the desiccation will always vary for example during gore bush gore had over the nations vote most the people wanted him our acting president but due the electoral college bush ended winning the election the people actually did have say then gore wouldbe been elected because the popular vote when using the electoral college your vote wouldnt apart the actual election your supposed elect elector vote for you truly your elector has all the power because the end they are the one choosing who your state has voted for furthermore the electoral college shouldn used elect our president because makes unfair voters with the winner take all system each state the candidates dont spend time try and campaign all the states because they think they have chance winning that state every state should able see the campaigns for each the candidates they can have actual choice campaigners spend most their time focused the swing states how would they know they had chance winning over any other state that they thought wouldnt vote for them for example back seventeen states didnt see any the candidates single campaign that basically telling that state that their vote doesnt matter conclusion the electoral college has major flaws that are easily exploited the people dont get vote for themselves instead they put their vote the hands elector who the end has the final say who the state votes for also the electoral college which has winner take all system excludes some the states from actually seeing candidate which makes seem like their vote irrelevant the whole election,543,0.007366482504604,4

dear senator think you should get rid the electoral college and use popular vote instead think this because the electoral college acts one the electoral college also does not give every state chance see who they are voting for and last but not least its just confusing think you should use popular vote instead the electoral college because the electoral college votes whole there not just one person state there are thousands sometimes millions not every single person cast the same vote not every single person has the same views the electoral college was used than votes unanimous vote while there are different political parties within that state another reason the electoral college should not used because does not give evey state fair chance the electoral college does not give every state fair chance because the presidential candidates only visit the states with the larger amounts electoral votes the swing states state doesn have large number votes isn swing state the candidates don visit said source two the smaller states don see the candidates much the larger states because the electoral college makes seem though they can only have little any impact the outcome the presidential race the final reason reason why the electoral college should not use dis because its just confusing the popular vote lot easier understand than the electoral college many people get confused during the election days because they not understand the electoral college when they are voting they think they are voting for the president the electoral college doesn mean that you are voting for the president you want just means that you voting for the people who also want vote for the same president you conclusion senator these are the reasons why think that should use the popular vote instead the electoral college first the electoral college votes whole instead showing the state differences secondly presidental candidates don visit the states with smaller amount electoral votes and lastly the electoral college just confusing,428,0.014018691588785,4

the author suggests that venus would worth while investment thus might bring interesting facts about our sister planet hence nasa and our government will make lot money for bringing crucial information about venus from here there will many facts why exploring venus will worth while investment venus also known the evening star since easy see night and our sister planet very difficult place study the size venus why known our sister planet has almost the same density mass and size earth but the contrast its atmosphere very different from ours the atmosphere the planet has many storms that are highly electrical hence lightning can strike craft out the sky and the atmosphere made carbon dioxide the blankets carbon dioxide make hard see into the planet the clouds carbon dioxide the planet are highly corrosive because sulfuric acid any craft made any type metal will melt about roughly days depending the size the craft the atmospheric pressure the planet about times greater than experience earth the temperature the ground averages over degrees farenheit but nasa has developed idea that might truely get humans close venus able study nasa says that they could send craft float hover about miles above the surface escape the harsh venusian storms and landscape thirty miles above the surface would around degrees farenheit and the pressure that high would somewhat like sea level here earth solar power would also beneficial for power and radiation would not exceed what experience earth but because the dense clouds not letting most light forms into the inner atmosphere would hinder insight the surface thus rendering the photography and videography unavailable they plan use mechanical computers that run because gears and levers and would not require electronics these forms computers were used during world war because they did not require electricity and how they are capable withstanding much punishment from harsh conditions this concludes how would worth while pursuit study venus and how nasa will help with the studying our sister planet,457,0.0,3
the author the passage the challenge exploring venus has used some substantial evidence try and coax towards believing that venus planet that has not been studied much should but think other wise venus risky investment with the technology that have available belive waste time and money venus where could used existing problems and studies planet where will most effective one portion the passage that the author tried push your face was the fact that venus had has great deal geographical similarities earth said things such venus the closest planet earth terms density and size which appeal certain group individuals who are fascinated the thought there being somewhere else like earth the author also says long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth this also would appeal that same group peple giving them the thought that they are going able live venus but still there are the harsh living conditions that contradict that thinking opposition what the author says about venus and its geographical similarities also need talk about the differences that cause problems not only for living the planet but also studying venus has atmosphere that percent carbondioxide which alone has ended the thought that venus can any longer sustain life they think could before also the atmosphere makes hard even get any documentation how the planet looks paragraph the author uses the substance silicon carbide example way get around the crazy atmosphere but this leads next point that the author failed even mention the passage all this study and exploration costs money the author forgot mention one the most crucial species the equation which where funding coming from and where could the money used more effectively economy the moment not stable and are great need help but that does mater some they are more focused the future how are going advance but without good present situation there way could proceed the money could given the city flint michigan that they are able drink and bathe themselves with clean water sure that costs way less fix the pipelines city that take years and fly venus venus and the other planets are cool specials but were given our own plant that have beaten and mistreated for years but don back and fix the problem search for somewhere else destroy think that should least try better the situation with the money that have for the planet that have not spend the exploration the others,563,0.0319715808170515,4
dear florida senator citizen believe that the electoral college system isn very smart idea you think about pretty unfair votes live country where they say that have the right vote but reality with the electoral college system play that right taken away from basica lly when vote don actually vote for the president himself are voting for the slate electors hopes that they vote the way would like them too although rare that electors votes against his own party isn unheard that right there huge reason why cant trust this system cant control who our electors vote for worst case there tie the electoral vote and the election thrown the house representatives where state delegation vote the president because each state only gets one vote there would only one person representing the voters wyoming and person representing the people that live california this unbalanced way represent each state basically the electoral college unf air voters because the winner takes all system candidates don spend much times the smaller states because they don count for many votes they focus the larger swing states that will count for more for example during the campaign there were states that didn even get the chance see the candidates all their defense the electoral college does avoids run off elections for example nixon had only percent plurality popular votes but won the electoral vote there lot pressure when candidate wins the people vote and this stress reduced which produces clear winner all all the electoral college unfair outdated and can trusted people who support need reality check they don realize that the system completely disregards their voting rights citizen,409,0.0,4
driverless cars are coming with all the new technology driverless cars are defiantly high requested divize both positive and negative features come along with driverless car belive driverless cars something should not have due the loss high quality attention when driving regular car iphones galaxies tablets radios are just few reasons why drivers get distracted the driver seat regular car controled completely the driver but how can they that well texting and having the radio playing loud its able guessed they cant thats where the smart car comes the only thing the drivers need ready when there control needed what there accident ahead and the lights are flashing alert the driver but the driver looking out the window and misses the light who takes control when the seat vibrating but the driver bouncing and down the new song the radio who turns the wheel when there contruction dead ahead and the car telling the driver take control but cant hear over the person talking the cell phone even with the smartest car you arent guaranteed the smartest driver that note the driverless car doesnt seem like very good idea even with the smartest car you still have the everyday electronics distracting the drivers from doing their jobs wether its regular car driverless car its dangerous either way when trusting the driver behind the wheel,313,0.0191693290734824,2
the world becoming more and more reliable technology time passed people have become very reliable computers cell phones and many other types technology now the article driverless cars are coming discusses the idea possibly having cars that drive themselves the future the author shows both the positive and the negative effects this possibility however completely against the development driverless cars one major reason that opposed this idea the cost would cost lots money able manufacture these cars first the plan was not build smarter cars but build smarter roads general motors created track test out this plan however the article states these smart road systems worked surprisingly well but they required massive upgrades existing roads something that was simply too expensive practical the concept making improved smarter roads was not option another example driverless cars costing too much money talked about paragraph the text talks about how the cars would need lot smarter this would mean that they need have bunch sensors all around the car quote from the text that supports this says google modified toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor would still cost lots money fund for the smarter cars due the large amount technology needed another reason that strongly against driverless cars safety issues there could many things that could wrong with the advanced technology for example the driverless cars are designed drive themselves but can not handle driving through construction zones around accidents the article states this means the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires believe that this would huge issue person could easily fall asleep while the car and not able take over the vehicle mind this would cause lot accidents leading into final reason there was accident whose fault would not only will the traffic laws need changed for this happen but also new liability laws with need developed the case accident the article says the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer that big question that could lead many problems think that driverless cars could cause more lawsuits made order figure out this one single question opinion not agree with the idea developing driverless cars would cause lose too much money whether create smarter roads smarter cars would big safety issue and also cause more lawsuits filed and problems court creating such improvements like driverless cars will only lead issues the future,624,0.0,4
dear state senator personally think that should not have the electoral college because the citizens should allowed pick our president and vice president should the people not the congress according paragraph three source one the electoral college consist five hundred and thirty eight electors canidate has earn two hundred and seventy those votes that not right why spend time bringing these people vote when you have whole state full people who wants have voice the matter also the congress does not know what the people want you pick canidate and not what the people what may planning blow the world the citizens the united states know what they wan leader and they know what they look forward the future letting congress select our president your not letting speak for our self and that wrong according paragraph fifteen source three electoral college widely regarded anachronism and needs bee overruled which strongly agree with also paragraph sixteen source three states that citizens choose their representative and they trust them pick the right person but that trust often betrayed why would you keep having this election soon enough people are going stop caring according paragraph eleven source two the electoral college waist time and not needed because people are starting not care and are not even choosing their own canidate they are not liking who their state chose and they dont care because state legislatures are responsible for picking electors anyway some states choose two slates and send them congress like hawaii did things like this why dont need electoral colleges what happens again what there tie electoral college every state could only cast one vote they have one representative for lets say five hundred thousand voters that doesnt make any sence all how come everyone doesnt vote for who thy want themselves maybe someone whats president frome another state instead their own according paragraph fourteen states that the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational and agree one hundred percent bob dole says abolish the electoral college closing hope you will view favor and everyone elses who says this type system old unfair and needs ruled out thank you for reading letter and hope you enjoyed hearing about what think was pleasure writing you and really hope you take opinion into consideration thank you again and have wonderful day sincerely proper name,532,0.0093984962406015,3

greetings state senator looking over the electoral college there has come few interesting details yes the process beautifully thought out but look deeper has its flaws the founding fathers have given the electoral college which anarchist are very unappreciative veiling non democratic way vote the electoral college system goes then americans can have their full constitutional rights using this process voters are not voting for the elector their choice voters are voting higher qualified voters vote for the elector the whole process violator the amendment entitled voting having this maze voting for voters what voter confuses who the elector voting for their vote sint actually going the canidate their choice before the election john kennedy the segregationists the louisiana legislator came very close replacing all the democratic electors with electors who opposed john kennedy all the voters favor jfk will voting agaist him and all the electoral college votes would going the other canidate bradford plumer says excerpt from the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defences are wrong the most basic level the electoral college unfair voters plumer makes very valid point beacuse the size states the electoral college number representatives are big their states population all the representatives alaska vote the republican canidate and most the people california vote for the democratic canidate the electoral college vote california overrules the vote alaska the electoral college can make some voters not want vote usually because their state size their vote doesnt count much many voters larger states refuse vote because their vote wont really change the electoral collage vote the voters don have total control over elector the whole election crisis could happen again conclusion the electoral college may have worked when the colonies were small and the votes counted but today the modern society doesnt appreciate its lack constitutional rights all ask for our right vote given can take part our government student,443,0.0135440180586907,4

the facial action coding system impressive creation shows advancements technology that could potentially make everyday activities much simpler there place and time when this sort technology could useful however feel that this technology not for everyone the facial action coding system not valuable valuable for students classroom because takes away peoples privacy expensive and students can reach out teachers needed the first reason why think that the facial action coding system unneccessary that takes away people privacy live world that technology controls most our life sometimes this useful and makes our lives much easier however when personal information given out the internet gets into the hands the wrong people bad things happen the facial acting coding system might make people feel uncomfortable especially since you are giving away what you look like the device students might not want have obligated use this sort technology and they shouldn have the second reason why think that the facial action coding system unneccessary that expensive lot money goes into paying for the technology that use schools some students get school laptops which essential for some the homework that are assigned some teachers get electronic whiteboards the classroom further enhance the teaching that they however facial action coding system not needed for the amount money that would into most highschools have lot classrooms ours has three floors and the price pay put this device each room would not worth the final reason why think that the facial action coding system unneccessary that students can reach out their teachers needed there are students who struggle with subjects they learn school happen struggle learning socal studies since was fifth grade the biggest mistake made that could have lead this that did reach out teachers was getting social studies fifth grade and came the point where mother made reach out not only teacher but the principal sat room and mother teacher and the principal all discussed with why was going off track and they gave chance improve did not need facial action coding system tell what was going wrong students just need talk with their teacher they confused the teacher should not have modify their lesson all the time because students are becoming bored their class there may place time that the facial action coding system useful like detect politician isn being truthful stated the article however this technology just not fitted for classroom because takes away people privacy expensive and students can reach out their teacher needed the classroom place where students learn not become subjects distracting technology,613,0.0048939641109298,4

driverless cars are futuristic thing that everyone has always been dreaming they are cars that can drive themselves while the passangers just relax and sit now although this may seem like very good and helpful thing humans could use has its problems which why think should not have driverless cars one the reasons that believe should not have driverless cars because lot taxi drivers would lose their jobs even though the passage says that would use half the fuel todays taxis the cab drivers lose their jobs could potentially hurting family although does not seem like very big issue still problem that comes with the car unemployment rates are already low having people lose jobs due car doesnt seem very fair struggling families another reason believe should not have driverless cars its potentially more dangerous even though the car could have more knowledge what because thats what was made for see the problem here that with all the computers involved with the car easy for hackers hack into them hacker messes with the computer software could really mess what the car was designed someones computer the car starts glitch and fails while driving this will end badly multiple wrecks could happen all once just like the passage says the technology fails and someone injured who fault one argument person could use that the cars would have more knowledge about driving than actual person would which could helpful reducing car accidents people drive recklessly all the time which yes this true think about the future though have only driverless cars the future one would even have the slightest idea how drive sure they would least get the basics driving but what one day the computers just fail and the internet longer use people who are the road when this could occured may die with with this kind problem their would far more fatalities than couple wreckless drivers the road conclusion believe that should stick our regular cars many things can wrong with driverless cars wrecks could happen and many people could die although even with regular driving fatalities can happen just think would much safer stick our regular cars,495,0.006060606060606,4

the use this technology extremely valuable thing computer can tell how you are feeling just your facial expressions computer can know how change what you are seeing detects that you are not interested confused unhappy with what you see the screen knowing how keep someone interested with what they are doing huge challenge sometimes people get bored with what they are doing and don want anymore the computer could tell that you are getting bored and will try variety things until they find one that you are interested for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next wil different paragraph computer can also tell when person becoming confused with what they are learning the computer can detect the confusion and change the lesson make easier understand for example classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor paragraph not only does make easier for that student better understand the lesson but makes easier for the teacher too the teacher wouldn able detect exactly how the student feeling with what they have and occasionally the students don feel comfortable enough let the teachers know computers may have code that help identify the facial expressions but some humans don really show much facial expression how they are feeling for example most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication notes huang computers need understand that too paragraph however humans who not show great amount facial expressions can still show slight amount which would enough for the computer detect can also detect when you are showing false facial expressions because they are more strained than genuine for example all about those muscular action units they even indicate the difference between genuine smile and forced one the real smile the zygomatic major muscles that begin you cheek bones lift the corners your mouth paragraph can also figure out genuine smile looking for crow feet which are wrinkles around the corners your eyes the important message here that computers being able identify the facial expressions human face extremely valuable thing have classrooms can detect boredom confusion and unhappiness there may still things that need working with recognizing the emotions because there are stoic people but overall could great help student and teacher classroom,559,0.0017889087656529,4

response driverless car technology personally against think there are certain things that can lazy about and strongly believe driving one those things now commend the engineers who have worked hard this fascinating technology but just because think the invention cool doesn mean effective our everyday lives great technology the times live can always make mistake think that risking people lives them not having drive risk wouldn personally take yes see how would nice getting driven around but could only matter time until mistakes start arise point find very important make the danger with mishaps occurring this isn just the type technology can have small glitch and then fine later small glitch were happen with this technology and results can devastating now know that these cars can signal the driver take over when something goes wrong but sometimes only take split second and then its late for anyone anything take over another very important topic the deal with the legal system and that just seems like problems top problems just waiting happen when say the deal with the legal system what refering who would responsible for accident would the blame the driver rider you could say would the manufacturer know realize that laws would put place but can help but feel that these laws would favor the big companies that produce these machines what have been trying say have come the conclusion that the list cons having driverless car are much greater than the list pros one thing sure that these cars come out that they will quite expensive which might hidden blessing what mean but that that while some people might sad they can afford this vehicle they might actually saving themselves from possible injury and complications the future hope that these vehicles become available the public that people will seriously consider the risks before investing their money into driverless car,465,0.0064516129032258,4

dear senator electoral college may despised method some people but has been the system established our founding fathers and remains until this day may not perfect but every method has its flaws including popular vote respectively the popular voting system not the best method since can end not defining certainty the outcome electoral college has prevailed until this day and should remain this way for the united states america although electoral college may called outdated irrational and unfair brandon plumer this isnt true because were outdated and unfair would have been substituted changed another system but has remained because its efficiency this system certainly not unfair because stated article richard posner explains each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the party nominee and that trust rarely betrayed for the irrational portion the opposing view stated defense the electoral college article has multiple reasons but one them the electoral college requires presidential candidate have transregional appeal region south northeast etc has enough electoral votes elect president the single best argument against electoral college may called the disaster factor claimed brando plumer his article opposing the electoral college certainty outcome strong point for richard posner his article defending the electoral college and carefully states dispute over the outcome the electoral college vote possible happened but less likely than dispute over the popular vote richard posner also reminds the reader that the electoral college avoids issues elections which candidate receives majority the votes cast and there pressure for run off election when candidate wins majority the votes cast another factor brought our attention the indefensible electoral college article that since the electoral college uses the winner take all system each state candidates dont lose time states they are most likely not win and they focus mostly swing states although the swing states system used simply utilized because induces the candidates seen election but the voters toss states are most likely pay more attention the campaign and decreed that the most thoughtful voters should the chosen ones decide the election ultimately with all the information cited quite obvious which option best for the electoral college may have cons but the pros outweigh this not new method was defined the founding fathers that wrote our constitution that has held our country unisem until this day now still the leading force the government and should kept that way the electoral college the best suited for america and should altered sincerely future voter,585,0.0119658119658119,4

from the time that school had been implemented necessary component modern society the emotions and behaviours students have correlated the interest they have the lessons they were learning the behaviours are sometimes not analyzed causing the teacher the class either bore his students sleep giving his students much freedom that they don have the patience carry out the work required them teacher and class evaluations have been formed try and fix this issue but they are not reliable but multiple chose questionaire isn the way determine the characteristics human being device that could analyze the behaviours student would better represent that person using technology order read the emotional expressions student classroom would valuable because the students emotions show how they respond given lesson implementing technology that would allow teacher know how his students were responding lesson being given would improve the quality the lesson being given order fit the needs tthe student well helping the teacher better improve his lesson plan balance out the amount mentally taxing work and relaxing activities that correspond the lesson well known fact that many students not enjoy class because they not like the way the teacher goes about informing his students this problem often leads students being disengaged lesson and not learning what was taught the teacher however not aware that the student not engaged and continues teaching the same unappetizing lesson with algorithm that would able analyze the way students responding lesson however the teacher would able alter the lesson engage his students most students not tell their teacher that they are not interested what being taught but alto explains most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication alto analyzing the nonverbal actions the student help give accurate representation what the way student responds the information being taught teachers have tried doing evaluations learn the way the students feel but these are unreliable and often take unnecessary time with technology that allows the teacher know how the students feel automatically would save time for both the teacher and the student well let the teacher respond any issues much more quickly than with evaluation conclusion implementing technology that would allow the teacher know exactly how the student responds lesson being given would valuable this process could potentially allow the teacher alter lesson way that becomes more engaging and would also eliminate the need for inaccurate teacher evaluations that waste time the changes that come with technology will beneficial classrooms everywhere and could potentially fix the long lasting problem students becoming uninterested lesson class,558,0.0125448028673835,4

prof thomas huang prof nicu sabe and paul eckman have come with techonology that can know exactly what and how many emotions person has right now this technology called the facial action coding system facs students would benefit from this technology because the facs would know they were bored confused modify the lesson like real teacher and help the student understand the lesson better and earn good grade result the facs would know the student was bored confused because constructs detailed image the face with all major muscles then compares the image the image neutral face with emotion and looks certain muscles the computer looks the zygomatic major for example see you are smiling genially becasue the corners your mouth would pulled back would also look for your frontalis pars lateralis tell you are suprised something because your eyebrows would raised the facs would also able measure exactly how many emotions you have because the technology weighs different units student was bored confused the facs would able modify the lesson therefore helping the student understand the lesson more the computer now would not know the student was having trouble becasue can not see what the student face look like but with the help the facs the computer knows what the student feeling and can change what the lesson about help the student just like real teacher the facs would know what the student was thinking and able change how the lesson was worded hopefully help the student understand what was saying the facal action coding system would able modify the lesson just like experienced and effective teacher would with the facial action coding system modifying the lesson the student would earn better grade result than the lesson was not modified the student would most likely better both the homework and the test because the lesson was reworded much more impactful way than was originally the student does better the homework and test then the overall grade would increase well the percentage passing grades for the class the facs would modify the lesson thereby increasing the amount passing students and helping the school earn better grade from the department education the facs would able see student was confused bored and she bored confused modify the lesson accordingly therefore increasing the overall grade the student received the facial action coding system would able help the student she was confused rewording the lesson iin the way the student would understand better the facs would great addition classroom because would help the students understand what the lesson was saying,565,0.0088495575221238,4
the facial action coding system excellent way analyze different emotions people but should used classrooms identify students emotional expressions think having technology classroom that detects emotions students can new way learning can help show how today technology has advanced the facial action coding system can help students learn something new for example the muscles their faces the article states your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you surprised your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips show anger the author stated muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palabras makes crow feet around your eyes but false smile the mouth stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and different muscle the pistorius this technology can very helpful learning system anatomy specific jobs like behavior analysis during history class student might dozing off not even paying attention because the topic isn interesting him her they don understand huang states classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor the facial action coding system can help students learn more effectively but also make learning fun them just the scan their facial expressions the text also states imagine computer that knows when you happy sad for example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different this new technology system can make going school fun and can demonstrate where their future has hold for them the facial action coding system can useful any where such the fbi having this new technology system doesn always help detect emotional expressions but can new way learning can help show how today technology has advanced and how still advancing,401,0.0074812967581047,4

think bad idea get driverless feel there would many people who just would blow off their responsibility safe driver thnk this because they wouldnt driving the car the car would driving itself and that would make people pay less attention but dont get wrong would nice and amazing idea could all responsible enough and pay attention that dont cause accidents these cars would also help from accidents because would smart enough know when there stop sign anything like that some things that could ruin this idea would you thought about what they mal function and the car crashes and seriously hurts someone sure that the cars saftey system air bags and other things would become one the prime resources did mal function feel more people would trust this car there was percent something how efficent this car would some other major problems would the price range mean lets serious one wants spend alot money car that isnt worth think the car was little cheaper and was alot more reliable being able pull over and stop without human work the part that good about the car telling the driver help would keep the drivers alot more the road then they would could stop and pull over all its own one more problem can see about this there would alot more texting the road then needed which would probably cause alot more carelessness when people care driving then would cause more accidents,328,0.0152439024390243,3

driverless cars are cars that drive its own and you not have control what ever google has had these cars ever since they are said that these cars are all working from the computer and the manufacturers these cars seem have lot benites but the same time there are many downsides these driverless cars these cars seem pretty troublesome with things such conflict lack attention and the roads driverless cars can start lot arguments suppose you got car crash while using one these driverless cars who fault would that the driver the manufacturer could said that the driver because they were not paying enough attention the car and roads and their fault that they did not control then again could also said that the manufacturers fault because they could have engineered wrong and have some flaws another downside about driverless cars the lack attention that some people will have when looking out for the roads people are lazy and when they hear the word driverless cars they automatically assume that they will not have any work and will just sit back and relax this leads people not paying attention the road and not dealing with the car when the car alerts take control said the article not only you have have smart cars but you will also need have smart roads this impossible because you can not arousing changing every road would cost too much and take forever now said that the solution this that you would just have make smarter cars but how smart can they get will most likely that there will some roads that the car just not smart enough conclusion driverless cars are not what they are cut out the arguments that would arise the lack attention and apparently the dumb roads are only handful downsides and issues the driverless car really worth much when you yourself can just drive many people this day drive and not such big deal can not resort even more lazier ways when the computer does all the work soon will just doing nothing and electronics will doing everything for and comes say how much smarter can car get,486,0.0102880658436214,4
the passage driverless cars are coming cars are shown futuristic cars that can run drive steer and basically everything normal car would able except driven computer arguments have been shown some say dangerous and others say good thing these cars are believe bad thing becuase cars are not safe all automatically driven themsleves human the safest and most effective way possible drive car not driven computer created makes driving fun safer fact this very dangerous act that should not invented evidence and details from the passage paragraph states that most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety best achieved with alert drivers and this saying that basically computer automatic self controlled car not safe drive and that the safest way drive car have alert human behind the wheel driving highly agree with this becuase driving car much more safer and effective towards pedestrians passengers the driver the vehicle and other drivers unlike automatic computer self controlled car which not safe effective all and actually very dangerous also says that the car will able detect when too close going too fast about wreck stated paragraph states that the car can handle driving functions speeds mph but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel also they can steerer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents etc futuristic cars are not safe drive all simply becuase more accidents could occur drivers are not controlling the car all all the computer controlling even though the car has cameras inside watching the driver making sure they are focused the road paragraph this not only safe and somewhat dangerous wyda but also creepy imagine you were inside computer controlled car that has cameras inside watching you based the evidence and details from story proven that these cars are both safe and dangerous drive should drive these cars believe the answer myself because yes these cars are somewhat safe drive but they are also very dangerous drive well all this depends how the driver and the car respondio certain things while driving though way but still dangerous and they should not created permitted fro driver drive,597,0.0117252931323283,4
the author states the very end the passage our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation that powerful explaining that just because stuff here earth just because find something out does not mean that stop there means strive and conquer our mission more and here why the scientists want samples however that would very risky despite the risks scientists would have get close and personal with venus they personally know that there are lot risks getting close venus they mentioned that could melt spacecraft matter couple hours however they are determined the author mentioned venus had lot value also stated not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors this has meaning and what means that not only the scientists want know about venus and their ideas may lead exploring venus but human curiosity will also take over and other people will want know about venus well conclusion scientists want know and explore venus and normal people are going want understand and learn about venus well the scientists need this information further the progression learning and experimenting with venus they are probably going whatever takes learn about venus despite the dangers and fatal risks going there they will more than likely one day get there but there will probably lot trial and error along the way,343,0.0,2
using technology called the facial action coding system facs classroom not good idea the facs enables computers read human emptions such sad happy scared etc uses computer model the face and and the major muscles read your emptions using the facs classroom not good idea becuase can cause distraction limit human contact and limit the amount one one time teacher has help the students the facs should not used the classroom becasue could cause distractions for the students the students could more focused what the computer says than what the teacher teaching the facs breaks down then student could feel left out and sad and that could distract them from performing their best school the computer could also allow students get off task and only focus what happening the computer the facs built into regular laptop could cause students play games other things the internet than learn the class the facs can very distracting students they sould not found the classroom school meet new friends bond with teachers and have human contact all day long the facs the classroom could cause all that disappear this means that teachers could become less engaged with the class and students can become less engaged with learning huang states that most human communication nonverbal incuding emotional communication computers not have emptions like huangs the computer may able tell how are feeling but they can not make feel better are sad scared distress this can cause students feel more isolated and make them more sad scared etc when students feel this way could sause more school violence facs should not the classroom the third and final reason that the facs should not the classroom because can limit the teachers one one interaction with students huang states classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored teachers are there teach interact with the students and sense they are confused the facs does that for them and helps the student they are confused then the teacher not there help the student this could also cause the student more confused the computer teaching them instead real life teacher facs should not the classroom because will limit the contact between student and teacher the facs amazing innovation but should not found the classroom should not allowed the classroom becuase can distraction students limit human contact and limit the amount one one time teacher can have with student important that school place interact with others and futher your education but having computer read your emptions class will damage the school experience therefore the facs should found the classroom,601,0.016638935108153,3

wow wouldn you think that exporting the sea going volcanoes and jumping out planes would fun well being nasa scientist can fun don you think would very interesting seeing what space here tell you that the face natural landform have several claims support argument that the face natural landform many people believed that the face was created aliens but have they seen the aliens how would they know that the aliens did they didn see them what just illusion and peole think face they dont have enough proof there are many evidence that found that statements are true the article states that thousands anxious web suffers were waiting when the image first appeared jpl web site revealing natural landform there was aliens monument after all also states that the camra board mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face perhaps said skeptics alien markings were hidden haze they didn know for sure why would they think aliens did that why the face just natural landform there are such thing aliens the face just something created nature and nothing eles people need start think about what they say,279,0.025089605734767,3
nasa scientist and you don believe the evidence have you just want believe that they were created aliens really feel like nasa have all the evidence prove you non believers that the face was not created aliens but only appears face because the pictures you have seen have beter pictures and going prove you that the face was not created aliens going tell you why the face isn created aliens but just rock first the face made out face because the picture taken one nasa spacecrafts viking was picture taken accident while viking was searching for its sister ship viking was taking pictures possible landing sites for viking the picture was taken accident with not the best camera that was available might have been the best one the time but better cameras were developed over time second when the mission controllers the jet propulsion lab recieved these photos their monikers they must have been surprised but they soon figured that was just another martian mesa because was common around cydonia only the mesa had unusual shadows make look like egyptian pharaoh lastly few scientists believed that the face was alien artifact getting photographs became main priority for nasa about eighteen long years after the viking missions ended when the mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time gather picture that was ten times sharper than the original viking photos for those non believers factual evidence the picture was revealed actually natural landform which why the called face that was created aliens was not created them after all you don believe still pretty sure that have showed you all the evidence that proves you wrong you could try say that the second picture was still not close enough and was cloudy well the mars global surveyor got close enough for second look and the third picture taken had each pixel that spawned meters compared the vikings meters per pixel have presented all the evidence prove you that the face was not created aliens but just like butte mesa landforms common around the american west right,485,0.0061855670103092,4
the article the author talks about the ups and downs getting know venus planet and having human life live their now even though their are good parts about exploring venus there are many bad and dangerous parts about venus like for example the begining the article the author talks about how every mission was unmanned because they couldn even survive the planet for longer than few hours also they even talk about how venus has thick atmosphere nearly percent carbon dioxide and thaton just blankets venus this tells that have less chances even surviving venus venus weather also horrible their tempter average over degrees they have things like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes know that these are things that happen earth nearly everyday every now and then but with all that plus the heat might not even able survive there the author does talks about how and ave ship orbiting hovering over the planet safely but researchers wouldn able take samples rocks gas anything what would the point even going down there can even really explore the postive things about venus one venus already one our sister planet and referred earth twin the closest distance size destiny and even the most earth like planet our solar system have many things alike that well help people feel better about even getting explore venus another thing that the article the author states that havent touched venus more than meaning that don know what down there things could have changed drastically would never know the author also includes how the planet has rocky surface sediment and has many features such valleys mountains and craters plus venus was polay even cover largely oceans that could have supported many forms life the author use these facts show what can benefit form exploring venus they jevne put how nasa compelling the idea sending researchers down study venus the last thing the author states how should keep our limits small just becuase were afraid the dangers that mhigh happen but should expand them and think them challenges too include venus can worthy studying and exploring just with little more reseachers and better technogym the author shows that might actually have chance living venus,508,0.0393700787401574,4

for centuries have followed cherian system established our founding fathers this system called the electoral college this system based off voting for the president through electoral votes rather than based off more popular the state has overall say through its electors believe that this system unfair and should abolished the electoral college should abolished because you are not vomiting directly for the president you are voting for elector who would turn elect the president while you may end pleased others may feel the complete opposite believe that unfair not directly vote for the president beacuse should completely this nation elect president the system they have set right now injustice the second reason the electoral college should taken away that the system has much room for failure electors could easily betray the will the people they have much more power than the standard voter the electors would completely oppose the most popular vote and put their vote for whoever they feel deserves this wrong and totally goes against the idea giving the people power this would qualify just giving few people power there could also room for tie this could result the deletion ending the hands the house representatives where the state delegates could chose the president not only this destroying the power the general public but this could also result people not getting what they wanted the delegates cold completely against what the people say because they technically have the right since they have the power the situation the final reason the electoral college system should left behind the fact that not every state gets see the candidates some the smaller states that don count for much the vote tend lean towards different party don even get visit from the candidates not only that unfair but also completely demeaning towards the state makes the citizens the state feel unworthy not important enough for not even making effort for their vote this also stupid move the candidates part because they might have been able persuade the state vote conclusion the electoral college not functional system for its characteristic being completely indirect for taking away the power the people and for its room for error although may seem like trustworthy system first don fooled whats more important the power and opinions the people the power and opinion the delegates,507,0.0216962524654832,4
