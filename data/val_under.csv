there are lot things that develop and hold electoral college together there are also lot down falls the electoral college every state has house representative plus your senators the electoral college there are total people but them the majority vote that wins there are total reasons why have keep this method choosing the president the ways are certainty outcome everyone president swing states big states and avoid run off elections the main reason have electoral college they have right way choose president the main reason for this that dont leave our electing the hands foriegn people immigrants the what the president needs get elected the electoral college there are still lot down falls this method the electoral college though one these issues the most basic level the electoral college unfair voter this means winner takes all which they only focus the bigger states and not the smaller ones because the bigger states have bigger population which means they have more the electoral college another issue with this method that the person thats running for president might get the popularity vote but still not win see everyone that votes isnt really voting directly for the president the people who really count the electoral college order win the vote you have convince the electoral college and thats not always easy remember just because you won popular vote doesnt mean you won the majority the electoral vote there are reasons why keep this method electing the president the first reason certainty outcome this means less likley than dispute over the popular vote which really means the candidates share the other people the electoral college there share the popular vote and thats how they vote the second reason everyone president this basically shows that the electoral college requires presidential candidate have trans regional appeal this means that region such south northwest etc has enough electoral votes elect president the third redstone keeping these methods swing states this tells that its the winner takes all method the fourth method why should keep these methods the big states this explains that the electoral college restores some the wight the political balance this means that the bigger states get big advantage the electoral because the people that get elected into office there based off population they have advantage the bigger states get more attention from the candiates then the smaller states the final reason why should keep this method voting avoid run off elections this means the electoral college navios the problem elections which candidates recieve majority the votes cast this means pressure for candidates when they win majority the votes cast there are many ways develop and hold the electoral college together there are many ways that falls apart and has flaws but its the best way for our econony vote for president you think about just did popularity vote that would like leading our hands into world immigrates who know very little there lot rules for our electoral process buyat its the best way and the only way have becoming better place dont forget look the reasons keep this the way,699,0.0128755364806866,4

the driverless car seems like interesting invention that could possibly keep drivers safe and form good habits but what just makes the problem worse the driverless car new and might give hand the road there also the possibility that the cars malfunction don respond commands these cars are part the age technology and all know that not always helpful smart cars take long time assemble and adjust with all the sensors motion sensors and gps there hass something the car that hasn been looked over the gps has update aware own surroundings that may seem like handy feature but gps aren always right and this could lead trouble the sensors the car are able detect danger the roads but they can only detect certain distance away the automakers used speed sensors the wheels detect out control skids and rollovers they have advanced able signal the brakes when this happens these operations still need improvements though the big problem nowadays texting and driving the roads are lot more dangerous with people constantly getting distracted the road and this has caused many injuries and deaths now how would car that can operate itself help get rid these habits the answer they don allowing drivers take easy the roads and lazy isn going help anything adding alarms the car can lower accident rates but people shouldn need alarmed danger driver should watching the roads like hawk does prey adding safety features can only much keep someone safe what needed most feature that can break these habits bad drivers some manufacturers are also considering using cameras watch that drivers are remaining focused the road while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver that actually good thing make sure people behave right when driving the driver forms better habits then wont have thing worry about sensors detect pedestrians and other cars coming provide better transportation and lower accident rates most driving laws focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe with these new advancements personal transport are making the world little safer that doesn mean that saved the world from the apocalypse anything,491,0.0040733197556008,4

the passage the author does not support the idea well the formatting the essay incorrect the supporting details are also extremely unrealistic the passage the author states that the surface temperature high that can melt vast amount metals therefor would make sense for humans not later they state that scientists are working blimp like vehicle float thirty miles above venus surface this refutes the the part the essay which the author explaining that scientists would have the surface collect research samples also the whole idea exploring venus undermined because floating thirty miles above defeats the purpose exploring venus the author states the atmosphere makes difficult view using photography and videography this would make reasearch extremely difficult because they will not able see the planet surface the author does not sufficiently support their argument the evidence used unrealistic the author continues make arguments for their side and then refute them,200,0.0,3
the challenge studying venus very interesting story the story the author tells lot about venus and its harsh conditions the title describes the story very well venus seems like would very challenging explore and the author gives many reasons why would difficult for some reason though doesnt really list any benefits exploring venus throughout the whole story the author just making venus sound like horrible place the article writes even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere again describing venus sound like awful place why would you want explore another good claim makes that since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours why would you explore venus space craft all them were destroyed where would not want explore venus the author has given plenty reasons not throughout the story the author does list least one benefit exploring venus the story writes may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system yes can agree that would great reason explore venus but here are the downsides that venus now not like earth more like destroyed earth the author writes the planets surface temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit you cant even walk the surface without burning how this like earth the author also mentions venus was probably covered largely with oceans all those oceans that may have been their are gone now why would explore destroyed earth conclusion the author does not give many benefits exploring venus all really did was list the benefits why shouldn explore venus personal opinion where scientist and somone read this would not want explore venus the end not believe the author makes good case explore venus,407,0.0098280098280098,4

the authors support the idea going venus not very well known can only infer whether they are for against because they never fully specify the author give some pros and cons the exploration the planet but does not pick one side more than the other believe that they author against the idea venus exploration the authors pros and cons list combat leash other because the author gives pro the exploration venus but instantly combats with another con weigh out one example this paragraph when the author states that the conditions floating above planet venus would difficult but survivable for humans however right after making that statement the authors first sentence paragraph combats the idea that survivable for humans because the article states however peering venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight ground conditions because most forms light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms photography and videography ineffective from that statement can infer that the author doesn really see the exploration humans going being very useful but can only infer because the author never specifies for against another way can infer that the author against looking paragraph when the author talking truthfully about the planet the author explains that planet venus has thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide and that the planet surface temperature averages out over degrees fahrenheit the way that the author describes venus not way much liking making sound like good planet send our people the author explains how dangerous venus listing the weather barrere like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightening strikes probes seeking land its surface all paragraph listing how dangerous the weather listing how hot and unlivable and saying that the lightening frequently strikes the probes trying get into the planets atmosphere land can only infer that the author doesn really think that the dangers humans being out into this kind situation worth additionally one last way can infer that the author doesn favor the idea venus exploration that when paragraph the author states each previous mission unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours that statment really pushes the idea that the author defiantly doesn not favor the idea the exploration using man and spacecraft but once again can only infer because the author never gave clear personal opinion conclusion believe that the author does not favor the exploration and does not think that the study venus worthy pursuit depsite the dangers provides the pros and cons weigh each other out the planet too dangerous with the heat the weather and the obstacles the surface the overall thought the author shows favor towards the exploration venus,613,0.0114192495921696,5

this new software could very good our schools and teachers could really tell what their students are feeling just looking the students facial action coding system could good for classroom setting can used for lots things but the things that are important are that the system could used see student really retaining the lesson that they are being taught the other use can used for that the system can used see student upset mad when first walking into school the last use for this system the student getting frustrated the work that their teacher has assigned them the part seeing student can really understand lesson the given student might not want tell the teacher that doesn understand lesson that the student doesn feel embarrassed this way using the technology the teacher can make that student feel comfortable and try see where the student getting confused the teacher can help the student hopefully they understand the lesson little more after one one the other use this facs that the teachers staff the school could possibly see student comes into school upset angry the adult could try and see why the student upset angry this would really help the student feel more positive school the adult would comfort the student and see where their problems are coming from then would help the student feel more safe inside the school the final use the technology that while student doing their work their teacher can see their student getting frustrated they are just completely lost the lesson this could result into the student getting help from their teachers and not getting low test scores and most teachers wouldn have worry about their student failing the class the teacher could assign tutoring the student and they could get some extra help with what they continue struggle the ending result that this technology should most defiantly schools this technology could literally change the ways certain people view the idea school and the work that comes with the number kids failing classes each year would most likely decrease since they could getting better understanding the lesson facs should our school system,464,0.0043103448275862,4
driverless cars are something that has always been the minds big inventors such sergey brin however much controversy comes with this specific topic there are both negatives and positives these driverless cars but think that they are good idea and could really impact our world for the better because already have some the technology would better for the environment and would safer first driverless cars are not new idea might seem like new idea but reality are already half way there already have antilock breaks and sensors plus google has been having these driverless cars for years now the article says reality google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since also states google modified toyota prius uses position estimating sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive radar sensors gps receiver and inertial motion sensor not mention the spinning sensor the roof that constantly updates the car surroundings sensors are nothing new though because the automakers used speed sensors the wheels the creation antilock brakes already have all this technology why don just the rest the way and push harder make independent cars thing secondly would much safer and cleaner for the environment everyone talks about how need take care the earth and cleaner resulting cleaner more fuel efficient cars with driverless cars would have the opportunity cut down gas and make the world little bit more cleaner safer place this because the cars would use half the fuel today taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus sergey brin the google cofounder says that belives such cars would fundamentally change the world finally these driverless cars would much safer than cars that are dependent driver all the time course there would still risks and things that could wrong safety wise but believe that would all safer with these independent cars for example google cars have driven more than half million miles without crash there would many many sensors the car make safer and more aware its surroundings like the scan the top the roof plus the cars would have the ability get the drivers attention when needed like vibrating the drivers seat flashing lights the windshield all these things would into making these independent cars safer than cars with constant driver conclusion believe that driverless cars are the way think this because already have much the technology make them would cleaner and safer for the environment and would much safer than cars today plus how cool would have car that does most not all the driving,613,0.0048939641109298,4

being able have car that drives itself would cool right well maybe not cool you think having car that drives itself comes with many complications these complications may include lack safety lack total automatic driving and lack laws needed operate smart car the smart car nice invention but with the lack safety isn very smart drive the systems within the smart car may fail and cause the operator injured having the systems fail the worst thing that could happen while driving smart car may cause accident the smart car not best quality this lack safety really worries driver myself while the smart car appears able drive without driver can the smart car can operate its own but requires the operator fully alerted all times because the car cant drive itself through certain situations these include accidents and work zones which would require the driver take the wheel and drive through these situations the driver would become bored while not driving and may even fall asleep the lack action just seems way dangerous trust automatic driverless car that isn fully automatic nor driverless with life many states now don even allow many smart cars driven order for these cars able the streets many laws would need made changed without laws just for these smart cars people would drive reckless laws are put place who will held responsible for the failing the systems smart car new laws will needed order cover liability the case accident laws are needed drove these cars matter the argument keep and those around safe smart cars still seem cool leave that answer you but take everything have said into consideration smart cars may the future but the way they are now too dangerous there are too many complications including lack safety lack automatic driving and lack laws needed operate smart car smart car really smart,448,0.0022321428571428,4
over twenty five years ago face was spotted that looked almost like egyptian pharaoh but was soon found out that this was just another mesa the cydonia region once this was seen alien theorists though they really believe was made aliens but here reasoning why they are wrong when the face was first spotted nasa viking spaceship the scientists the jet propulsion lab were amazed what they saw though was only little while when the scientists figured out was just another martian mesa but the shadows around gave the illusion face once this was released the public not people believe was mesa the alien theorists said the face bona fide evidence life mars even when the defenders nasa said wish there was ancient civilization mars this still did not make the alien theorists want back down years later michael malin photographed the face with his mar orbiter camera this picture was ten times sharper than the viking photos years before soon thousands people were waiting for the face appear but when did was shown natural landform alien formation even when shown this many alien theorists said that the clouds were blocking the alien markings mars global surveyor took picture the face there excuses whether not this mesa alien formation the sky was clear the picture was meters per pixel than the viking fourty three meters per pixel there not argument that this natural landform even there was something big the egyptian pyramids small shack you hould able tell what was picture like this after that picture was taken jim garvin said reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho also said that lava dome that takes the form isolated measat about the same hight the face mars this proof whether not the face natural landform after the first sighting the lastest picture taken the face mars clearly natural landform not alien formation,458,0.0152838427947598,3
there alot advantages limiting cars there disadvantages yes there but limiting cars can also dangerous well because the law enforcements needs cars and does the fire department even hospitals the law enforcement needs cars catch criminals faster and the fire departments need cars they can save from fires and save cats from trees how they even climb there who knows and the hospital needs them save patients get them the hospital faster doctors can save them but personally think its great idea have limited cars first all alot people would lose their jobs due limited cars such mechanics car dealers etc mechanics will out business because business and will the car dealers and cars dealers dont sell many cars the company might out business too but its good because they might think building better cars like the hybrid wont have much pollution wont have use natural gas the suburbs germany percent vauban families dont own cars and percent sold car move there when had car was always tense much happier this way said heidrun walter resident the suburb another advantage that much more peaceful and quiet the swish bicycles and the chatter wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor this sentence from the suburb life goes without cars explains that very peaceful because theres noise pollution and much more healthier people because they ride bikes everywhere and walk alot and theres pollution theres probably people who dont have breath nasty air cars even the environmental protection agency promoting car reduced communities and legislators are even starting the same people that have cars most likely walk alot and ride bikes even run well because that the amount stress people have probably very low because low stress people are happier and thats because excessive relieves stress and even reduce headaches other health problems even the death rate will decrease because there will less car accidents and car accidents are the numer one reason death and the united states bogota they were their third year where cars were banned but only buses and taxis were permitted for the day without cars this capital city million their goal promote alternative tranportation reduce nasty smog and violators faced fines the turnout this was large despite the gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers the rain hasnt stopped people from participating said the mayor bogota conclusion the advantages limited cars are great and the people car less cities areas are much happier without them people are healthier less stressed and even have less health problem due but who will save the cats from climbing trees maybe they wont climb because pollution scary car noises,599,0.003338898163606,3
what lies ahead will scary day when driverless cars become the new normal imagine roads filled with cars but the drivers are like nalbert zombies sure having cars that drive themselves sounds splendid but would the benefits really outweigh the cons for many people learning drive and getting their license huge milestone like one step closer becoming independant adult can imagine teens growing and never learning drive that would like not learning swim driving skill that people need aquire even driverless cars become popular because machines fail you can always depend machines accurate all the time you might thinking that machines don make mistakes often humans but humans are the ones that make the machines what happens you are riding driverless car and just stops working will you just sit there and wait die the passage says that most driverless cars aren actually driverless they need assistance from humans the fact that the car does most tasks like steering accelerating and braking makes easy for humans get distracted most people get distracted their cellphones alone they thought they could totally rely the car what they needed they would probably totally unaware their surroundings there reason that only few states allow the use semi autonomous cars the laws are written for cars that are controlled humans the laws place currently would not sufficient for self driving cars sure the laws could changed but who gets decide what the guides self driving cars should human brains are easily adaptable but machines need programmed what happens when car faces situation that isn ready for also what happens someone hacks into the car system and makes malfunction there could computer virus that would cause all the cars the world crash although think there are lots cons driverless cars acknowledge the benefits early versions semi driverless cars have been somewhat successful driving half million miles without crash however that doesn mean that totally autonomous cars will successful think certain features cars like cruise control are huge benefit but don know willing trust machines take the steering wheel yet who knows maybe fifteen years from now will own own driverless car but there are some huge advances that need made first,504,0.0079365079365079,4
self driving cars represent the most obvious step towards safer more efficient future driving course the idea seems appealing after all who doesn want someone drive for them while they stuck rush hour traffic but have more closely analyse the laws ethics and safety aspects before moving full steam ahead into what could possibly the future driving self driving cars have lot potential for both public and private use this type technology could major hit the consumer market self driving cars could take the most tedious part out road trips decrease the number traffic cops have employ under government pay one the most appealing aspects for lawmakers and voters the increased safety self driving cars this one the most heavily argued topics the entire debate over self driving cars even though google cars have been operating for over half million miles with only handful minor accidents one the other pros that isn mentioned nearly much the increased efficiency high traffic areas self driving cars are smarter merging and driving dense traffic meaning rush hour traffic jams could one day thing the past the other side the debate for self driving cars public transportation uber already planning self driving taxi service and other companies are sure follow self driving buses could also used with schools major cities having fully automated public transport system could make modern cities more efficient than they ever been unfortunately many these same benefits offered self driving cars have negative alter ego one the major effects increased automation increased efficiency however move towards fully automated world lose lot jobs unspecialized industries laws would also have reworked for nearly every aspect the traffic system how and why would teenage drivers take driving test they never going have drive car will human drivers and drivers fall under the same category the eyes the law there are still years and years legal red tape that has cut through before self driving cars can even make onto the consumer market addition there are solem ethical problems involved with programming self driving cars programmers and developers could fault for deaths caused bugs their program and what should you crash unavoidable should you sacrifice the passenger save pedestrian result believe that self driving cars can and should someday part our everyday lives however dozens laws will have rewritten commodities formed and lawsuits fought before can even judge automated cars under the same laws judge human drivers there huge amount potential for faster safer more enjoyable traffic system and lies self driving cars but for able implement any need make some very difficult decisions,583,0.0051457975986277,4

most you may most likely know whether through media friend the viking spacecraft photographed what appeared face the cydonia region mars this called face was created shadows rocks that made the illusion eyes nose and mouth actuality that all this face illusion many scientists are convinced that this face mars only just mesa although some fellow peers well conspiracy theorists are convinced that this face sign alien life order disprove the notion that the face mars fact sign alien life nasa photographed the same mesa the cydonia region once more april using the mars global surveyor mgs which had higher resolution camera than the viking this should have convinced the public and conspiracy theorists that the called face mars was only illusion the photograph showed face and only vague rocks and indents the surface the mesa but avail they claimed that since was cloudy when the picture was taken was covering what the face mars was supposedly hiding set out prove the conspiracy theorists wrong once and for all april final photograph was taken the face mars this time used even higher resolution camera meters per pixel the mgs what appeared was the exact same picture had taken alas one was satisfied and this day conspiracy theorists still question that the face mars mesa actually the mesa that had the face mars resembles many the mesas have here earth garvin stated reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho another piece evidence for the face being mesa that the photos following the original the face was where seen conspiracy theorists were right than the mgs photographs would have shown face and even alien symbols some theorists claimed those would some the markings the face unfortunately for them all that showed the images were rocks and indents conclusion base all the evidence gathered throughout years about the face mars all evidence points being mesa from the illusion created once but never recreated the resemblance the mesa ones found here earth,512,0.0,4

students not need computer telling them how they feel knowing how you feel something that one can change you change the facs just computer trying get into your mind but your mind your own personal business you only show sometimes when you want sometimes when strong you just have show opinion computer should not programmed into looking the outside not knowing whats the inside the saying not whats the outside what the inside but computer has emotion just what the programmer programed the computer computer can read someones smile even though they are depressed that happens all the time talk friends with smile but when talking about the same stuff therapist face little different because can express opinion very well friends the article says that each expression that the computer recieve compared neutral face meaning emotion humans always have expression there face therefore they always have somkid emotion there face the nuestra face probably looks like someone being angry sad possibly confused the computer doesn know what sarcastic smile looks like someone who truely smiling but there mouth fawning then the computer will see sadness the article also states that human communication mostly nonverbal including emotional huang said computers need understand that too frankly think that insane thinking that computers need know our emotions computers are just tool for knowlege well some our and some are just make you virtual world live the now don your computer show your face and have tell you how your feeling just listening your little voice inside your head listen that and feel from that everyone has emotions don ariad show people not robots enough said that the article does state that putting happy face actually works believe that have read articles relating that have tried putting happy face when was sad and kinda worked for but can get happy that easy but know probably works for lot people whoever thought that making faces could reveal much about the science emotions that statement opinion doesn really need said because showing your emotions and facial expressions something that every human has and science doesn really need improved for the facial expression conclusion beleive that computers don need know our emotions people need talk with each other and share then you could know more about someone instead,567,0.0158730158730158,4

the face mars was created aliens wasn because was common landform cydonia and looked like face because had unusual shadows that made look like and egyptian pharaoh the landform was called martian mesa they are well known for looking like faces and are very common cydonia you think that aliens created the face then how would change over years and the land think that the landform was created the erosion mars and that happens lot rock formations like the face are well known mars but the face was iconic because nasa unveiled the photo that was taken viking the whole world and the world was surprised they thought that the face was created aliens course but that was because was from different planet and they didnt see all the other mesas that were cydonia the photo also gave out many illusions eyes nose and mouth people thought the face was still created aliens but how couldnt have happened because the viking was snapping photos the land form for years and aliens appeared those photos the mgs and the moc showed much clearer pictures than the viking the photos revealed natural landform not created aliens but not everyone was satisfied because the photo was taken degrees north martian attitude whore was cloudy time the year therefore the mgs had peer through wispy clouds see the face maybe the alien markings were hidden haze garvin says not easy target cydonia because the mashad look down wide strips the mgs snapped the picture right moment didn wouldn have photo but cloudless summer day cydonia the mgs drew close enough for second look malin team took one last photo the highest resolution each pixel spans meters wich way better than the viking photo what the phos showed you ask the photo showed what looked like butte mesa often common the west the united states was landform not one created aliens the aliens made you said but was lava dome that takes form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars this shows that landform form mars and any planet although don know aliens are real fake they did not make this conclude things the photo that was taken gives you vivid look how the face was formed and shows you how lava makes them you still think that aliens did this then you need look the photos more closely,545,0.0073394495412844,4
lets begin with far there such thing aliens any extra terrestrial life for that matter also the face mars just natural land form stated the article the face mars was first discovered thr cydonia region the planet was discovered while the viking spacecraft was going around the planet taking pictures trying find landing space for sister ship viking although releasing the photo the public brought attention mars also lead people belive that there could life was life mars although few scientist believed that the face mars could alien artifact years later they returned the red planet because jim garvin explained that hwy felt was important taxpayers finally april the mgs flew over cydonia for the firt time michael manolin and his camera crue took picture ten times better than the photo that was taken the viking lot people were curious and nervous waiting the release the photo some were disappointed when was released because revealed natural landform they were disappointed because the face mars located degrees north martian latitude they weren satisfied with theiss because this latitude was winter april which cloudy time year for mars people were claiming that perhaps because the camera had oeser through thr clouds the alien markings were hidden the haze jim garvin chief scientist for nasals mars exploration program said that its not easy target cydonia infact its hard work then april the mgs was passing over cydonia and drew close enough for picture and they took the picture from the direct center the face also the picture that was taken was better quality than the two before and was taken cloudless summer day conclusion the face mars would have been ancient alien artifact you would have been able tell just natural land form although similar the lava dome the snake river plain idaho,436,0.0298165137614678,4

the intense debate concerning the validity the electoral college process difficult choose position the electoral college long standing tradition created the founding fathers the early days the united states however the reasons behind the adoption the electoral system are not valid today they were centuries before electoral college was proposed the founding fathers due the fact that the average american citizen the beginning our nation was simple farmer who was not educated enough make informed decision vote nowadays things are different general education the public very advanced and there are various easily assessable forms media from which learn about the policies and positions the presidential candidates after all the president job care for and protect the people america not the politicians therefore shouldn the people not the politicians elect the president even those who support the electoral college must admit confusing system when citizen votes for presidential canidate that vote really goes slate electors who were selected means that vary between states and are pleged that particular canidate and those electors then vote for the president pointed out bradford plumer the indefensible electoral college voters can control who their electors vote for additionally voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate also bradford the indefensible electoral college and bradford makes good point the past faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party canidate there also the fact that candidates for the presidency often focus swing states states whose majority not decided between political parties and whose votes have large impact the election this due the winner take all method the electoral college state that mostly republican democratic presidential canidate may not put much into the local campaing knowing that since most voters are against them they would probably lose the state and gain nothing because all the electoral votes state the canidate who won the majority voters that state thus presidential campaigns are focused the swing states giving little attention the others however the presidential election were decided popular vote campaing efforts would spread evenly across the united states since every voter everywhere counted the final election the method electing president popular vote fair and well balanced one giving the minority parties non swing states say the presidency also was discovered that according gallup poll over pecent voters would prefer direct election bradford plumer the indefensible electoral college was even admitted pro electoral college richard posner his defense the electoral college that tie the national electoral vote possible due the even number total votes posner also states that voter vote swings national election however everyone believed that one would vote all then there could election electoral college method otherwise therefore the individual voter does count and all the minority political parties who electoral slates not get vote for the president due the electoral college popular vote the only reasonable system for electing president who will their best for the american people the people for the people let the all the people vote,692,0.0086705202312138,5

dear senator the electoral college has always been good way elect our leaders and the best way has the ability use swing states for better voting larger and smaller states get different amounts electoral votes and presidents can not elected region alone the effect having swing states because the electoral college positive one because when state feels like they have chance having their candidate win they put more thought into the vote they cast knowing that their vote counts having voters put more thought into their votes instead not caring much gives the better candidate greater chance winning one candidate was truly better than the other the more thoughtfully candidates swing state will pull more information from the candidates campaigns popular vote does not use the winner takes all method the idea swing states will longer have any effect the election another great reason why the electoral college better than popular vote because depending the size the states certain amount votes given the electors larger states get more attention from presidential candidates because the majority vote the particular state there was only popular vote then presidential candidates could waste their time smaller states when they could been winning larger states the varying amount electoral votes for each state depending its size also allows for more equal and fair election due the less populated states not being able have more electoral votes then the more populated states the electoral college allows that presidential candidates can not win the election regional appeal this means that particular religion favors candidate they can not win only single regions votes this makes the candidates campaign less regions that are more likely won and more other regions but with the electoral college this makes harder for candidate with only regional appeal win because other regions feel like their votes will not effective towards the election with popular vote presidential candidate will not know where campaign and where not because there winner take all method this why belive that having the electoral college superior popular vote when the people vote for presidential candidates,442,0.0113122171945701,4

the electoral college gives certain states based their popularity number how many what guess can called points that will the candidate that gets the most votes for themself out that state now whether that good idea not completely based your own option which you can decide but disagree with the electoral college even though did take while thinking came the conclusion that all out popular vote more efficient when comes voting for president than the electoral college and there three main reasons that swung side with popular vote first all when you get right down the electoral college just doesnt give perfect accuracy who does actually get the exact most votes some people cant completely grasp this fact but imagine that there florida alaska and montana the first candidate which shall call john and the second bill are going for these three states john beats bill florida and john gets all electoral votes because that tough luck for bill luckily for bill sweeps over john alaska and montana and gets points from each state which gives him points total now popular vote bill would win with votes against john but since bill only has electoral points because still lost florida which was the state john won and got whopping points from bill will lose his campaign john because thats what the amazing wonders the electoral college are which basically sums how gore lost bill gates even that gore had more overall votes the electoral college also makes candidates have strategically plan out their campaign they can focus big states and swing states only candidate knows will not win certain state wont even focus because would pointless even changes maybe couple thousand voters minds wont get him single point loses that state whereas with popular vote changing the mind people that you get yourself from having california overall votes for you means more votes than literally all alaska eligible voting population that drives candidates away from states they wont win and they states known swing states that dont have specific party that they vote for every election and they will attempt win these states votes the most because those points will make the biggest difference the final thing like touch that the electoral college system takes many peoples idea and erases want our vote mean something throughout the whole campaign but doesnt matter you are one the few democrat supporters overall republican dominated state because when your state loses poof there goes your vote floating off into oblivion because doesnt matter now your one vote doesnt stand chance against going against according the electoral college want our vote count for the candidate himself not part some majorly flawed point system that someone thought would help somehow when picking the right candidate become the head honcho sitting charge the white house our country and the overall leader our military forces too need our vote heard and for actually count even more people disagree with the same state those votes should actually count towards something instead being overrun and erased the which will earn some candidate couple points for their campaign now after all this not only has own opinion strongly changed favor popular vote but hope yours has too electoral college just doesnt provide that actual perfect accuracy who wins that popular does forces presidents only visit and campaign certain states that they have chance winning and takes citizens votes and throws them down the drain more people the same state vote differently just makes you sit and wonder whos idea was accept this system,818,0.0048899755501222,5

dear dumb republican the electoral college stupid and should not use have many reasons believe that this unfair system that adulterating our country wonderful ways the first reason for why despise this system because have had people with more than half the country voting for them not elected president this due winning just enough certain states that you get their elector votes you win state with electoral votes but someone else wins state with electoral votes you will have more electoral votes but less popular votes the system that are set with electoral votes how you will get elected for president this happened during the presidental election when gore won the popular vote but busch won the electoral votes and was elected president also happened several times before most recently with the electoral college more likely that tie will happen this beacuse there are only electoral votes which lot less than million popular votes for every citizen there tie then the senate and house representatives has all this stupid stuff figure out who wins the process the electoral college the voters the smaller states are given more power than those the larger states every state gets minimum electoral votes and then more are added depending the size the state population with votes for population wyoming has more votes per citizen than the larger states large states with ten millions people may have only few more votes than wyoming does giving individual citizens more power choosing the president because the electoral college presidential candidates spend large portion their time swing states like ohio florida and little time states with predictable outcomes swing state state that could either way the election the candidates spend lot time convincing populates vote for them because the winner takes all method this unfair the states with predicted outcomes conclusion the electoral college old useless irrational and hurtful our country this why should abolish,466,0.0064377682403433,4
since the finding the face mars many people have been saying that must have been made from aliens mars however this not true there was life mars nasa would have found now because would benefit them some people think the face bona fide evidence life mars evidence that nasa would rather hide say conspiracy theorists meanwhile defenders the nasa budget wish there was ancient civilization mars therefor the face mars just natural landform because the amount pictures taken mars and the face the amount time taken research the face and all the nasa people saying resembles natural landforms that are earth first off know that the face mars just natural landform because all the pictures that were taken there was any alien life any kind mars nasa would have caught the article says malin team captured extraordinary photo using the camera absolute maximum resolution each pixel the image spans meters compared meters per pixel the best viking photo the author the article went into even more detail and said there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egytian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were this explains how good the camera quality and how they wouldn able miss anything including the amount picture evidence against life mars and the fact that the face was not made extraterrestrials the amount time spent researching the face nasa clearly shows they know what they talking about the first picture the face was taken and then was major hit and they took another picture years later then again after that also the article says and april when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time michael malin and his mars orbiter camper moc team snapped picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos this quote from the article shows what extent nasa researchers went find out more about the face there not already bunch reasons why the face mars just landform group people are agreeing with nasa decision that the face just natural landform according the article says scientists figured was just another martian mesa common enough around cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made look like egyptian pharaoh also stated the article what the picture actually shows the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho says garvin those quotes the article are proof that those same types landforms happened here earth well and the ones here were not made aliens conclusion the face mars just natural landform there was aliens mars making landforms then nasa would definately use that for publicity and make the taxpayers happy however there are aliens mars making landforms and nasa knows this because the time they have taken research this along with the amount pictures taken with high quality cameras and the resemblance the landform landforms earth,699,0.0057224606580829,5

dear state senator the electoral college has been around since the constitution the united states america was composed outdated probably however just because something old does not mean that doesn work anymore why should get rid the electoral college still working and very efficient what does must keep the electoral college keep the voting for the presidency under control the electoral college made electors that means you need least electoral votes win the presidency however there very small chance that tie will occur source two the author states that there was tie the electoral votes the election the president would turn the house representatives and the senate would vote for the vice president each delegate would get one vote the state rhode island would have just much say the state florida since the popular vote does not decide the presidency very possible that the electoral vote doesn side with the popular majority vote however that very rare and only happens maybe once century source three the author stated that when gore had more popular votes than george bush was the first time since that the electoral college didn side with the popular vote very possible but very unlikely there one region that has more electoral votes than the other one region superior the rest the regions the candidates are required travel other regions all regions can see what the candidates campaign and see who the electors will voting for did get rid the electoral college there will consequences for example source three the author stated that only half the population eligible vote will even vote some people vote because they believe that they are the people who decide the presidency the electors are people who want express political view point than just vote just for the sake voting state senator you can see must keep the electoral college rather than switch popular vote for presidency the electoral college was created last forever and far doing just that get rid the electoral college will regret,467,0.006423982869379,3

teaching classroom setting something that has been happening sucessfully for centuries now dating way way back before technology was even being thought about this goes show technolgy not needed but maybe sometimes helpful classroom setting peces technology such has things like computers can super helpful when doing things such writing essay and accessing information online however when taken too advance can become more joke and distraction students that where the facial action coding system comes into play the facial action coding system theoretically seems good idea but reality expensive toy there are many other proven effective ways teach classroom and somethings are boring learn about but you still have know them just sit still relax and learn the first thing you notice when walking into classroom usually the students who are choosing not spend their time wisely rather than the students who are this because students who choose off task are often distracted technolgy and gaming which lot more noticable the human eye these students are taking advantage technology provided and using for bad why would put the facial action coding system schools when expensive and would used toy that right wouldnt when used for other purposes also risk crashing which another thing that would take more time rather than taking that time for the students taught everybody learns different ways for example take the idea studying for spelling test some kids learn writing down multiple times some kids learn hearing being spelled others learn best repeating there are many way for kids learn adding the facial action coding system into schools you assessing kids how much they enjoy what they are learning about and not how much information they are actually gaining which bring next point not every kid going excited about everything they learn yes some books are boring and who wants learn about what cells are made and who cares who invented the lightbulb but these are all things kids are going learn anyways not everything going fun sometimes you just need the facts making kids excited about topic all comes from the influences other people being excited about topic and feeling that positive energy around them computer screen told you you were bored wouldn make you less bored the facial action coding system not all bad there are some good parts about the paysage the author talks about how classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored recognize when student confused powerful thing because when more students are confused they don always like say however the facial action coding system expensive way tell student confused child confused they should say something this allows students build self confidence all all the facial action coding system has both pros and cons however the cons over power the pros making this tool not valuable classroom setting expensive toy that should used for other purposes not say there good uses for the facial action coding system but just not valuable classroom setting,677,0.0132939438700147,5

car free community has many advantages they will reduce the amount greenhouse gases they will also help you save more money not having pay for car and you you can park garage for this will also expand other transportation and will have new six year federal transportation bill there disadvantages for having car free community many countries and cities are participating limiting car usage make the air better and cleaner first and most important that reducing cars also reduces the greenhouse gas emmissions people that participate this are most likely doing make the air breath better some over populated cities the amount smog crazy after just one day without some cars the amount smog disappeared london had the idea for even numbered license plates banned drive one day even though some people still used their cars more than half the cars are still the road and reduced smog much they didn even need ban the odd numbered cars this the most important reason why people are limiting car usage next you live car free community you will never have pay for your car you can sell make more money becuase you will never have use this much better than owning car and having park garage for you ever need take the bus you will have the money with the extra money you can buy bike also the stores will walking distances there need for car think this great idea for not only better community but would help people socialize with neighbors and saves money while doing after world war the cities would start reconstructing around the car but now that begining change vauban germany last the cities are trying expand public transportation such taxis and buses would promote these and play much larger role new six year federal transportation bill previous bills percent appropriations have gone highways law and percent have gone other transportation the city bans cars you can either walk skate bike ride the bus taxi america the amount cars being bought and license plates being bought are decreasing since president obama has ambitious goal which unveiled last week and wants get rid green house gas emmissions conclusion think you would agree that limiting car usage has its advantages reduces greenhouse gases and also smog after one day paris was clear gas and smog the air the gas gets caught under the atmosphere and dangerous limiting car usage also will help you save money because you longer will have car pay for also would boost other forms transportation such buses and taxis this great idea limit cars,603,0.0082918739635157,4

the article the challenge exploring venus the author gives the reader basic insight what venus its history why scientists are trying explore and the challenges scientists have faced overall very informative article and the point was convince the reader that despite all the struggles there that comes with exploring venus that worth exploring anyway though admirable arguement simply not supported throughout this type article the article the author does not support his her argument well because his her informative over kill lack analysis and lack data his her favor begin the author gives too many facts that are simply just introduction paragraph three the whole paragraph stating facts about venus and its atmosphere for example the author states that atmospheric pressure times great than what experience our own planet this does resonate with the arguement considering that about how venus should explored despite the challenges the real problem with this example that this placed the third paragraph and everything before was also facts the author spent three paragraphs talking about the weather venus instead analyzing how should disregarded and should explore for better reasons additionally the author gives facts that have nothing with the arguement provided the second paragraph the author states that sometimes are closer mars and other times venus this simply has nothing with the supposed topic not only there too many facts but these facts have nothing with the topic and the author seems fact trail off bit multiple times additionally the author seems provide analysis towards the plethora information for example the first true analysis seen paragraph five when she states not easy conditions but survivable for humans the time someone writing paragraph five there should already extreme amount noticable analysis before that the basic structure any arguement would state fact and give well thought out analysis about that fact and how applies one topic the noticable structure here would overwhelming amount facts and then slight analysis assuming that the evidence speaks for itself when you have that much information thrown the reader once the evidence really doesn speak for itself that where the supposed analysis comes the analysis supposed connect the dots for the reader and explain how applies seems that lacking here finally the author seems arguing against themselves with the type evidence that being presented throughout the whole article the author seems only stating the things wrong with this idea for example paragraph two the author states that spacecraft survived the landing for than few hours then backed that with analysis how that should worth the risk scientists can can continue exploring this problem because that the point the article that despite all the risks scientists should persevere that not what followed that unsettling fact though all that followed was more facts additionally paragraph six the author finally states good fact how exploration can continue but then follow with analysis that once again goes against the arguement for example after talking about the solution nasa has made this problem the author follow with however peering venus from ship orbiting hovering safely far above the planet can only provide limited insight this was poor choice support because the author basically going against his her idea without reconciling conclusion the author makes unclear which side she trying prove very well written article but only for informational purposes one looking for well supported idea how despite all the risks science should continue this article not the place look anything seems that the author arguing against continuing explore venus considering all the facts and analysis that went against the idea once again this well written informative article not arguable one,856,0.0035046728971962,6

the electoral college process which the electors from the state pick the canidate they want according who has the popular vote which can also very biased process the electoral college not registered monitored enough because elector from the state wanted pick who they want win they could and there isn really anything stop them from doing the people should away with the electoral college and instead switch more regulated system like majority voting whichever canidate that gets the most votes from the takes the win that way wouldnt have worry about our electors for the states being sneaky because there wont any electors state legislature responsible for picking the electors and the electors sometimes defy the will the people and cast the vote for who they want win just like when richard nixon only validated his opponents electors the electoral college would more just way voting the electors were well monitored and every state shared the same weight the vote but unfortunately not like that needs done away with the electoral college unrestricted and very poorly regulated process and very unfair process because the winner take all system voters voted different way the election would have been deadlocked roughly voters ohio and about voters hawaii had voted for different person the election would have been tie and usually the bigger states are the only ones actually see their candidates because the candidates dont necessarily visit states with very few electoral votes because they wont help them much instead they visit the swing states the states that have bigger weight the presidential election however the other side the people that want keep are the ones that look the few good things not the bad things those helpful things that comes with the electoral college majorly decreases the chance run off election which canidate receives majority the votes cast the electoral college also puts out certainty outcome because there less likely dispute over the outcome popular vote then dispute over electoral college vote course life there always least some good things like the electoral college but this situation does more harm then good overall unfair process because some states are less noticed because how few electoral votes they hold and also because the electors not being monitored the vote they cast for their state the electoral college should doen away with and united country shall adopt more fair equal and all together well monitored system voting,538,0.0167286245353159,4

dear senator believe that the way our elections are run are not what best for the united states the electoral college changing the way that originally set out vote and making things unfair for the citizens who vote propose that the electoral college taken away all together order for elections more fair and more like the original intention the with most states following the winner takes all idea the winner the general public may not the candidate that wins the elections these times are rare but they happened before there nothing that stopping them from happening again lot voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college what they are actually voting for when they vote instead voting for the candidate that they want the next president they are voting for group electors that decide who will win sometimes the electors that are assigned that candidate will not vote for them this process also seems discriminate against the less populated states because they don have much say the college and are often forgotten the rush propaganda and aren really aware who they should pick and why they should pick them the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong bradford plumer plumer explains that one the best arguments against the electoral college that the rate disaster high there was electoral crisis based upon the electoral college because gore recieved more individual votes but george bush still won the election another reason that this process unstable the way that makes voters feel about voting large states where this majority either republican democrats voters may think that they are the minority and the other party will surely win the election what the point voting there was electoral college the votes that they put could contribute the greater pool that parties voters while with electoral college the votes are pointless and basically disappear that robbing the citizens the thir right vote according richard posner the electoral college restores some the weight that the large states hold presidental election however the large states may not have all one party and those other votes can really make difference some argue that few votes can not lot and that the electoral college far more organized way conduct the voting but every vote counts and every voter understood why they were voting for who they were voting for then the president may majority favorite seems unfair that the president the united states the most important man the country not truely picked the voters but the electoral college the office the federal register says that the electors that are selected are chosen the candidates political party but that stae laws differ how they are specifically selected this way does not seem like the best way performing the task and can see how results issues trusting the weight the united stated the the backs iof only electors not the most stable way perform election why trust select group with this decison the whole united states can contribute think that critically that change the idea electoral college the idea that all the people the united states are able contribute equally who should the next president based what they believe right bradford plummer believes that one the most worrying thoughts that there will tie with the electors that were occur the election would fall into the hands the house representatives resulting all the states matter what their population having the same amount votes casing president that may very far away than what the majority the united states actually wants this may seem unlikely but fact there have already been many close calls only votes would have deadlocks the election tie would have happened voters hawaii and voters hawaii had voted the other way the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong bradford plummer tie may occur and does lot citizens would very upset that the president did not win popularity but the electoral college there are many reasons that the electoral college unfair the voters the state inequality diaster ties and people loosing the urge vote the list goes and and this doesn make you see what wrong with this system than don know what will hope you take this information good use and use tear down this unfair system once and for all really want democracy than have away with this system many americans believe that this the best way and several have published interesting papers that topic that may chang the minds people who are still for hope this dream get rid the unfair and terrible system that the electoral college accomplished soon sincerely concerned citizen,1059,0.0151085930122757,6

has anyone ever actually seen alien believe have reason believe this supposed face was created them the face just natural landform because can even pick out the face aliens are most likely not even real and looks like natural build sand dirt can even see the face the face mars looks like any normal pile hardened dirt sand from what can tell this face isn even face more like when you see crack the sidewalk and pick out cool design making seem like something not with your imagination aliens probably don even exist one has ever seen one why should believe aliens created all even did just happen aliens they probably weren intelligent enough create face the pile looks like natural build sand dirt stuff like that happens all the time with hardened dirt sand whether accident choice doesn make any sense all personally those are thoughts just because aliens haven been found yet doesn mean they don exist while this true also have evidence that aliens are real therefore this means there chance they still don exist all which just much chance that they the face mars probably just something that formed accident because there really point all which brings the question even was aliens and face what reason would they have this that isn something that can explained which why just natural landform can even see the face aliens probably don exist and looks like natural build hardened sand and dirt,389,0.0,2

that not face the picture from the viking from rather like the scientists nasa say natural landform yes know looks like face but reality not technically you really can say from alien life form because scientists and astronauts haven found evidence life mars yet conspiracy theorists say nasa trying hide the truth from when actually they want you know the truth otherwise they didn want you know the truth they wouldn have put the picture out the first place there are lot statistics and facts that obviously point the truth and going explain all them you first the other and newer pictures the obvious comparison landforms earth and why your brain thinks sees face first all obviously not face because the newer pictures that were taken the same thing show different thing you might wonder how can show different thing but still the same thing well the newest picture from was taken with much better camera the picture clearer and the fact that this natural landform finally the pictures are the most important clue that the face natural landform that how the pictures tell that the face landform secondly you compare landforms earth the face pictures you get similar pictures for example you take picture the middle butte the snake river plain idaho from above and compare the picture they look identical that according cheif scientist for nasa mars exploration program stated that the face reminds him the most the middle butte the snake river plain idaho finally when and you get the chance you should compare the face other landforms earth that how comparing landforms earth the face can provide evidence you that the face natural landform lastly your brain somewhat tricks you into seeing face but don worry because natural when you look the first picture you most likely going see face even see face kind get excited about discovering another life form and start jump conclusions don think there something wrong with that because there not long you have evidence support but this case you don furthermore the reason are brain tricks into seeing face our dna for example from when you were born everytime you looked the mirror looked somebody else you saw face the reason why you always see face because our brain has been hard wired recognize face that how our brains trick into seeing face conclude those are all the clues reasons why your brain sees and thinks the first picture face when actually natural landform called mesa recap the comparison the first picture the picture can show that mesa next the comparison landforms earth the face can show you mesa those are clues that can prove you that the face mesa basically all you have compare different things the face finally the reason why your brain tricks you into seeing face instead mesa because everybody brain has been hard wired recognize face that why when you look the first picture you see face instead what really mesa finally sometimes all you have find the truth dig and look deeper and you discover the truth that why say the face the first picture actually indeed mesa,735,0.0027210884353741,4

the matter the electoral college being either abolished kept intact take the side keeping intact for the reason that even though you are technically not voting for the president but for slate delegates that are loyal the candidate fact very useful first the number electoral votes are given the population each state and second there near certainty outcome because the winner take all system begin with the electoral college based the population the state meaning that the bigger the state population the more electoral college representatives they get california has the biggest population the and the district columbia has the smallest then isn fair that they get the same number votes either small nor large because there are more people one state then the other although people say that the electoral college bad thing and think that anarchism not for one the things that keep our country near perfect shape another reason that the electoral college should kept that there near certainty outcome take the election between obama and romney where obama recieved the electoral vote compared the popularity vote cast him people argue that the electoral college has diaster factor that the system allows for much more happen that doesn thats the problem hasn happened and most likely won happen because were going happen then would already happened and congress wouldbe revised and made sure that didnt happen that could delayed that solution was made possible and that the election went continued conclude even though the electoral college has many flaws that are yet shown and fixed the only way have elect presidents and thats how should because you can have perfect thing without flaws that have fixed,409,0.0146699266503667,3

cars are not something that have used everyday limiting car usage could good thing minimizing car usage gives you the opportunity have more parks and fun places without the parking lot taking all the space less space for parking makes everything more easier get which advantage instead having walk the parking lot for example make suburbs more compact and more accessible public transportation with less space for parking german suburb life goes without cars elisabeth rosenthal paragraph this explains that you get rid the cars theres more space park and everything else becomes easier get versus having many parking spaces taking room and causing traffic and other things also with not using cars theres more room for small stores and big stores put different places that couldnt put there because cars you could drive for example stores are placed walk away main street rather than malls along some distant highway german suburb life goes without cars elisabeth rosenthal paragraph and parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced broad smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped car free day spinning into big hit bogota andrew selsky paragraph this shows that now there more spaces for even more stores which advantage because the cars used take that space used for bigger roads for more cars come but without that problem theres room for other thing also good way save money because decreases smog and air pollution for example congestion was down percent the capital france after five days intensifying smog paris bans driving due smog robert duffer paragraph this shows that after france decided stop using cars the smog decreased tremendously having vehicles can also make the environment better because there wouldnt lot carbon being produced for example will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment the end car culture elisabeth rosenthal paragraph which example how could better for the environment advantage also there will less pollution for example good opportunity take away stress and lower air pollution this explains that would good thing for would have better breathing and also again better environment conclusion minimizing driving usage could lead better things such less pollution better environment and lastly more room for other things theyre are many advantages minimizing driving usage not bad,580,0.0086206896551724,4

the facial action coding system facs not useful appropriate the classroom paragraph describes that computers basically watch your face see what ads use and could used the classroom see what you understand however not likely that teacher would want for their lesson altered because that can create some problems having computer scanning your face could also viewed kind wrong and invasive the other hand people knew they were being watched they could easily change the appearance their emotion people can very convincing lastly technology not correct the time things could always glitch and change things for the worse some might view the concept computer scanning your face every time you are front its camera minimally invasive everyone has different facial expressions that show different things and could mean the complete opposite what the computer views paragraph describes that computer can scan your face see there that you don like and show less ads like that one not only does that have nothing with using classroom but one likes ads the first place and you have pay get them removed also some teachers like try and read their student get feel how their day see they living their best life while this sometimes very sweet sometimes people like left alone when they mood this technology could literally increase the percentage teachers being people business they already have that dyno app that screen records all our screen they can see what doing all times why would they need know how feeling well actress and show choir student can safely say that the performing arts community can definitely put facade others may not either those activities however people can still very convincing personally knew was being watched probably fake some emotions people shows like grey anatomy and law and order are paid put fake face their job literally fake for camera there are episodes those shows where people are crying and they look very pained chances are they are not really feeling those emotions arizona robins may have cheated callie torres but jessica capshaw didn cheat sara ramirez that fake emotion they might not their character they have play that part and convincing they don get the part show choir there are songs where have angry and then suddenly happy and then concerned all matter sixteen counts and can that then can change how portray our emotions when are being watched camera there are many different applications and softwares tha are the world now and matter how advanced the technology may never always perfectly running even the latest technology glitches from time time technology constantly updating and changing due bugs the software technology like this could ruin something completely everyone has focus face that they put when they reading something solving equation let say someones focus face looks little bit angry just because their face looks angry does not mean that they don like the question don like how taught explained just means that they focused what they doing the software misreads facial expression and changes what the screen could completely mess what the student doing the student does need the way teaching adjusted and does change could cause problems with the teacher because some teachers want things done very specific way something happens with the software and could inconvenience the student many ways conclusion facial action coding system should not put classrooms not completely useless but not very useful either people don need their face read see how they feel about about teaching style that why surveys were invented someone wanted people know hawo they felt every time they turned computer they start blog there are really bad actors this planet but there are lot liars and pretenders lot people knew they were being recorded and faked smile because they think that their privacy stake would completely defeat the purpose the system and would all for not technology also very expensive these days and this type thing can easily hacked could glitch and once again defeat the purpose the system,964,0.0062240663900414,6

the electoral college has been used for years agree that must keep this way yes possible that the outcome the popular vote that the people have chosen not agreement but has been the best way selecting president highly unlikely that when the people vote for certain selection the candidates group electors will change their mind has happened before but rare suggest that the electoral college stay and not change the election because has not only been used for years but also some the citizens may make mistake who they vote for and atleast with the electoral college can make sure have the right president each candidate has their own electors and take electoral votes choose president and since they are from the same group they wouldn choose someone else has happened says the excerpt this system has been used for years why change now the electoral college has worked this way for years the founding fathers came with good process completely fair all the people get select their candidate and the electors know what their responsibilities are the citizens aren completely able control the electors ideas but they might have bit more knowledge the subject some citizens may get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate excerpt from passage this refers the fact that may have chaos let the people decide directly who our president need insider review our peoples choices and make sure that the correct one and what better way than have the electoral college depends the state and the candidate political party which you chose the people will get what they asked for their has been times which that not always the case but the electors usually make the decision the people has asked for said the passage defense the electoral collage each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the party nominee and the trust rarely betrayed this system the best one yet our people are well informed but not always take out the electoral college are leaving our country their hands and people make mistakes sometimes with the electoral college have various people making the right decision like when author writes book they don get published right away they have people make sure their spelling correct and they make many other different corrections the same with the electoral college and the way the president selected state senator suggest keep this system,546,0.0054945054945054,4

just straight facs anybody can read room whether party important meeting funeral pre calculus lesson easy look around and see how the people around you are feeling due body language and facial expression others don think though prof thomas huang and his team experts have come with new tech that can recognize all muscles the human face and create diagnostic how person feeling this interesting yes but some may think that this technology could used classrooms get general feel what each student feeling about lesson believe that using the facs facial action coding system classroom setting would have merit and would just waste time and money public schools across america because how weak the technology the facs actually the text huang says that facial expressions for each emotion are universal and that varying degrees expression can still used recognize the feelings and emotions any human being when applying this classroom enviroment this can correct that due many natural factors humans for example the world has progressed lot and more children with mental disabilities and special needs are being allowed involved regular classes for student with form autism may hard for them convey certain emotions regular basis the technology wouldn able read their face correctly another example for student with physical disability whose face couldn read properly the facs there are too many outliers for the technology accurate unless you had room children who all express their emotions like open book the text also says that most human communications are nonverbal agree with this statement actually proves that one can never tell what person thinking just what they say their facial expressions the only true place you can know how somebody really feels their mind for one never really say express how feel about school infront any sort teacher staff general rule among students school olt talk about teachers lessons outside the classroom now this may not how other public school settings happened though then the facs technology would obsolete its purpose lastly paragraph the text says that according the facial feedback theory emotion putting face poker face actually trains your body better mood this means that literally anyone could trick the facs into thinking that they were happy mood when need students could easily beat the system manipulating the facs into giving off false diagnostic every time and therefore ruining the facs creditability until the facs can tell when group teenagers are faking their emotions can perform its main task conclusion huang facs technology can not work due how baseless ethics are how difficult really understand emptions just facial expression and how easy manipulate process,657,0.0045662100456621,4

although you have made good points concerning the landform mars would like respectfully disagree your opinion that aliens are responsible for the building cydonia the passage unmasking the face mars the author has quotes comparing the face cydonia natural landforms earth such mountains and messias through the passage and its comparisons can infer that the face mars face just made natural causes and the impact the weather you really think and dig deeper the picture the face could resemble mountains small hills posted positioned relatively close together that the image face possible lastly the reason why cydonia fact just landform the way that the author writes the passage nasa very briefly mentions the possible outcome aliens but other than that nothing else has been said about the could creatures they must not firm believers which leads the conclusion that nasa had discovered aliens wouldn that make them most popular the discovery new life would without doubt absolutely fantastic for nasa and its image the thought that there might life mars good enough situation lie and say that you did find life only have your buisness the tabloids can all infer that nasa had discovered that cydonia had been built aliens american citizens would the first know you cant hide something like this that would make your buisness sucessful conclusion can infer that cydonia fact landform some sort the face mars know this through the discussion that landforms are built with natural causes not aliens and that the face were built aliens wouldn hidden from citizens knowing that the discovery could boom multiple businesses,376,0.0292553191489361,3
technology that able read your facial expression sounds pretty cool until isn technology like this does not seem very useful schools think that technology like this actually waste time because can embarass someone school cause problem with friends school and some people dont want others know what they are feeling being embarassed school for feeling certain way can cause bullying school some the much older may think the person weak are soft for having being told what emotion was read yes you may saying well would also read their emotions too but they might not care the bullying could get worse with their feelings being read aout loud foe example lets say kid was being bullied for the machine saying was feeling sad and the bullies are messing with him could get angry and cause the problem become worse then already was the machine says feeling angry while his bullies are around him friendships could torn apart from this too friends feel certain way about each other they may feel like the other nuisance and dont see them friend now imagine that being said you machine and this causes your friends get made you can pit strain lot relationships like when someone around thier girlfriend boyfriend the machine can say bad interpretation what that person was trying say some people may not want their feelings read out them they may going through alot pain and stress their life that they are becoming suicide its really not got thinking about suicide especially when this could teenager child when their class they may feeling wierd about themselves and for someone being able find out pretty nerve racking you might saying yourself well this means could prevent suicide adolescents well that true they might not want people find out they might want deal with their own which tough thing through problems like these are reasons that this technology not important valuable school its actually problem for the school also depends the buget not all schools will able afford even though technology flourishing and becoming more common places around the world some things like human behavior and emotions should left alone something that makes who are,485,0.0103092783505154,3

believe that should change the system election popular vote were change the way elect our president sure citizens would more pleased with the over all outcome people vote who they think best fit represent them and give them the best over all outcome when using the electoral college you are not voting for the president but you are voting for state electors would easier simply allow presidents get the popular vote order make the election more fair all around the electoral college unfair voters because the winner take all system time change our voting methods because the electoral college system outdated irrational and unfair citizens when people place their vote they belive they are putting vote for the president they choose not for slate electors the electoral college very non democratic way selecting your president way the government deceiving their citizens the way our voting method set when people vote they feel sense independence because they are allowed choose who they would like represent them congress but instead once they place their vote goes electors rather than simple vote towards the one they selected you were change the way people votes were counted would easier and faster elect president and get him into office fix world wide problems all three articles least one section has made clear their opinion abolish the electoral college figures such richard nixon jimmy carter and even the chamber commerce have agreed abolishing the electoral college when voting for president you are voting for slate electors but even know who these supposed electors are are votes are being manipulated and are not even aware who doing can not vote for are president without going through electors should able vote for the electors who are voting for are president only fair that have some say everything that going when votes are being placed should informed all that going you were vote for your favorite show but your vote had through twenty different people all with different opinions you would frustrated now imagine that scenario but with something extremely more significant than televison show the president you are trusting possibly the next four years your life with strangers which you have never heard before would only fair could simply change the system popular vote rather than electoral college you switch popular vote more people would more likely vote because they could have more confidence about their vote they would feel free make their own decision and trust would not tampered with stranger people deserve fair vote and with the popular vote that what you are giving them because every living being deserves equality changing the system would not only helpful for citizens but helpful for the congress instead having random members congress choose the president they can work serious issues around the world they can stop worrying about foolishness and their jobs conclusion changing the way people vote easier for everybody saves time for electors and gives people chance see who they are really voting for presidents would have each state and appeal them order get vote belive that what need they would required actually work for position office rather than speaking what they are going and paying someone else elect them should have faith our president and know who are voting for before cast our vote this system seems more fair and more modern the twenty first century this system most americans would agree with end argument simply say think before you act and truly try whats right,793,0.0012610340479192,4

profoundly believe that the united states should not keep the electoral college because the person who has the popular vote may not win presidency and the winner take all system causes voters certain states not feel like they are creating impact the electoral college process that the founding fathers established the constition the electoral college consists electors and majority votes our voting system even candidate receives more votes than their opponents she still could lose the election because the electoral college here prime example the election gore won the popular vote but because had less electoral votes than bush unfortunately lost the election according bradford plumer over voters would prefer direct election the kind have now seems rather logical that somebody gains the most votes election that the country would prefer that canidate the president for that reason alone the reader should side with the idea abolish the electoral college now besides somebody receiving more less electoral votes perhaps the candidates tied this case gets thrown the house representatives which will cause wyoming rep with voters have just much say california rep with voters all tie would corrupt the voting system even more than for those reasons there should indefinite ban the electoral college additionally the winner take all method some states makes voters feel unimportant some may argue that region has enough electoral votes elect president but regions have the power swing election enormous way effect the winner take all system candidates not going certain states they know they can not win this can basically stop some voters from wasting time and voting because they may feel there personal vote would make difference the election states did not see candidates all according bradford plumer how could somebody possibly feel engaged election whoever running finds there vote unimportant them winning the election conclusion official that the electoral collage unfair out dated and irrational with that being said should abolish because stops the voter who has the majority votes from winning and can undoubtably make voters feel unimportant,463,0.0107991360691144,4

think that facial action coding system would good thing have schools would help teachers figure out what would more fun and interesting for the kids learn without them falling asleep day dreaming you had back school would you rather write paper watch video something you liked was interested other then something you hate doing would much easier stay focused and task when think school dont find fun something looking forward going but they could give assignments that liked and had fun doing then everything would easier for the students and the teachers would have less stress alot teachers can already tell that some students dont want school and they can tell there grades but who wouldnt want come school was actually fun interesting they could use the computers for when they give essays videos watch they noticed you didnt like the topic then they could change and find something the whole class likes not just one person they could also use know what subjects need could use help yea think its little creepy have something looking you but can help get your grades and could get you better job the future why not they could know what work sheets are harder then others and see what they need cover class more alot students dont like sitting class reading book that they dont find interesting because they get bored and tired listening and then they slack off and shows there grades states the artifical that you smile when web appears the screen similar might fallow but you frown the next will different this could help all the boring time you have spend watching adds commerical you were interested then then you would have better experience and you would more likley buy the item and you didnt like the then they wouldnt show and would something els think that they should put facs classrooms that the teachers could help there students more personal way also would better for the students learn about the software they might have use the future they start using think there would major change schools around evansville and would help out many people get jobs later life they could also use many different ways the everyday life,524,0.0171755725190839,3

technology can not tell you about someones emotions the closest thing that the lie detector test and not even that percent correct because very easy beat the system just slowing down your breathing tricking your mind into thinking your right same thing with this facial action coding system you smile picture but your really actually sad then this system will most likely think your happy from the smile not even people can tell someone how they feel because the only one who truly knows how you feel you obviously technology right somewhat most the time but this system doesnt seem like would anywhere near possible there would ways make this test better though like when you use lie detector they put sensors your pulses maybe you used the same thing this test would give somewhat more realistic calculation over time this system will most likely get better but the state its now doesnt seem very reliable,198,0.0,2
currently live world dependent machines becoming more and more enveloped this idea reliance however now have reached point where that reliance harming and our planet and will continue don adjust our lifestyles seeing that recently reached that point realization are starting limit ourselves the things that harm our planet including limiting the usage cars living the twentieth century almost inevitably means relying cars for transportation although may seem impossible convince many pursue this act limiting the usage cars surely not impossible seen from the recent efforts made around the world will take time adjust the drastic change but the benefits are worth the while few the many advantages include the conservation our valuable space improving the quality our environment and allowing for the opportunity new ideas developments and change the first the advantages may not the first you would think yet certainly important one limiting our use cars would save and replenish our amount space that currently have available not only the cars themselves that take space but also the space left for street parking the big cities the massive parking garages used shopping malls and the driveways and garages the houses large suburban neighborhoods this method limiting the use cars been successfully applied town germany known vauban vauban residents this upscale community are suburban pioneers going where few soccer moms commuting executives have ever gone before they have given their cars german suburb life goes without cars the town vauban has given their areas street parking driveways and home garages limit almost entirely their use cars with the removal all traces automobile usage some may concerned about how they are expected reach their desired destinations but vauban and many other places preparing the follow this plan stores will placed walk away main street rather than malls along some distant highway german suburb life goes without cars although some may concerned with the potential limit their car usage they must reminded that the space originally used for cars will certainly not waste and will used for bigger and better purposes that will not harm our planet this second advantage the one most associated with the limit put our use cars the improved quality the environment the environment can improved with the decrease greenhouse gas emissions which turn improves the quality the air that surrounds our president barack obama has ambitious goals curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions the end car culture but that can only done with the cooperation the citizens fortunately that cooperation has been seen with the fortuitous assist from incipient shift american behavior which recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses each year goes the end car culture understood professionals that the pattern continues will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation the second largest source america emissions the end car culture although some may reluctant pursue the path limiting their use cars they should well informed that doing they are improving their overall state living not producing these harmful properties that are being released into the air that breathe this last advantage most likely the most considerably accepted the public because its simplicity their part and the benefits they recieve from with the limit put the use cars that allows for the opportunity new ideas developments and change the idea

venus planet were scientism are exploring see they can create another earth therefore they have than some experiments see how long things can survive there are many good reason why studding venus worthy one the reasons because venus the closest planet earth venus still has some features that are alike earth and solar power would plentiful venus the closest planet earth which can advantage because could have more population and more place travel and see different types culture the text says that venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closest distance too this mavens that the other planets are further than venus text also says that venus can sometimes our nearest option for planetary visit this telling that have more option visit the planet venus looks more alike earth than you think some scientist belive that venus had larges amounts water the text states that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth this shows that this why scientist are exploring this specific planet because look very alike earth text also says that the planet unus has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such valleys mountains and craters shows how similar this planets are another advantage that venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system according the text says that solar power would plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels this could help not using electronics else the materials would melt one important fact that spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours but scientism are working hard they say that won easy conditions but would survival for humans there happens life venus the temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit,405,0.0246913580246913,4

not believe that should have driverless cars first off think they would more dangerous then they would helpful the article said that humans would still have control over the car when needed but for the most part the cars can sort drive itself imagine going down high way and there crash says that needs help maneuvering around objects like that well what would happen you were not paying attention because you believe that the car can drive itself you might looking something else messing with the radio and someone wrecks front you you don really notice though because you are not watching paying your full attention the road since the car needs human touch around that and you wasn paying attention you would most likely wreck also not only kind more dangerous but also sort irrelevent don you think after all these years have been fine with normal cars that what they are made for they are made for humans get around much faster and travel further distances there need have car that drives its self none all kind lazy humans have everything that need and can travel the world but people only want they don have drive too hard for them push down pedal guess not believe would cause less accidents either there could many different things that could wrong electrically and could get someone killed takes years before they have perfected and even then there would some kinks work out see few upsides though maybe people were too get drunk would alot safer for them not drive and the car find way home without human telling where there may few upsides but there are way many down sides consider this option would kind have change all the roads how drive when and how old have get self drivable car they will also much more expensive sure and there will people that can afford them would have change all rules and everything don think worth say just keep how because has been the same for years and has been working for alright,501,0.0019960079840319,4

think leaning more the positives driverless cars mean also think could bad idea for many reasons but gon na for them like dad always said wishes that could have car that could drive itself now his dream could possibly come true dont think would fully trust the fact that the car controlling itself but still for here are reasons why would trust driverless car more than would trust some these idiots driving the road today this could also help with the whole texting and driving drinking and driving which not saying now you can those things but your car will drive itself dont have work about that person hitting and killing another person plus they put alot effort and great hardware into these vehicles but none these cars are completely driverless they have touch sensors the steering wheel make sure the driver keeps hold the wheel think would very cool experience drive car that can steer accelerate and brake their own once again dont fully trust this idea but willing the positives before the negatives like how the driver wants take over all the mechanics that the car doing itself shut off instantly you can take over that would make feel whole lot more comfortable car that drives itself says the law that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has human driver control all time that has something with the release these new cars they just have prove that these cars can safe the road then manufacturers believe that more states will follow open this new and cool idea but disagree with this idea the fact that could dangerous the text states the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer not going jail for life for something had control over all all think that this idea neat would very fascinating see they really operate well but like said also kind disagree with this driverless car thing because that technology fails then what happens they prove the safety and hardware make safe then and pretty sure dad will too,494,0.0141700404858299,4

there has been theories and plans for driverless cars for the future scientists have been researching for many years trying find way where cars drive themselves that day has finally came certain extent these driverless cars still need the assistance humans these cars can not fully drive themselves the new technology that people are putting into cars just does not seem like very well thought out idea anything could happen these driverless cars eyes and probably many other eyes there should not such thing where cars drive themselves like said before anything can happen these driverless cars well that true for instance there could malfunction somewhere the technology when person driving the interstate and potentially harm that person many other people these cars have sensors all around them they also have dubbed lidar see image everything that happening and sense when they are close object not what some those sensors broke something happened the sensors where they could not detect anything that person could possibly get injured really bad even put other people state driverless cars can very dangerous people and their surroundings another problem with these cars who will liable there happened accident would the driver the manufacturer that one thing that has yet determined there has been multiple different design plans for these driverless cars some them involved putting dubbed lidar and sensors all around and the car others have involved running electrical cables through roads that sent radio signals receiver the front end the car just all sorts different ideas but how are people going pay for these driverless cars how are scientists going provide the cost for these cars and run electrical cables through every single road going outrageous construct all those ideas nobody the right mind going want pay for car that only drives itself certain aspects and that can not guarantee their safety when driving many thoughts and ideas about these driverless cars are genius who would not want car that could drive itself these cars can steer accelerate and brake themselves driving the car still needs human access but not like would these cars could these things driverless cars could change the world know but there are certain restrictions that need solved first these driverless cars can help some could harm others anything could happen the car that could potentially harm that person other people the liability factor the car big risk the car malfunctions would the drivers fault nobody wants deal with that there are many cons this idea self driving cars until scientists somebody figures out how make those problems less dangerous more reliable people are not going think that driverless cars will start change the world,608,0.0049342105263157,4

dear state senator experience strongly believe that you should get rid the electoral college popular vote you that the votes would become fair voters and more voters would actually pay attention the campine the other hand see why you would want keep the electoral college but let explain you two the many reasons why you should get rid first people argue that the electoral college does pay attention some the regiment voters plumer article says thanks the quirks the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over percent voters would prefer direct election the voters who like the electoral college pretty much just want see that they can trust them just for the popular votes succeed but honestly think they still shouldn the ones choose even they may help the popular votes little they aren fair lot ways way more voters are against them than with let explain one reasons believe you should get rid the electoral college because isn fair voters lot the time voters don trust that the electoral college pays attention the votes sent out acording plumer article the indefensible electoral college states the same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please when voters hear that chaos starts they want have say for who the next president will not just the electoral college say there have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based what they believe and not other voters for example hawaii the vice president richard nixon validated his opponents votes voters worry and get angry when there trust broken they want the ones vote because course they trust themselves you get rid the electoral college voters would more satisified and feel that their vote would fair lastly the second reason why believe that getting rid the electoral college that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought who they vote they think that their vote won matter they won care who wins they would most likely jot down random candidate and send the article defense the electoral college posner states republicans california knowing their vote will have effect they have less incentive pay attention the campaign than they would have the president were picked popular vote with that said there support that states people would have beter interest voting they had popular vote and more electoral college believe people would actually spend more their time debating who should deserve president conclude reasons please take them consideration voters would treated much fairly and pay more attention voting than they now believe you should get rid the electoral college there will less arguing sincere proper name,644,0.0062111801242236,5

voting one the hardest choices person has make because reality the votes for the american pesident can decided one two votes sometimes the two deciding factors voting are the electoral college and the popular vote the people they both make the elections fair but also unfair without one the whole election process would not good today the electoral college comprised total electors and elect president you need majority votes from the this electoral college comprised one vote for each representative from your state plus two for the senators obviously this gives every state fair chance vote but even lets say hawaii north dakota and south dakota wanted republican and texas wanted democrat texas votes would cancel out the others because the amount representatives they have compared the other three states this one thing that makes this form voting very unfair obviously smart give homestate more representatives because their population but that completely defeats the purpose making fair because the small states stand chance against the densely populated ones like florida texas california and new york the popular vote the percentage votes that the president recieve form the people citizens that are voting for them the popular vote does not haver much effect the electoral college but still does make effect for example when gore had the popular vote but did not win the presidency because george bush had the majority the electoral college this when the popular vote should more emphasized because obviously the people which over about million wanted gore but the electoral college vote more than only people wanted bush that issue but also some people voting don really understand what the two people are offering and just vote because one sounds better looks cooler your friends are voting for him her this why the popular voting system can not fully trusted the compare the two topics not one better than the other and not one can function without the other perspective was smart the founding fathers create both systems that the voting would somewhat fair reality even though the popular vote doesn make difference can persuade the representatives the state change their mind can make them realize that they are making the right decision because how their state chosing vote this should change their mind because the people elected them knowing that they will vote for who they promised vote for and will most likely stay true their state and their party conclusion both system are great together but apart can not funciona the founding fathers and leaders this country can not blamed for making this system because there really way make fair and they did their best now think you were design the voting system for the united states america what woul you differently the same,594,0.0134680134680134,3

imagine world with less vehicles due restriction vehicle usage and when say restriction use the term loosely don mean completely banishing automobiles just limiting their usage that means less hassle and less hurry although some would argue some would say that would great inconvenience limit vehicle use however there are many advantages that would come with many places around the globe have already began limit motor vehicle usage and they have found that there are many benefits doing according article called german suburb life goes without cars elisabeth rosenthal vauban germany has already begun give their vehicles you know why this such good idea well first all would bring vast reduction pollution and decrease the the amount the greenhouse effect the atmosphere causing healthier environment for everyone also there would less fatalities caused car accidents not only that but most people would saving lot money that usually spent fuel for their vehicle many regions suffer from nasty polluted air called smog that very unhealthy inhale especially when people have take breath every second every day smog form pollution caused intense carbon emissions article called paris bans driving due smog robert duffer they began fine people for using thier vehicles certain days prevent and decrease smog probably the most significant effect limiting vehicle usage reduces pollution given off from gasoline and diesel engines through vehicle tailpipe drastically decreasing the amount carbon emissions which would lower the greenhouse effect the atmosphere including smog causing healthier environment for every species enjoy many injuries and deaths caused car accidents occur ever day innocent civilians walking riding bicycle and families with children car get killed vehicle accidents all the time this could avoided adding limits driving could save many lives less fatalities due accidents perhaps drastically decreased injury and death rates lot people would save money that they usually spend fuel for their vehicles some people drive work and spend half the money they earned that day gasoline people carpooled walked rode bike used public transportation they would not spend much their money gas have explained there are many positive effects society from limiting car usage pollution reduction avoided deaths injuries and money saving are all very good reasons change our ways transportation why not,524,0.0019083969465648,3

people over the years that have been talking about cars that drive themselves have found this topic very interesting because the phrase cars that drive themselves yes sounds interesting and very cool and far into the future but there are downsides this idea and there are some good sides depends the people that you ask because some could say way then there are some that could say yes way then you have think this way are these futuristic cars even safe for humans driverless cars sound really cool because then you don really need anything but sit back and watch then again just don think that would want car that drives itself only because the dangers kind puts you for example the passage states that these cars have all these sensors that can keep you safe while you driving well what you while that car driving and one the sensors malfunctions and there car running stop sign while your turn what you you won even see the car coming from the side you and that sensor malfunctioned can alert the car then you get smacked into the other vehicle these cars come with very dangerous factors and possibilities that can happen any given moment yes these cars are cool but would never get one for myself paragraph two when talks about how television and movies have been fascinated with cars that drive themselves think can bad thing for them doing that that because the way movies and portray the driverless cars unreal but others who don understand that well they could good amount danger for example the movie transformers every single one those cars drive themselves they steer themselves they can open their own doors they can all this stuff and someone who actually believes that that what these manufacturers are coming out with then they are wrong because they think that will able that stuff and while they distracted boom they just got boned another driver because the person wasn paying attention these cars could really cause lot danger society driverless cars are way too dangerous feel like people would irresponsible with them and cause harm the community against cars that drive themselves for right now until they can poove that these cars are safe like all know today there are crazy drivers out there and with them the road with car like this that could put ton people danger help prove whole point paragraph says that the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer well here the thing said the technology fails that means that there chance the technology failing and causing harm just like lot other technology can for example some sort saw cut wood metal one those things malfunctions and blade goes flying could hit someone and easily kill them not all technology fool proof that why wouldn trust this driverless car once again not support the creation one these driverless vehicles because safety issue even this car does have all these sensors that doesn mean that totally safe because you still have all these other crazy drivers the road that could potentially smack into they aren paying attention even you aren paying attention yes the movies these cars look really cool but don think that they need created and brought into real life say that just stick what already that having actual people drive the car instead having computer programmed into the car driving now know people don drive either but what the technology fails and someone dies crash then what you you definitely can blame the person for something that company made malfunctioning the people just need stop and think about what all could happen you let computer drive your two three ton vehicle,870,0.0034482758620689,5

the planet venus has the potential for being great place visit and for sending people there too while has some dangerous conditions scientists have come with solution oversee the planets atmosphere according nasa the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth this information shows that possible for people not live venus but live above without being harmed astronomers have been studying venus for long time and they believe that the planet once had life makes even more sense for this true venus one the closest planets the earth according the author venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth not only that but has large rocky surface with hills mountains and valleys with all the advanced technology have todays world scientists can also find several ways reduce the pressure and harsh conditions this makes even more safe study further into the planet itself there are many ways could think make sure that venus safe and reliable planet but many people still wonder this amazing idea nasa can send people the moon and send machine mars than who says can the same with this gas planet this discovery could great change the world,324,0.0,3

the article the challenge exploring venus the author does not support the idea that studying venus worthy pursuit despise the dangers presents states that worthy pursuit study but the beginning starts listing off the reasons why haven done before the text states each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the last trip was more than three decades ago but the landscape itself not safe the temperatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the pressure times greater than earth put that into respective says that the environment would crush even submarine accustomed diving the deepest parts our oceans and would liquify many metals that kind environment would extremely hard get especially study the environment dangerous from the pressure temperature and the fact that there are erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes nasa has been developing possible solutions these risks maybe should think them challenges the author wrote one possible solution would allow scientists float above the fray one the problems with this such solution that the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere prevent depth scientific discovery and any sort collection rocks gases this scenario they would have limited vision and temperatures about degrees fahrenheit this not easy conditions but survivable for humans according the author survivable but they have limited vision and can not collect anything study unless they alter their plans and place themselves far more danger nasa working other approaches studying venus such some simplified electronics which when placed conditions simulating venus have lasted for three weeks such conditions they looked older technology well some dating back towards world war the author the article speaks about these things development but gives information how they could used the devices were used like probe getting past the frequent lightning strikes probes seeking land its surface would another added difficulty the challenge exploring venus the article does not support the idea studying venus despite dangers very well talks about the dangers and possible solutions but never what they would able get out those missions study all all the article does not have sufficient data say that the outcome worth the risk,539,0.0092764378478664,4
the landform mars quite interesting and there could many thoughts how came with already known knowledge and knowledge that soon come people like guess with the already known knowledge know far that aliens have not been found mars yet therefore they couldn have possibly made mark like earth mars planet just with different features our earth forms mountains and hills due erosion and our plate tectonics naturally formed the planet living organism created the rocky mountains with that able assumed that mars can form own hills and mountains well something else that credible that life form has been found mars yet who knows mars has erosion layers under surface that able move mars there life that could have possibly created such piece art earth itself makes beautiful art like the grand canyon and niagra falls naturally these landforms formed earth nobody knows exactly mars able that but with the replayability have today has not proven that any life form could have created the face mars these markings were made some kind living organism almost certainly would know about especialy with all the high technology have today would able see any kind life maybe explored underneath the surface mars then could get more information see mars could have created these aliens are living underneath great way assume how happened comparing mars earth but could also irrelevent earth unlike mars has atmosphere keeps heat but changes earth also has water and life this were cause the rocks hills and mountains then could said that the face mars was not created erosion water anything like that takes lot studding and even more knowledge figure out but aliens don seem logical quite yet,429,0.0093240093240093,3

there are both positive and negative aspects about driverless cars the one hand they seem like good idea because the car could drive for someone they too tired etc but the other hand they could bad idea because legal problems and the sameness the cars themselves personally think that they are bad idea because the lack safety legal issues and the potential increase distracted driving think that driverless cars are bad idea mainly because the lack safety paragraph five the article says that sensors have gotten much better the last ten years which signifies that they most likely get better within the next ten years also however there always that small risk that the sensors could stop working make mitake the second reason why think that driverless cars are bad idea because the legal issues paragraph nine raises lot questions about what would happen the case accident driverless car got into accident then who would fault the manufacturer the person the car even there were new laws the article states there would still have new laws cover liability the final reason why think that driverless cars are bad idea because the potential increase distracted driving paragraph the article states that even driverless cars were realistic people the car would have bored and need something however the people person the car busy with the entertainment they might not see what going the road which could cause accident overall think that driverless cars are not good idea they have huge lack safety more legal issues and potential increase distracted driving although there are also many benefits having driverless cars think that the disadvantages weight out the advantages this case these types cars would take way too long for people adjust and don think that the adjusting period worth putting peoples lives danger driverless cars may sound like cool idea but when there are too many disadvantages them not worth the risk,447,0.0067114093959731,4

although the idea driverless cars might sound life changing see very little aspects how this could positively affect our world therefore not support the idea driverless cars driverless cars would take away jobs they could possibly also take away milestones our lives seems like this idea came from pure laziness firstly driverless cars will take away huge milestone upcoming generation lives remember when you first learned ride bike now think about the time when you first sat behind car steering wheel this milestone that talking about learning how drive car future generations will have need complete this with the idea driverless cars the permit test and drivers test may not exist the future with driverless cars around secondly driverless will responsible for the disappearance road police officers today see these men and women monitoring the road and keeping everyone safe will not need them anymore because driverless cars matter what driverless cars would most likely obey all speed limits posted you may thinking well won safer environment driverless cars obey the speed limits yes you are correct but what glitch occured this technology generated car and decided not follow regular code this would huge issue the manufacture part lastly the idea driverless cars put into action frightens think how lazy would all become technology already immensely over taking our world and driverless cars are solving not one issue yes being chauffered around could relaxing once awhile but what happened earning the things you worked for driverless cars are the start humans being handed everything silver platter conclusion not support the idea driverless cars why not driverless cars will take away milestones they will take away jobs and they will make lazy what next need walk around anymore will have everything the push button who knows start voicing our opinions decide what happens with these ideas,441,0.0068027210884353,4

the tuesday after the first monday november can you guess what election day every four years nearly every person america will vote choose new president yes live democracy where can vote for who runs out country but really make the decision the electoral college phase where electors candidate running for president come together and decide for who the president vice president and include the counting the electoral votes from congress the person who runs for president has select group people known electors which are typically chosen that person political party this who really vote for and fair this should eradicated using the electoral college don directly vote for our own president vote for his her electors them who really choose who leads not what the electoral college states that when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate electors meaning aren actually voting for president just his her electors could literally anybody not holding public office this not direct way for vote for who makes the decisions around here electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong claims that over percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now sixty percent said that that incredible the electoral votes are just unequal the states that are bigger would obviously get more electoral votes than let say maryland california would have more votes than maryland because such bigger the house represenatives has its own unique way handling that and they going just fine don need another just isn reliable the numbers and percentages would all boggled this country based equality and liberty and there equality this the electoral college much too confusing sometimes voters could discombobulated about who they are voting for sometimes voters can control who the electors vote for this both confusing and frustrating for anyone who thinks they voted for someone great but the electors change that electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong says that under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president meaning that don choose for ourselves they some could say its anarchy that its not democratic which could true defense the electoral college states that but each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the party nominee however entirely possible that the winner the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote this means that even though you vote for person probably fifty fifty chance your person will win does also help release the stress worrying about run off election and avoids the problem where candidate receives majority votes that has been cast the electoral college not the best way vote our beautiful country can deceiving and confusing though may have one two advantages the list things that can wrong with are plenty unfair and could turn nasty should abolished make america more equal,719,0.0083449235048678,5

dear senator has come well many other attention that the presidential election something that could potentially have disasterous outcomes you and many litigations like yourself have been using system called the electoral college that people such richard nixon bob dole and jimmy carter have been suggesting demolish for years now personally find quite alarming that although this process has been with for all this time have found the flaws yet still continue take the risks this not simply about picking president anymore this about the freedom america all all the electoral college face value seems like good idea for choosing winner seems make sense that would choose electors who the president trusts that would elect him president but when you think about something feels rather off first all the general public places their ballots the appropriate box believing that they are voting for their ideal candidates reality however they are voting for their electors instead most people who vote are unaware this factor and the lack information pertaining unsettling not only that but the electors are not chosen the people does this not contradict the people for the people where exactly these people fit furthermore the electors can not always trusted with voting for their respective candidates this something referred the disaster factor while most who are picked the candidate themself are trustworthy electors are people who are not office therefore may not trusting electors are uncertain factor and some complex cases even two slates for electors can sent which could create hectic mess you are going vote for president who you wish win and your vote goes elector that won come through takes all the power away from the people and places right back into the state hands another thing consider when pondering the validity this process the potential tie with electoral voting this case the election would the power the house representatives and the representatives from each state would decide the winner have had many opportunities for tie during the elections one even being the difference ohio and hawaii the problem with this the loss power within the nation once again the people will longer have say the voting and the energy took them decide candidate and out vote will for virtually nothing the people will longer represented something like this were happen our country surely people from every state would outraged now you may thinking yourself why should worried sure unlikely get tie the electoral votes however something huge deciding the leader this country should not have even single flaw horrible and unexpected things happen everyday why couldn get tie well now the main problem with getting rid the electoral college the possibility run off elections defense this the electoral college the main reason that have run off elections the first place prevents people certain areas from voting because they feel they will have say the final result even people still voted for the fun was only because chance political preference with election popular vote the chances run off election would significantly lower people would realize the power they had deciding you finish reading this ask you consider all the points have made certain that choosing elect popular vote would have more benefits than sticking the old and flawed plan the electoral college endless proof points the conclusion that this theory correct the process picking electors elect the president redundant and confusing finally with all the things that could wrong using new system would one step forward making our nation even greater from proper name,836,0.0023923444976076,6

humans always want come with new ways make life simpler wether microwave that runs faster even more comfortable running shoes those all seem like pretty mundane things compared what manufactures are developing now try think world where cars use half they use for fuel today where nobody has buy car because they aren needed thats what manufacturers are trying they are trying develop cars that not need drivers cars that can drive themselves since the people have been trying develop cars that not require driver personally not agree with the idea driverless car the idea good one but been development since the and they still haven made fully functional driverless car there are people who say the reason why because don have the exact technology actually create car the driverless yes that true but when will they have the technology five years from now twenty years from now don know and whose say will ever get that technology google anounced that had cars that could drive their own but only special circumstances the cars they have developed the driver still has stay alert for when the car gets into roadwork has drive around accident that could pose danger because what the driver falls asleep isn paying attention the road that could pose threat both the driver and others well being also some manufacturers have been developing smart road system with dual polarity magnets the cars would read the polarities and would stay the road the issue with that create smart road system would take much time and effort put together which make very impractical instead manufacturers turned smarter cars instead they destined have sensors that would mimic the actions human like monitoring the road video cameras mounted near the rearview mirror and inertial motion sensor all sounds very grand laborite and very expensive bmw announced the development traffic jam assist the car would able handle driving functions speed twenty five miles per hour however special touch sensors make sure the driver always have their hands the wheel see multiple issue with the idea traffic jam assist first off the car can only take control functions speeds twenty five miles per hour also the driver has take control they are over twenty five miles per hour fact none the cars that have been developed actually are truly driverless they can steer accelerate and brake but the driver still has take control sometimes what would happen the driver got distracted fell asleep the wheel disaster would follow there are many perks about driver less cars less fuel being one them but there are also many issues see with the cars developed having have driver them ready take over necesssary some states not allowing driverless car test not having the exact technology needed make these cars safe possible and not mention human error that can always occur driving believe that maybe the future when technology has advance more then maybe driverless cras wouldn obsolete but right now the era driverless cars are not needed mainly because still have driving issue that need solved like people getting distracted phones reckless drivers and cars that aren built good begin with the future they might have purpose but until they can develop car that completely safe and has the technology needed create simply not need driverless cras,755,0.0132450331125827,5

imagine the world the future completely full and covered with cars roads are going start taking every area earth people continue driving everywhere and buying cars think people should limit car usage because environmental friendly they get more exercise and people will happier cars can handy from time time but think they should only used occasionally imagine there was car for everyone the planet car usage should decrease first all the earth beautiful and the people need take better care for example just one day without the use cars city allowed them construct bike paths new sidewalks and reduced traffic jams fuel from cars will pollute the air and cause smog everyone continues use cars much they more there will way clean all the air when paris banned cars for while smog was cleared and reduced lot limiting car use will not save the earth completely but will help very much secondly people started using cars less they could get outside more and get more exercise biking will help people get fresh air and decrease pollution because cars won used much people should start finding jobs doing activities that are close enough walk bike cars are for situations which you really have other way there long distances that all think they should used for everyone would much more fit and healthy weren for being lazy and having take car there lastly not using cars could increase people happiness some people suggest that having car makes them tense everyone would become much closer together and explore more the world without cars could all outdoors around each other more for example you could take the bus work instead your car and meet new friend you never know what could happen when you try something new good change things once while like not taking your car every now and then and finding another way there conclusion the positives definately outnumber the negatives limiting car use the main three reasons opinion that environmental friendly you get more exercise and you most likely much happier think about all the good outcomes that could come out not driving your car and try sometime,494,0.0060728744939271,4
say change changing election popular vote for the president the united states can way better idea than keeping the electoral college the electoral college system the voters dont vote for the president they vote for slate electors those slate electors who turn elect the president source they talk about why the best laid defenses the system are wrong own opinion think that changing election popular vote for the president the united states electoral college gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency over percent votes would prefer direct election the kind have now source they talk about what the electoral college how works the electoral college process not place process consists the selection the electors meeting the electors where they vote for president vice president the counting the votes congress the electoral college consists electors majority votes required elect the president the amendment the constitution the district columbia allocated electors treated like state for purposes the electoral college the word state also refers the district columbia every candidate running for president your state has his her own group electors presidential election held every years the tuesday after the first monday november when you vote for president you help choose your state electors because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate electors most states have winner take all system that awards all electors the winning presidential candidate source they talk about why the best laid defenses the system are wrong gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency over percent voters would prefer direct election the kind have now under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president for instance you lived texas wanted vote for john kerry you would voting for slate democratic electors pledged kerry the electors can anyone not holding public office depends the state pick the electors first place sometimes voters get confused about the electors vote for the wrong candidate back segregationists the louisiana legislature nearly suceeded replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john kennedy,506,0.0059288537549407,2
there have been many discussions whether not having electoral college the system decide the president alright many people say this system corrupted and that must thrown out think new better government system while many other people disagree and state that yes this system works perfectly well and that should keep this way for many years course most the population the country simply believe this system best and should keep this may because certainty the outcome and because the system made out well course there also downside this such when person goes vote their not necessarily voting for whom they believe voting for begin with having the electoral college great because the fact that there certainty the outcome said source richard posner there absolute certainty the person you voting for going win lose the reason that the winning candidate share the electoral college invariably exceeds his share the popular vote for example the election obama received percent the electoral vote compared only percent the popular votes cast for him and romney using this example explains that the electoral college win you must need the majority votes furthermore the system self made out really well said source the electoral college process consists the selection the electors which consists and only takes electoral votes elect president during this meeting they vote for who they want president and vice president also your state entitled allotment electors equals the number members its congressional delegation way you could say that the electoral college like game and many people just want gone because they aren good just don understand course there always downside everything this flaw that when you voting you not voting for who you believe you are voting for said source when you vote for your president the vote doesn the president but for the slate electors who turn elect the president this may not sound bad but with something such this there could easily some corruption that and could change the outcome the election but even with this said unlikeable chance when you vote the elector you voted for most likely going elector which will vote for your president worries conclusion letting the electoral college stay good idea well thought out system and the certainty which president will elected completely accurate which doesnt make big guessing game don pay attention those conspiracies the electoral college that have great system,590,0.0101694915254237,4

imagine being stuck traffic again for the fifth time this week you glance the time and you see that you running late for work again cars can cause alot problems like for example people get into many car crashes that kill many innocent children bystanders the traffic jams always take hours clear and the exhaust the tail pipe polluting the air there are many advantages limiting car usage the advantages are there will more people bikes and walking place place less traffic and less pollution the air although cars may come handy they can real pain have like for instance paying car insurance every month paying for gas and paying for your car anything breakers and needs new part the car usage was limited there will more people bikes and walking this good for the residents because they are spending less money and they are getting excercise from this vauban germany the residents there have given their cars vauban families not own cars rosenthal there only transportation there tram that runs though freiburg rosenthal this helps residents there get place place kaiser also with the car limitations there will whole lot less traffic the roads for example paris france they made even numbered license plates residents leave their cars home then the next day odd numbered license plate residents duffer even though they tried ban the cars there were drivers fined due driving their cars duffer also when this rule was put into place there was less traffic the capital france the traffic went down duffer most importantly there will less pollution the air residents cars dont really know how much pollution put into the air when they drive the exhaust from the tail pipe car causing huge defect this earth greenhouse effect france the pollution was bad there was smog the air from all the cars duffer the smog france was bad the world most polluted cities the world beijing china duffer also bogota colombia there was really bad smog but after the car limitation there was huge decrease the smog selsky conclusion there are many advantages car limitation the advantages are there will more people bikes and walking place place less traffic and less pollution the air with less cars this will help our earth big time because the greenhouse effect will stop getting car exhaust pumped through there also may fine alternate ways replace gas and oil make this world healthier,560,0.0071428571428571,4

disagree little bit that there gon na driverless cars future know that there will more electric cars preserve more gas there are advantages with driverless cars there will probably less accidents have less careless drivers out the streets have sensors where someone backs something close the car will automatically hit the brakes driverless cars will probably have better and engine and suspension system but just dont think that driverless cars are gon na the trick because what the car breaks down out nowhere and you cant start back what you have drive manually and the steering wheel doesn work what are you going would prefer more electric cars than driverless cars because you wouldn have worries about gas money anything like that but would probably more towards electric cars save gas because driverless cars you would still need gas money,189,0.0052910052910052,2

the way that detective can identify lying truthfulness impressive people while decoding emotions definitely little more complicated even may seem like its easy tell how someone feeling and you can see your friend simply upset excited like the article said explaining them and reading more complicated emotions most likely isnt easy technology read our emotions definitely sign that software getting more advanced but not necessarily more helpful this software course can benefited from ways entertainment and efficiency technology but classrooms think that different debate and thoughts this classrooms are that pretty much the opposite helpful this article the example they use show how could efficient schools classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored and then goes say how the software could change the lesson for them give some help what would average student saying this software isnt yet classrooms the same situation raise their hand ask for help from teacher and get personal help just the same way the technology would solve the problem fair though not all students have available teacher some work home what could those students contact someone else like teacher for example online school figure out and eventually understand the problem all the same with this technology course the idea that the student doesnt have put any effort asking for help and could identify the eventual solution just showing emotion worded differently this entire example how classroom computers are beneficial could become statement flaws this idea firstly the software could most likely easily tricked and for the evidence students easily being able get help manipulate the lesson emotions the student could also manipulate the lesson purposefully using the softwares features easily get ahead problems simply not put much effort into understanding for the point ease becuse the software with students who are simply confused good point but what about the lessons that communicating teaches them the future their life isnt going only technology based and what happens when people rely too much the ease simply getting their emotions read and start not easily communicate with actual people not everyone can see what troubles you having just looking what would someone think when they are trying convey certain feeling and one notices because its definitely not that easy for normal people understand how someone feeling and thats what being around others and asking for help communicating their feelings prepares them for they would learn talk others and problem solve not only social situations but also educational ones this article the way that its written shows many possibilities for this technology but when comes the software replacing communication even just simply school isnt necessarily beneficial students would rely too much the technology view student and even seems helpful first read the technology could modify simple values like sharing feelings communicating and even interacting within future generations not necessarily saying that would get that far into the idea technology taking over values but replacing basic things like teachers and showing strong emotions could definitely reverse the deficiency human communication using words from their article your home cant handle the complex algorithms used decode mona lisa smile and words neither can people learn show how you feel strongly without expecting someone tell you the percents,743,0.0107671601615074,5

the face mars have you ever seen something crazy something maybe face something that you seen before have you thought about how that face something else has gotten there well for start defiantly wasn aliens just like the face mars people belive that the face was created aliens but that isn true the face mars just and only natural landform that some how was created earth for first reason why the face mars just natural landform because nasa later reveled that the face was not made aliens but shadows few days after that image was found nasa needed take look and figure out what made this incredible and scientific picture unique and why and how was formed later they have came with good explanation about this unique image nasa said this huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose and mouth scientifically the face was made from natural cause makes very different natural landform now for second reason why this was not made aliens but just natural landform that there scientific research showing that aliens exist and created this face now know that some people say that they have seen aliens but scientists dont think that one hundred percent true because they don have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real many people belive them but how know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge but now after nasa did some research they found out that even though don have information about them aliens did not create that face was only natural landform for third and final reason why the face was not created aliens and only natural landform because the last paragraph paragraph twelve they talk about how the the picture actually shows that the martian equivalent butte mesa since the landform shows butte mesa that means that the image was major landform that came from the american west garvin says reminds most middle butte the snake river plain idaho also said that lava dome that takes the form isolated mesa about the same height the face mars this not only natural landform but major natural landform agree little bit about aliens creating the face somewhere space there are aliens that created something else not one day maybe can find something out space that has something with aliens but today just isn the day that but overall would have agree that aliens did not create this but this only natural landform created something other than aliens you can see this creative landform was most defiantly not created from aliens but just nice natural landform scientists now figured out that this face mars from shadows and not from aliens this landform actually butte mesa which very interesting have found out many people did belive that the face mars was created aliens but scientists haven found out there are aliens not shouldn jump into conclusion but overall this face was definately landform and not created aliens,699,0.0114449213161659,5
agree with the idea that the facial action coding system should used students and infact anyone general wanted read emotion expression can help out alot teen someone has something bottled deep inside them its not good keep emotions bottled for long time will eventually get you but with the help this machine you use someone and there not okay you can genuinely help them you can get some help for them yourself for example something happening home and they become all sad and depressed and wont tell anyone why theyre feeling what they are feeling and one has clue you can use the machine help figure out and get them the help that they properly need wether its they need someone talk about troubles they actually need see doctor check and see they have something wrong with them one downside this machine that what they get the emotions wrong out all the emotions the machine bound get one wrong because many people feel like many different things and there chance get the feelings wrong the other hand dont know how many types emotions there are listed within the machine there could almost all emotions plugged into this machine very innovative and amazing idea help students anyone general can help with gerty people help they way they needed get help umstead keeping all their emotions all bottled its not good for anyone,310,0.0096774193548387,3

every four years the united states turned into political battleground the campaign for presidency the electoral college the voting method used since the nation began being highly questioned its efficiency now the efficiency years ago however the system has survived because works despite its flaws the electoral college does good job simplifying the presidential election and eliminating disputes potential crisis produces clear winner makes sure that the president popular all areas the country and puts the weight the campaign the swing states most presidenta races the president wins only small margin rarely there landslide victory complete vote for president this small majority can lead many disputes over the credibility counting the votes the individual states this why the electoral college helps the voting process the electoral college helps the voting process because produces more clear winner for example line claims that election for example obama recieved percent the electoral vote sompare only percent the popular votes cast for him and romney this shows that while the poplar vote can extremely tight the winner gaining sometimes less than percent the poplar votes the electoral college helps the system giving the winner landslide advantage and therefore clearing any claims over the credibility the popular votes which the loser can produce also the electoral college helps prevent the situation president winning the majority the votes the introduction third parties can sometimes mean that party gains more than half the votes however the electoral college helps deal with that situation and nixon and clinton both had less than the majority but won because they had the electoral college their favor this why the electoral college still works today there are some areas the nation that are very highly populated the southern and western regions the nation are becoming more and more populated and the northern regions are diminishing size popular vote president who wins the southern regions alone would have good chance winning the nation however that system does not work under the electoral college vote the electoral college good system for voting the president because requires president popular across the nation under the electoral college president can not suffice winning the votes couple states they must get points from states across the nation and then will add victory this good because president with only regional majority will mainly focus the region which based the other regions will disregarded and not paid much attention the electoral college prevents this outcome this another reason why the electoral college good method picking the presidency most states will have tendency almost always vote for particular party the real difference electoral votes lies mostly the states who will vote either way swing states the electoral college good thing because puts the emphasis the states who will vote either way ensuring the credibility the candidate these swing states know that they are the ones who decide the election therefore the voters these states who pay more attention the campaign who research the candidates more and who listen what the candidates have say this bonus for the electoral college because means that the candidate who will elected the candidate who will best for the country not necessarily the most popular because this the electoral college should remain the system voting the presidency there are arguments that the electoral college should abolished that the system sending electors congress vote for them does not work because they can guarantee that the electors will vote for who they are supposed however the chances that happening today and the elector getting away with are very slim today the people and the government know exactly how much votes each state gave each candidate and they know exactly how much electoral votes candidate should get even you manage add vote your candidate very likely that someone will the math and figure out that something not right with the votes like every system the electoral college has its flaws however the system the best can put place elect new president the system still used after years because easily simplifies the disputes that can easily occur over the tight popular vote margins the next time you vote for the president you know that you are voting the most efficient democratic system date,948,0.0042194092827004,6

the article driverless cars are coming the author states how our technology increasing much today that soon will see cars that drive themselves the author states some negative sides the story and some positive but think that driverless cars will help our country many different ways and support according the author says will even able make new cars because there are laws that not allow some states test them according the article result most states illegal even test computer driven cars think car manufacturers can test their cars factory some states that legal and once they prove that safe believe that some states will uplift the laws that they have self driving cars also many people ask the technology fails and someone injured who faulted driver the manufacturer this one the main concerns people today but would believe would the manufacturers fault since they were the ones who made the car and designed all the parts humans should have worry about liability for themselves because the car manufacturers should cover all the expenses that happened the accident since they were the ones who designed the cars another benefit self driving cars that they also would reduce half the fuel that humans use today accoring the text states the cars foresees would use half the fuel todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus believes such cars would fundamentally change the world not using half the amount fuel today super beneficial for the environment since are not polluting nearly much many people would support this because would help save the environment and also would not have spend nearly much money gas normally another benito how all the cars would safe according bmw safety big concern clearly bmw would not release the car was not safe but our country all switches self driving cars then this will reduce the crashes and accidents ton which would saving many lives many automakers are working developing new safety gadgets for cars and also couple the automakers have already developed self driving car tesla for example tesla has projected release for car capable driving autopilot percent the time tesla has projected that they will release car that the time autopilot that this year and when they release all the other automakers are going try and design better self driving car than the tesla which could make the other manufacturers come out with new self driving car soon also some other automakers have said mercedes benz audi and nissan plan have cars that can drive themselves this crazy the time least three more auto makers predict that they will have self driving cars also the should expect self drivin cars that will the road conclusion there are many positives benefits that will come out this self driving car though there are some set backs that some states automakers will have over come the end outcome will help drivers safety and will help the environment the overall outcome that why should have self driving automobiles,713,0.0126227208976157,4

there are still some disputes about the true identity and origin the face mars most likely just natural landform but some people disagree some people believe that was created aliens however since there legit proof aliens even being real how could you prove that they did this nasa also has high resolution photographs that make pretty clear that just natural landform may have taken several tries collect all the needed data back this but the scientists did now know briefly mentioned before there proof alien life actually existing then why are people convinced that was aliens yes may have strange shape but that doesn mean anything there are strange shaped things here earth but people don accuse being alien now understand that this space and different planet but still there are way more logical explanations normal for there landforms planets that simply the deal here the scientists also collected high resolution photos the face when the best photo was taken was made clear that this was just landform similar some the american west was just formation that looked suspicious from far away you looked the zoomed picture just looks like jumble rocks people just need think realistically there however couple small reasons why people see possibility this being done aliens one the pictures was taken from behind small wispy cloud this gave some people enough reason believe that there could alien markings hidden the haze another reason people have for believing this extraterrestrial work that there have been some unexplainable sightings and findings that may point alien life existing there actual facts proof but enough has happened without logical explanations convince certain people this theory respectfully refute these points the idea alien markings being hidden stretch there was even clear picture taken more recently that showed alien markings proved that was just landform there really not that much more response the few unexplainable things that may point alien life have way tell what really out there there something then doing pretty good job staying hidden undiscovered because have cold hard proof anything for some things there are just logical answers there always going something don know probably the most reasonable just stick the facts already have and learn accept the most likely stories yes okay believe hope that there something out there but people should also realize that they need think reasonably certain matters especially when there proof like this case this very strong argument there are many ways that person could keep going and explaining each detail its full extent but think all the most important information has already been mentioned people should accept the facts there always going someone who disagrees but every argument like that there way more proof pointing the conclusion that the face just landform you might still think something different but think made clear why have much reason believe what believe,704,0.0,5

are driverless cars safe new invention cars have been created which allows you drive without necessarily driving many ways this smart and creative way thinking though does have some negative sides though some cases would argue for the developement these cars many cases driverless cars are more useful and environment friendly would use half the fuel used today most cars and offers more flexibility than bus even though they are considered driverless they still require the same amount attention you would you were actually driving some these cars have been tested and can drive more than half million miles without crash which higher than average vehicle which can travel less and more likely crash these inventions the something any normal vehicle would they can steer accelerate and brake themselves this means that could give driver break relax while stil focusing the road the individual gives all priorities the car itself but when the driverless car senses that there something ahead near that can not itself will alert the driver the car has things such vibrating seats and flashing lights the windshield alert the driver not only does the driverless car drive itself with the help some human skills but also helps with safety issues the driverless car has invention sensors that are the far which are said allow far better response and control than human driver could manage alone the built software can cause the car apply brakes and reduce power from the engine when detects out control skids rollovers also can allow drivers thinks such text and drive without having the safety issue wrecking because the driverless car driving for them and can alert the individual when she needs take over although the driverless cars have both positive and negative aspects about there are far more positive things say allows drivers safer than any human could possibly driver and also also the driver have break while still being able focus the road while the only negative concern you wreak therefore driverless cars have proven that they are good and safe invention,445,0.0112359550561797,4

driverless cars are coming the near future there debate for whether not should allow them the public roads people say that driverless cars are perfectly safe and that can save the amount gas used currently lot think that should allow driverless cars because they can reduce the amount driving related accidents car companies are already planning release them public consumers specific times and can reduce the amount gas used driverless cars can reduce the amount car accidents and reckless drivers the driverless cars use sensors makes safe for the drivers sensors are already being used cars for example the toyota prius uses sensors the left rear wheel rotating sensor the roof video camera mounted near the rearview mirror and more sensors the sensors are very advanced they can detect and respond danger faster than human the sensors can tell the car apply brakes with better response time and control than human could possibly sensors are only getting more advanced can only get safer the future and perfectly safe use them driverless cars some people may say that possible that sensor fails work technology can get messed but the chance rare and would cause far less car accidents than human had full control over the wheel the smart cars still allow control from the human and the car alerts the human they and the car are danger something were happen the human could take control and try stop the car still allows people steer accelerate and brake themselves the google car announces when the driver should prepared take over made driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle danger google has been testing driverless cars since some companies are also considering using cameras watch the drivers make sure that they are alert and paying attention case something happens where the human would need take control there has been over half million miles them and crashes far perfectly safe the consumer use the driverless cars can also used reduce the amount gas used today lot google cofounder sergey brin said that the cars foresees would use half the fuel today taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus people spend lot money gas and expensive can reduce that amount half then people can use that money they saving more important things and can possibly improve our economy companies are already planning for the future car companies are making driverless cars and have set dates when they will available consumers tesla has projected release for car capable driving autopilot percent the time mercedes benz audi and nissan plan for the release driverless cars driverless cars are the future and companies have already planned for them they are perfectly safe and they can reduce the amount spending money gas driverless cars can way more than they can bad and the bad worse than what going now should get ready for driverless cars the future,649,0.0015408320493066,4

dear state senator propose that change the election popular vote for the president the united states rather than having the electoral college say this because the electoral college unfair voters many ways more than one start off saying that electoral college unfair voters strongly agree about this because under the electoral college system voters not vote for the president they vote for slate electors who then elect the president this system unfair because you don always know who your electors are and you can always control who the electors vote for you can don know who they are voting for then how can trust them with the fate our country although people don always make the right decisions least with popular vote would all know that our votes wouldn put someone elses hands continue agrement the electoral college also unfair this way say there was tie electoral votes the election would given the house representatives then the state delegations would vote for the president and the senate would chose the vice president when this would happen you would then not know who they were going vote for and what your government fate would again had election popular vote this wouldn happen lastly the electoral college unfair voters the winner take all system since there winner take all system each state candidates don spend time states they know they have chance winning example this back during the campaign seventeen states didn get see the candidates all some the largest media markets didn even see single campaign this completely unfair and ridiculous all potential voters the end think that the electoral college unfair outdated and ridiculous with all the valid points and arguments have made they make pretty good reason abolish the electoral college,404,0.0024752475247524,4

many have claimed that the human face found mars alien artifact but how certain are they according nasa the face mars just rock formation that resembles the face human but others may disagree believe that the face found mars just natural landform further investigate this topic will begin analyzing how the face was formed and how compares landforms earth where was located and what causes others believe that alien artifact some might believe that the called alien artifact was leaftoed behind aliens but nasa unveiled image the face and this what they came with according the caption the image noted huge rock formation which resembles human head formed shadows giving the illusion eyes nose annd mouth this image was even compared natural landforms found earth according the passage the picture portrays the martian equivalent butte mesa landforms common around the american west the passage also claims that the image reminds him the middle butte the snake river plain idaho and that the face mars about same height isolated mesa which landform the face mars was located degress north martian latitude during the winter april this time the year was also considered the cloudiest time year the red planet the fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time year mars can affect the turn out this theory few scientists believed that the face was alien artifact and photographing the cydonia became one the biggest priorities for nasa soon the viking mission was ended the chief scientist nasa mars exploration program stated that they photographed the face soon they could get good shot believe they did this clarify their foundlings stated before many people including scientists believe that the face mars alien artifact and here are their reasons why the photo the face mars was being taken was claimed that the camera board mgs had peer through the wispy clouds see the face and according skeptics alien markings were hidden haze this did not stop mission controllers and they prepared look again garvin states that not easy target cydonia and that its hardwork conspiracy theorists believe that the face bona fide evidence life mars evidence that nasa would rather hide now this may all sound convincing but was also added that you can discern things digital image times bigger than the pixel size causing false illusions conclusion after analyzing the data and research given believe that the face mars just natural landform others may disagree but all about your interpretation the topic and hopefully the evidence used support claims did just that,608,0.0115131578947368,4
the picture shows face but how long ago was that picture taken was when the first picture was taken they had camera with pixels thats not good the picture was taken like there were objects this picture like airplanes the ground egyptian style pyramids even small shacks you could see what they were was taken meters away the picture was taken again and the camera was getting better and better the picture looks more clear then the epicure that was taken over time the picture got more clear the picture was taken again and was taken wide stripes away this time didnt even look like face the middle butte looks like snake from the air but doesnt make snake you saying aliens made that too the way the water moved made like that facts show that one point looked like face but wasnt done alien the way the picture was taken the reason why you could use the moon example everyone use think there was man the moon just the way looks but clearly there isnt man the moon the way the picture taken can make shadow and can make you see things that arent really there,256,0.01171875,3

dear senator there have been multiple arguments wether not the electoral college should used for electing the president electing president the electoral college better idea than electing president through popular vote representatives know what right for their country while most american citizens would not make the right decisions and sometimes not even make any decisions all first off citizens themselves elect their own state representatives for the house representatives they vote for them for many reasons the representatives are well educated the people vote for the representatives and return they expect and trust the representatives make the right decisions for them electing new president pretty big deal and should taken care the hands the trusted representatives according richard posner article five reasons keep our despised method choosing the resident that trust rarely betrayed stated reason this article the most thoughtful voters should the ones decide the election the representatives are the most thoughtful voters this what the representatives their job they dedicate most their life representing the people who elected them and making decisions their behalf they should the ones doing the decision making now this were not this case and popular vote was the priority source votes electing president then the voting results would completely biased there would chance that majority the votes put into the ballot were decided without true thought people could easily vote something important just randomly electing just like closing your eyes and choosing marble out marble jar they could also vote for the canidate who their best friend voted for and not even think about their own opinion why they even decided choose that person the first place another thing that affects the voting charts the lack participation americans not vote every american citizen has the right vote their civil duty vote during election and yet them still choose not what better country run people making uneducated decisions major things having the thoughtful people the ones who decide the course this country unless america increases the quality education and spreads the word the amount importance that vote important tasks such electing president should kept the hands the educated representatives the electoral college thank you for your time sincerely american citizen,507,0.0,4

the face mars most definitely something just not what conspiracies say isn some ancient alien artifact photos taken satelites and other evidence shows that merely just naturally formed mesa much like the ones see here our own planet may interesting imagine that the remnants ancient civilization gone for thousands years but that reality will unfortunately end staying our heads the first images the ghostly face taken nineteen seventy six were quite blurry this probably one reason that has been mistaken evidence life mars another possible reason that looked human like was because the shadows the face was casting the martian surface the shadows blended together create even more obscured image all these things caused people mistake the face mars for something more than really the second time nasa took photos the mysterious figure the camera took them ten times sharper than the previous ones this provided even clearer evidence that the face was actually just part the rust colored martian landscape unfortunately the pictures were take during cloudy time year for mars which turn added slight layer haziness the image this cause theorists says that the view the markings made the aliens was concealed the heavy amount clouds can understand why skeptics would think this pretty unreasonable opinion some people even believe that nasa hiding the true reality the photographs from the rest the world question them why would nasa that nasa really did find evidence life mars there would reason hide fact would good for nasa would draw more attention the organization and maybe more people would become interested their findings point that nasa would have nothing hide the final images didn have anything them for conspiracy theorists use against nasa claims finally putting the myths about the face mars rest the images had extremely high clarity better than any the pictures taken before these final photos proved that the face wasn anything made alien lifeforms but just regular mesa the proof may have let some people down but has satisfied lot people too,469,0.0021321961620469,4

dear state senator the electoral college has been here since the founders this country put our constitution please both sides this electoral college has made lot history our great nation and appreciate what has done for huge part our election process but time move from their have been many instances where presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because didn have enough electoral votes happened when gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes but that was the first time since source this may have not happened more than twice but this could easily happen again and cause catastrophe this why disapprove the electoral college this process also unfair voters because when they vote for president they are really voting for electors the electors can any citizen the voters don know who the electors are voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them disadvantage and inconvenience for the voters under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors who turn elect the president source there has been several organizations and people who have tried get the electoral college deleted from election processes including richard nixon jimmy carter bob dole the chamber commerce and the afl cio source these are multiple people with proven track records and are some many who are ready for change the electoral college has brought good and bad our country but there are times when things should left the past using the popular vote the one and only way electing presidents needed this country the choice presidents should soley the american people there should electoral college that can totally change the outcome election because one candidate doesnt have enough electoral votes eyes appears the electoral college has slightly much impact the outcome the election imagine running for president and you when the hearts the voters with popular votes but happen lost the election because you didn have enough electoral votes how would you feel about the electoral college after that experience this why there need for change the electoral college save candidates from losing election that they should have one but didn becuase they didn have enough electoral votes,494,0.0060728744939271,4

believe that should not include the electoral college our decision who should our next president putting the responsibility the electoral college means that voters are putting lots trust into electors making the right decision and that always doesnt turn out the way people want them nto turn out lets details why not favor keeping the electoral college this position the electoral college consists electors who role vote for the president favor there representative that not fair for two main reasons one being that people america should all able vote under their own opinion according freedom speech which was explain one the amendments dont need group special people vote for independent nation which also means that are independent ourselves the second one being that cant control who the voters are which means that can not trust that the voters are making the right decision pick our president because trust the president decisions and actions like says bradford plumer article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong who are the electors they can anyone not holding public office who picks the electors the first place depends the state electoral college depends systems and not the nation people which not fair voting for our president the united states people may say that there are though benefits having electoral college stating that the representatives who are running for president are choosing trusted people who knows that they will make the right decision and also that there was ever dispute over the electoral college wouldn big major one but the other hand was hand off the regular citizens then would major problem bigger than the dispute the electoral college richard posner martialled defense the electoral college five reasons keep our despised method choosing the president says the electoral college avoids the problem elections which candidate recieve majority the votes cast believe this fair statement because people would think that the majority the vote will automatically given that representative president the united states but thats not tru according the electoral college the have electors and there electors can just flip that decision upside down and would the opposite representative who would get the vote but then again the electors the electoral college can the opposite your favor the end the day comes down what you believe the right decision and the right decision for remove the electoral college even has mean war for the sake our country conclusion not favor keeping the electoral college senator for all these debates againt the electoral college believe strongly true what you think senator the decision rest your hands,605,0.0148760330578512,3

the presidental elections are huge deal the united states and everywhere else all sit anticipation see who our next leader hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people eventually making great place live not many people are well informed about this system have here and some are but could you imagine more people find out that they aren actually voting for the president but instead your are voting for the people that are voting for the president does that make any sense you very well know there are two sides every story senter many people agree with the electoral collage and many people don however personal belief that you should not support the electoral collage believe that this system unfair doesn give americans full control over elections and who running the country well the fact that many people voted for the electoral collage may make the wrong decisions which could jeopardize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system begin with the first reason don think you should support the electoral collage because the system unfair and doesn give americans full control over elections and their results during election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the president they play presidential for campaigns and the candidates give speeches around the country but your not really voting for the presidents then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads source two says you lived texas for instance and wanted vote for john kerry you vote for slate thirty four electoral votes who are the electors amd source says the founding fathers established the constitution compromise but honest really compromise you not involved people want involved this type stuff believe not matters them and because you are not really told people could for years thinking that their voting for the actual president but instead they are voting for politicans and hoping that they make the right decisions are really going leave the fait our country hope and people that don really know what their voting for this not fair and doesn live american values another reason that you shouldn support the electoral collage because many the politicans that people vote for make the wrong decisions and could jeopardize the future our country everyone makes mistakes but presidental elections you can vey important that things are monitored closely after all you are voting for person who going run and represent your country but many politicians feel that since they have power that they can whatever they want even far rigging election votes they can win source two states that those electors could always defy the will the people other words they may not listen what the people want and instead selfish and listen what they want now course know this isn right electors have occasionally refused vote for their party candidate and cast deciding vote for whomever they please this isn fair the people because doing that you are saying they don have say and people have lot trouble trusting politicians would you blame them not every day that you come across person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead themselves the final reason that you shouldn approve support the electoral system because the winners take all system this system candidates really don bother going speaking visiting the state their running this basically means that the people who vote for them are making blind vote without really knowing the person before voting for anyone any situation student council goverment and ect you need know that person you need make sure that they share the same values that you you need make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic people have enough trouble trusting politicans why make worse during the campaign seventeen states didnt see the candidates all this statement also includes political ads they saw none all and you expect them vote for the president the united states without prior knowledge how that even allowed that why call blind vote however even the midst all that wrong with electoral system people have found right for instance source says that but each party selects slate electors trusted vote for the party nominee and that trust rarely betrayed although this statement has some truth also has some false the problem that have with that statement that there are facts back sure you believe that our trust rarely betrayed but actually you don know politicans are very secretive and protected all cost you have ideas what going their office unless they make public announcement and sometimes that even lie don know our politicans really well personal basis sure you might think you because they shows tell you about their life but how much that truth and how much lie sometimes politicans lie protect the people from pain ect but you shouldn being doing that the middle one the most important elections the country ever has and mess some how the only way fix either impeaching the president waiting another four years hopefully make sure things right and get good president are you willing take that chance reiterate the bottom line that these electoral collages are important the people select our office are important however let our people become involved actual presidental elections are leaving the future our country hope and people who make the wrong decisions well the winner takes all system that really what want for our country people need involved thats why its called the united states american are suppose united sure our government could little corrupt times but maybe letting people become more involved may actually looking forward brighter and better america which what all want,1305,0.0076628352490421,6

driverless cars are the future there are many reasons why driverless cars will normality for the future few examples are that they will take less fuel and that they will more efficient for someone who always pressed for time with technology advancing more and more each day soon many people will own their own driverless car driverless cars will significantly more beneficial than manual cars driverless cars will take lot less fuel with fuel prices fluctuating they buying fuel each week can very inconvenient there are already some solutions this problem but the driverless car just another will take lot less fuel you can quit wasting money and time say you wake late for important meeting and not have enough time eat breakfast you have driverless car will lot easier for you eat the car without having worry about driving all the same time this car will save time for everyone and will make lot safer things like change the radio station check your phone while your driving driverless car will save you time and will allow put focus thing other than the road therefore being safer you might say that driverless car still illegal most states this because still has not been perfected the developers are still working ensure that driverless car safe enough the road all times all situations when states see that the car just safe not safer than manual car the laws will most likely change accomodate driverless car not there will many studies evaluate the saftey the car and statistics will show that there are less collisions the driverless car the states that still haven passed the law will most likely pass this point driverless cars are much safer fuel efficient and time efficient when they are released the public they will the next big thing they will the better option for everyone driverless cars will here soon and the world will much better place,430,0.0162790697674418,4
driverless cars the way the future more like stay the dream world think the idea driverless car ridiculous this point time safety issues misuse abuse and new ways the road all for the fact people don want drive themselves will safer don think have several reasons why think driverless cars are pointless now would cool just take nap and let the car control itself and take you your destination yes but that case you would have have car that actually able drive itself the cars are said win people over and when they are proven safe the key word there when sometime the future driverless cars may become big thing but right now they are not ready put the road don even think idea worth proposing the world driving assisting car designed drive itself going miles per hour slower where are you going that you are only going miles per hour can very far funny thing you are supposed alert just case obstacle such traffic jam accident occurs how driverless there has driver why not just drive the car yourself that like having self filling water bottle but you have turn the sink fill also the cars would probably used for people sleep just think they can relax while letting the car drive that going lead accidents and wih car thats supposed running itself whose blame accident and how can you prove who was fault here werre new laws would have come prove whose fault there would have camera the car recording insure the driver was alert and wasn manufacturing issue then isn that invading one privacy laws would have change and there would many expections due liability and how prove who fault just not think driverless cars are necesary especially when they don own their name now people could understand the car assisting and not driving then dont feel there would issue considering you have driving the called driverless car don have the laws figured out for liability accident figured out and since you have driving the car feel like its useless name get more attention,519,0.0077071290944123,4
driverless cars are swiftly becoming viable possibility for the near future they are capable outperforming many human drivers well being able return control the driver the case more complex situation that requires more thought than the car can handle this duality the main factor that makes self driving cars appear good plan for the future transportation the car manageable and not overriding the human input and yet still maintains feeling helpfulness and convenience when comes transport automation control over the process and the ability halt override chief concern system that controls itself and denies all outside input can not sustain itself for long that why quote the passage google cars are not truly driverless they still alert the driver take over when pulling and out driveways dealing with complicated traffic issues short the car not perfect and therefore has fall back the driver help some situations this prevents crashes due the car incapability surpass unique situation the road well promoting driver awareness even when the car operating itself doing this the self driving car model itself promotes safety and good road etiquette while the car may not able everything human driver can has proven much better the tasks can than average driver the cars provide far better response and control than human driver could manage alone this can coupled with the fact that these vehicles are being constantly upgraded order allow for more and more automated driving tasks perhaps the future there will come car that capable doing every driver task there leaving the driver sit back and relax conclusion while the industry has yet truly take off self driving cars are definite viability for the future human transport they provide comfort the fact that you are control and they also perform better than most human drivers would average overall they promote higher level alertness and safety than the average modern vehicle these facts together provide strong argument favor the autonomous self driving cars tomorrow,449,0.0044543429844097,4
dear senator believe that america should keep the electoral college elect the president the united states believe this because the electoral college makes guaranteed outcome gives proper representation big states and the president has have trans regional appeal the electoral college has more certainty outcome for election for example the election obama received percent the electoral votes very convincing number but only the popular vote not convincing the electoral college also avoids the problem tie the votes even though the electoral college has votes which would make possible for tie very unlikely that there tie the electoral college for example richard nixon only received the popular votes but won the electoral college bill clinton had only the popular vote but also won the pressure run off election reduced with the electoral college the electoral college gives the big states more representation than the smaller states for example florida has electoral votes while state like maine only has the popular vote was really close florida but obama won and got electoral votes the same thing happened maine the winner would only receive electoral votes america used the popular vote decide who won the win few votes would mean almost nothing and the big states would have the same representation the small states the president can win the election just winning one region states the electoral college has made that the candidate would have have trans regional appeal this desirable for most people because president that only popular one region and not everywhere will not good president this why candidates don campaign places that they know they will win and branch out the swing states these swing states basically decide the election they are the states that not favor either the democratic republican candidate they have important votes swing states one way will the election this why many candidates campaign these swing states you can see senator the electoral college the best way for electing new president has more certain and guaranteed outcome than the popular vote gives more representation the bigger states and requires appeal from people all over america not just people one region,506,0.0039525691699604,4

the electoral college full debates but the biggest debate they should still have power they should not stay power becuase the united states america democracy its easier and more democratic the candidate won popular demand what democracy good for the electoral college can change their choice who becomes president many the representatives the electoral college are unfair voters and sometimes cheat the voting system would you want that running your countries choices dont think the voters choose candiate the electoral college but they can always change their votes for example back segregationists the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john kennedy stated source two basically you want republican president win you would vote for republican representative the electoral college but thats not always the truth voters can not control the mind representative few seconds they become member the opposing sides and thus they have your vote this known unfair use your vote that can obviously not taken back was the the year many people realized the lies the electoral college bradford plumer author the indefensible electoral college states that gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency this means that the electoral college cheating the voting system and lying their voters your votes even matter not really over percent voters would perfumer direct election the kind have now said plumer this system have for voting basically useless and just gives the electoral college more power run the electoral college does have some good reasons its still power source three written richard posner states that the pressure the presidential election process reduced the electoral college which invariably produces clear winner other words when there run off election tie the electoral college brings down this pressure making the choice its quicker make choice who becomes president sadly very few people find the electoral college useful but they lot things that help make the elections easier the voters and putting less pressure the candidates the past few years people have realized what the electoral college actually does its true believe that they grab our vote and change last minute they also can help the process the presidential election but they make the voters confused and get called unfair adn cheaters which true this country was truely democracy then the people would have complete ownership who becomes president not the electoral college,553,0.0072332730560578,4

thoughts the story making mona lisa smile lets real first before get started the real thing who came with all these weird names for facial expressions and facial muscles goodness thought was surely going get taken out class from laughing hard these weird names think that using technology read someone emotions horrible stupid mean come why invade someones privacy why trust computer when can multifunction and calculate wrong yet some might say its good thing invade others personal emotions using technology see what their feeling and figure out why their feeling that way not everyone facial tissue muscles are the same nor can you predict what their facial expressions mean emotions using computer model someones facial strucker you can see the muscles the face different forms and can tell what emotions are showing example your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips show your anger the people who agree with using this technology would rely the facial model someone and look for muscle tightening high raises the eyebrows tightening the jaw people who not agree this would say you can not always believe what technology says maybe someones facial expressions are natural for insistence someone who was born with bifunctional issues lip attached their nose someone were use picture someone with lip disorder and the persons lips are tight they assume cause they are mad when reality they might just sad because their lip stuck like that and your assuming tight cause their mad paragraph talks about humans calculating everyday well for one when the author says you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face what makes you think she could she don assume genders author simply some people have trouble showing the right emotions too for instance you could happy and have frown your face and someone were send the the facial computer and ask what she his emotions right now well the computer would say they are confused when really they are happy and just had their face rested frown paragraph says that most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication computers need understand that too huang notes said why computers need understand how feel want someone know how feel will let them know what the point wasting time working computer figure out how someone feels when you could simply ask and not waste money and time computer that could malfunction the author say that the mona lisa demonstration intended bring smile your face while shows you just how much the computer can well surely didn bring smile face instead made think lot questions stuff like what happens your called computer malfunctions where will everything surely you have everything saved have you tested many people more than were those people all the same were they different you know what people will think how they will react all this new technology why did you use technology what happens when into blackout and you can rely any the technology people will want answers and then turn you cause you relayed something that can function without electricity paragraph explains some encoding emotions and what while looking the mirror then the author says that those instructions are for face that looks happy now your smart and shall hope you are both know you mirror and force your eyes squint and force your lips move upwards and then raise your cheeks lets just say that will not look like happy face will look like someone who doesn know how smile and trying force fake smile that looks horrible wrong paragraph talks about how muscle clue can tell when politician celebrity isn being truthful well what someone asks them personal question and they don want the whole world know and you and use that computer their face you made and tell the world they were lying that question well you just ruined that for them and exposed them now know what your thinking they wouldn that and maybe your right wrong their always someone who can hack get the full version this what you call facs and that person would probably spill the world and thank you for creating that machine then you sucked into the law suits and drama and people who would sew you for ruining the world someones life paragraph the author says according the facial feedback theory emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them does really mean you can force smile and all know faking smile does not make you happy these facts are from someone who probably just used couple peoples facial expressions get publish his her book why not ask more than couple peoples opinions and what they say about all this understand why you would want read students emotional expressions during class see how they feel and what you could make better but what doesn get better and you try everything you can and their still sitting cals bored and tired and not giving rat then your stuck with machine you don need anymore and less money than you had because you wanted spend machine then asking the student what they thought could help them most people would spend money machines try help kids because thats all their used doing spending money kids make them happy when reality you just need have them suck and pay attention reward them with things that don cost lot something that doesn cost anything this opinion and

have you ever wondered how could try prevent big problem with teens this country yes teens may have lot problems that need attention including drama drugs alcohol and bullying but the biggest them all which people sometimes try hide would probably have suicide with this new technology could help find the ealy signs teen about self harm and that just one thing that this technology could help wondering what this new technology facial action coding systems could help our schools many ways but here are just select few them making students more productive keeping students out trouble and ultimately helping prevent self harm first point that this new technology can help students more productive said paragraph lines through this program could recognize when student getting bored with the lesson just the way the muscles are strained the students face and change the lesson little bit make more appealing learn just like effective human instructor people may argue that this will just make our students get even more distracted and make trouble with out instructor which comes next point this program can also help keep our students out trouble this technology keeps changing the lesson the students don get bored distracted then that will keep them task instead carrying with their friends and causing ruckus class which will then lead higher test scores and just over all better education for the students which then people may also argue that with the automation and not much human confrontation could make our students feel alone and think about making bad decisions self harm even harm others last and most strong point would that this technology could help prevent self harm within the student body which huge problem with teenagers these days this technology can help detect early signs depression and many other mental illnesses which would amazing because then the students that would need help would get the help that they needed before they make bad decision self harm yes people may say that technology taking over the world and that horrible thing but with the students kids these days thats all that they really rely and not good thing but nor bad thing can keep changing technology and improving help more and more people all over than why don conclude this essay would have say yes this technology will more than likely very well our schools and more than likely after while something else better will come along and take its place but for now this would probably the best decision for this country and the students help them more productive keeping them out trouble and ultimately helping prevent self harm,575,0.0052173913043478,4
landform not civilization the matricule nasa has confirmed that the face mars was just landform also called martian mesa the image was found area mars that called cydonia the shaped like face looked like real human face but was just shaped that way others think that ancient alien civilization that used mars but now there nothing mars and seems like the alien civilization has left things behind when they disappeared when nasa first saw the face they didn know what belive they too pictures and why landform and that not alien civilization because michael malin and his mars orbiter camera crew snapped photo the face ten times web surfers were waiting for results and came out landform there for was never alien artifact reasons why people would think that the face could have been face from alien civilization because the face really looked like actually face and that could have been from actually civilization some people believe that are not the only ones the universe and some other people think that are the only ones the universe and when this these images was sent made people believe the time that when there was answer what the face ment people but when nasa confirmed that the image was just landform people most likely still believed that still alien civilization because some people they ask where did the artifact get there there any other artifacts that are mars another area after movies blogs and books lots are considering these things and some people might afraid what else might out there nasa might trying answer some these questions but for right now just landform nasa has found more space like things that couldn have been explained but maybe the future they could find more things mars than just landform try find more things other planets than mars there whole solar system for could find least one thing the universe that not just landforms,430,0.0162790697674418,3

certainly there are many different opinions about the face found mars some people believe the face was made aliens while other people believe natural landform strongly believe that the face natural landform because there scientific evidence prove that landform could formed mars and there are similar landforms like the face earth first all there scientific evidence that proves landforms can form mars for example scientists have found that mountains canals and volcanoes have formed mars scientists have also found that mars like earth has tectonic plates tectonic plates cause many different landforms form when they shift and move around tectonic plates create landforms earth that human can should reasonable think that tectonic plates can the cause landforms mars secondly mars has similar landforms the landforms earth just like earth mars has volcanoes mountains and canals scientist have found that tectonic plates are the cause many the landforms see earth today for example mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide and push against each other trying push the opposing plate underneath none the plates budge the plates will begin push each other tho form mountains for canals form water would have run over the land for while and erode the rocks until ditch forms even though there isn water mars now scientist have proved that water has once been mars since water and tectonic plates cause landforms earth the same elements must cause landforms mars well even though believe that the face natural landform many other people will disagree with that statement many people with opposing viewpoints from mine will say that aliens built the face firstly there scientific evidence even prove the existence aliens secondly the pictures from the space crafts show sign any civilization near the face earth may have ancient pyramids that weren formed naturally but there were civilizations around those pyramids around the face mars there sign any villages aliens living there with bird eye view the face does seem have any human facial features only when there shadow the features human being appear this makes the face seem like was just coincidence that had terrestrial features with the lack evidence support the claim that aliens made the face mars hard believe that such idea could true conclusion believe the face mars just natural landform because there are landforms earth that are the same those mars and those landforms were made from tectonic plates and water believe that you look the evidence provided you before you draw any conclusions,562,0.0017793594306049,5
hello name hannah scientist nasa who has been studying the face mars over the years today close friend mason had asked about any information found out recently said well just appears natural formation rather than something that was created argued and argued over how the aliens built and how its just been hidden all these years shorter explanation told mason that the shadows show how they earth natural formations didn quite get showed him messa and how they shadow still thought the marians made the formation the face the next day talked about the same thing only this time knew that could prove him that the face was only natural pulled the pictures taken over the years and let mason examine them very carefully the picture taken shows that there nothing else around the face there was anything the ground such airplane shack you have been able tell what was but there was nothing mason still didn agree that the form mars was natural landform was now the third day has argued over the face mars but this day mason didnt argue with asked see the pictures again along with pictures messa and butte which are natural landforms here earth mason looked for hours and hours and hours finally spoke maybe you guys here nasa are right seems completely natural replied told you old pal next time you should look into something more before you argue about the next morning mason came work with the other scientists and all came agreed that the face mars was completely natural not only did nasa finally figure out how unmask the face and call natural landform but they also provided lot information that way people understood better this day the face known natural landform,432,0.0092592592592592,3
the article driverless cars are coming the author displays positive and negative aspects driverless cars although driverless cars are very fascinating they pose several negative aspects including safety hazards liability issues and the car technological abilities safety the most important thing when comes developing driverless car right now driverless cars can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designated notify the driver when the road ahead required human skill such navigating through work zones and around accidents the driver must remain focused the road even driverless car according werner this poses psychological hazard because driver prone get bored while the car normally driving this can result accident due the driver failure respond the driverless car that needed human support while navigating through problem the road driverless cars still need driver the car still not safe enough out the public because risk both pedestrians passengers and drivers furthermore driverless cars can also lead issues traffic laws and liability since now traffic laws are made based the assumption that the car under the control human driverless cars became available would lead problems deciding what traffic laws will apply what people one very important issue posed the article was that the technology fails and someone injured who fault the driver the manufacturer some people may believe that the development driverless cars positive thing since our technology capable making driverless cars that are safe certain extend and have ability mimic human skills although this all sounds very exciting and futuristic driverless cars are still not driverless they still need human support and regardless the smart technology any technology has the ability malfunction which will then lead other issues sum driverless cars seem like amazing vehicles that can make transportation easier however you look deeper you can understand how difficult the development these vehicles this case the negative aspects driverless cars definately override the positive ones,434,0.0161290322580645,4

the case having driverless car must say definitely for the development these futuristic masses machinery with that being said here are some reason should look into development techonology the rise and don have doubt that soon the near future are going able have fully functioning driverless cars there are mant factors that tie into having completely driverless car but the advanced age are know that new techonology coming quickly with every passing day the fact here that believed that less than four years car companies and manufacturers will have autonomous cars ready for the road technology truly beautiful thing with the testing new technology driverless car there definitely way get them work properly the roads yet there seems some controversy let these pieces machinery roam where they please large masses people are afraid driverless cars they come with excuses why they shouldn developed such there could problem with the manufacturing but manufacturer wouldn send off faulty autonomous car for selling would they that just reckless unfathomable and would make the manufacturer look bad which the last thing they could possibly want manufacturers are skilled people the field they are and are doing what possible with the skills they know make good use driverless cars and show that they are safe the could possibly the road shouldn neglect their hard work and give them credit where credit due overall for the development driverless cars accomplishing feat big creating piece machinery that can steer itself hard requires complete understanding technology with how far made already with the semi driverless car not unimaginable have complete driverless car our future holds great things and among those autonomous vehicle,400,0.0075,3

opinion think that driverless cars would wonderful thing have they would make much easier commute and from work school they would also make taking long roadtrips much more enjoyable being that you would not always have keep starring the road ahead the long boring sort way that have now driverless cars would also great for public transportation being that they could exempt the need for driver that would allow companies make more profit which turn would allow for better keep the buses trams etc also allowing for newer and better modes transportation purchased all around would benefit the public transportation industry even did not have autonomous driverless cars the roads would still better had cars that sensed the road conditions and kept track the driver help with accident prevention would decrease the number deaths caused each year distracted driving and also maybe even help make the human population whole better drivers the fact that would realize all the things that wrong while driving and maybe try correct those things then there the other side the autonomous driverless cars yes they would good because they would decrease the number accidents that are caused distracted divers but this may also bad thing most humans you give them something that can make them have work less will rely sourly that one product all that can possibly help them but when that product has malfunction could disasterous lets use this example johnny and few his friends are driving twisty mountain road his autonomous car johnny relying his autonomous car its job driving paying attention the road ahead the driving system the car has small malfunction the turning system the road takes sharp right turn and the cars going too fast recognize that the turn ahead the car comes the turn goes fast around the turn and starts slip the car then overcorrect sending johnny and all his friends straight into the side the mountain now see this would have been problem had johnny been paying attention the road ahead but thought that his autonomous car had all under control the autonomous car would great innovation driving but when human nature takes over and rely too much the product things such this may happen,508,0.0098425196850393,4

think driverless cars are not yusufu right now and that they should not let people drive driverless car the streets because person still needs the car and must remain alert case needs take control the car driverless cars are not safe and will cause lot confusion case accident driverless cars are useless because person needs car and must remain alert case needs take control the car the text says this means the human driver must remain alert and ready take over when the situation requires this does not make huge difference between that and driving also people would very uncomfortable and insecure about what could happen once watched video about peron testing the autopilot mode tesla and most the time was insecure putting his hands the wheel case something happens they should not let people use driverless cars the streets becuase they are not safe driverless cars are safe unreal sitios and places without other cars the text says they can steer accelerate and brake themselves but all are designed notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such navigating through work zones and around accidents this makes the car not safe also the car knows the streets and the buildings but does not know about others cars people that can intercept the car and that would not give enough time for the car react driverless cars are useless and they should not let poeple use them the streets because there would lot confusion case accident the text says the technology fails and someone inured who fault the driver the manufacturer the laws are not ready for driverless cars and case accident would depend lot factors find out who was the responsable the accident sum driverless cars could very useful technology but they have improve lot more driven the streets,418,0.0119617224880382,3

there lot controversy regarding the electoral college system voting the united states some voting members would argue that the system although flawed has yet make monumental mistake and say that the minor issues were resolved the very least barely effective the overall outcome the campaign however with the flaws and holes the system have aleady experienced there bound many more mistakes and would shocking very few that some those mistakes are catastrophic should remove the system the electoral college because questionable problematic and does not represent well our democracy the electoral college uses group people from each state numbers varying from each represent voters election the voters mark down candidate ballot however they are actually voting for group strangers represent them many voters not even realize that this the case politics there are many powerful and influential people who will drastic measures ensure that their ideas somehow make power bribes and incentives could easily given electors attempts sway their vote speaking these electors can anyone who are not public office position emphasis the anyone voters can never really sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get select once the votes have been counted voters can not fully control who the electors actually vote for there have been instances where electors have attempted completely avert the votes cast and choose different candidate that they want office only seems logical that voters should have direct say the presidential election participating election popular vote this way there less opportunity for scandal and confusion the voting process group segregationists the louisiana legislature almost succeeded removing electors who supported john kennedy with those who opposed him this had happened all the states electoral votes would have been cast biased electors rather than the actual voters themselves the same year hawaii sent two state electors congress instead one sad that maintain system our government that continues let issues like this arise along with issues with the electors why that the size state automatically gives bigger advantage elections texas and california are the most two slaught after swing states every election candidates will everything they can win over those electoral votes but what about the little states many the smaller states not get visited candidates some never even see campaign ads this system are using creates target areas the united states that are more valuable elections than others this way fair the voters smaller states despite having the exact same rights voters bigger states the electoral college proving less and less glamorous with every passing election slip ups like this can create monumentally bad situation and unfortunately this system only bound create more many people remember the problem the presidential election the electoral college had very effectively exemplified its flaws and inefficient ways operating gore and george bush were running opposed and despite winning the overall popular vote the country gore lost the election bush bush had received the most electoral votes therefore winning him the presidency basically despite the fact that more citizens chose gore president bush won out our constitution written that citizens the united states have unwavering right vote and select who gets put into office this case sounds more like the number electoral votes has unwavering right select who gets put into office this goes against democratic republic way operating our country and many ways makes more difficult for citizens take advantage their rights for many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created the electoral college there are certain things about the electoral college that could possibly make worth keeping for instance there technically region the country that has enough electoral votes vote president into office one area the controls large numbers votes along with this the system helps avoid run off elections which complicate the election process and provide clear winner however having straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens most constitutional and much less problematic the process has been used for long time our country but time make change the electoral college has proven more trouble than worth our country needs decide what within best interest for representation our citizens the most efficient way operate one our most sacred constitutional rights and maintain our democracy members our wonderful country remove the electoral college system,966,0.0134575569358178,6

driverless cars seem something that soon become reality the near future but are they safe companies like google toyota and bmw list all these pros like flexible transportation systems less fuel usage more safety features and overall the car being better driver than the driver but all the money that this project would need really worth there would have new laws and regulations problems between the driver and manufacturer and issues regarding our safety pedestrian and driver let start with the pro flexible transportation systems first off this would put thousands taxi and bus drivers out job and with the economy being how that would not pretty also some these cars still rely the passenger back into driveway parking space the passenger can drive impaired some way how this more flexible for everyone thousands lose their jobs for some robot that can even their job the full extent car companies boast that there are more safety features these cars such vibrating seats when there danger heads display the windshield more advanced sensors and flashing alerts but why put all this money towards driverless car that not even fully driverless when can add them the cars that take tests drive and that some assume are safer when drive ourselves which brings next point money the united states are already trillions dollars debt really need put all our money towards driverless cars that don even need sure the disabled elderly could use this very well but not when the cars are not one hundred percent safe one hundred percent driverless there point wasting money something that aren completely certain are going work waste time money and will put thousands out job manufacturers argue that these cars will have better response situations than humans how can they say that when they don even know the technology reliable there will malfunctions that humans have control over don know about you but was going get car wouldn trust car that isn completely reliable with life safety comes first lastly laws and regulations have spent decades trying perfect traffic laws and other regulations keep our roads safe but with these new driverless cars what happens those the technology malfunctions the buyer fault the manufacturer this will cause many problems involving lawsuits and maybe even lives being lost would have revamp almost are entire system traffic laws and even then would have make another set laws that appeal these new driverless cars worth driverless cars while they may have quite few pros that make think futuristic sci movies are they worth what they cost and not just money jobs time maybe even lives appears that these cars are coming the future but are they really the future,656,0.0015243902439024,4

making claim something almost everyday our lives many are proven false true many are too absurd ever true many don have actual support and quite few are actually good claims majority these come from science claims are usually just explanations there but there are some that are more line with what think claim some those are for stuff like space time other galaxies even other planets our solar system this case looking claim about why people are trying learn about venus the evening star firstly how about the claim itself and how well does end the claim stating that venus worthy target for studying despite any the dangers the most suitable answer this curiosity astronomers are fascinated venus because may well once have been the most earth like planet our solar system that some pretty good evidence and later part the article the claim made states that will likely lead into many other endeavors that are equally intimidating good evidence reasonable claim all there secondly what else supports the claim well claim our past still full mystery and yet still pursue the past another planet taking that role isn too far off the charts the last paragraph states that will led more endeavors because our curiosity not just because met the challenge our travels earth and beyond should not limited dangers and doubts but should expanded meet the very edges imagination and innovation because want because how nature works set our goals then strive meet them even the goals weren set ourselves goal goal and striving meet them the best can finally what dangers are looked and what are some solutions the article puts the dangers venus pretty well venus inhospitable with very thick atmosphere over eight hundred degrees fahrenheit the surface and much more pressure than the deepest parts our oceans what have come with get past this far stay safe distance away and study the surface new opportunities open machines get made out different metals that melt harder using different boards for electronics even going back early technology and using stuff like gears mechanical parts don need electricity compared the stuff use today yeah that about wraps the stuff related that claim venus may inhospitable but that doesn stop our curiosity from asking questions and our determination from trying answer those questions the claim about venus being worthy pursuit turns out well and definitely really interesting question ask while may not think about other planets often definitely very interesting learn about places like this evening star,612,0.0016339869281045,4

dear senator the electoral college controversial can very simple choice either keep change the voting process popular vote process that which the people vote directly for the president their choosing believe that you should consider changing the electoral college popular vote voting process for reasons such the fact that only one half americans are voting because they not believe that their vote will count states such california and texas because the voters not believe that the candidate will carry their state anywhere defense the electoral college section another reason because the winner take all system the candidates will not campaign much states they think they will win over without going there and they focus the swing states instead senator one the reasons that believe you should consider changing the popular vote process because only one half the eligible american population voted the election defense the electoral college section for reasons believe that they not think that the candidate running will somewhere with their state and the fact that they not think their votes will actually count towards the president that they would like win also the fact that segregationists will try and corrupt the voting process the electoral college when john kennedy was running for president segregationists tried replace democratic electors with other electors try and against kennedy therefore giving the opponent the upper hand the indefensible electoral college section senator the contrary would understand why you would like keep the electoral college because being set compromise that the founding fathers created making voting equal letting qualified citizens congress have the last word into the decision what the electoral college section way see how you would think that the electoral college fair system because the people are still choosing somewhat who the electoral college elects and the fact that anachronism factor that plays into the electoral college greatly defense the electoral college section the electors elected should trusted truthful people and they are vote for the nominee honest fact who got the most electoral votes defense the electoral college section but sometimes even the electoral votes are calculated and are higher the popular vote could higher than the electoral vote even its rare occurance defense the electoral college section senator you see both sides this controversy you could also see that the winner take all method all all unfair the winner take all method the candidates that are the election will take more time the bigger states and try and have ads for their campaign posted there and not the littler states they believe they will win without campaigning there the candidates will focus even more the swing states because they believe they will have more luck those states than the other smaller states seventeen states didn see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didn see single campaign what wrong with the electoral college section this fact goes show that the candidates would rather focus more the larger states and swing states than the smaller states this makes those smaller states less encouraged vote because the candidates don even bother come them campaign senator the end strongly believe that you should think about changing the electoral college popular vote process because will give the voters incentive for them vote for them decide who wins and who will run their state country power the people has always been great thought keep running around your brain for before you discard thoughts mere second think about would you like the people your state unhappy with you and disappointed because they had choice what happening around them would you like the people excited for the new changes allowing them some freedom choosing what they want and not what others want,832,0.0024038461538461,4

driverless cars are coming should let them well with the technology have today why not they would beneficial for our race while some people may see them just another difficulty would have work out think all the accidents would prevent the future with technology can afraid our objective science and technology increase our life span and enjoy our lives more driverless cares would promote both with all the accidents that happen every day would driverless cars cause more problems comparison while the person the driver seat may not ready take the wheel the driverless cars that have been made already alert you giving reminder that you still need remain alert for example general motors car has alert system that makes the derive seat vibrate when the driver required while the google car simply announces when the driver should prepared take over these inventions help prevent one many obstacles the driverless cars will provide all witch can prevented another problem would the worry hackers with technology today because tesla cars are all ran one mega computer what stop from being hacked this could cause huge problems cyber terrorism would big concern but even that preventable apple phones have been out for awhile now and still havn been hackle not even our government with our advances technology can put stop most accidents will there still law suits agaisnt companies accident does occur well while technology advances our laws remain take into consideration that while there would still problems there would far fewer than before don make laws prohibiting driverless cars that only slows down what too come and makes harder fix mistakes that the vehicles will have all humans make mistakes even the ones behind computers would rather have multiple people who work daily with time their hands fixing problems that would come along than people who are driving daily and the right moment forced make split second decision without full thought will put trust these vehicles and hope others will too laws are truely there focus keeping drivers passengers and pedestrians safe then why deny something that would make traveling safer automakers are continuing their work the assumption that the problems will solved however their technology won able give the pleasure driving those who wish drive werner huber bmw project manager driver admits that some manufacturers hope still make fun providing entertainment systems while they can trunked instantly manual driving needed would still safer than having people today who text with cell phones while they drive google has already had self driving cars since their cars have driven more than half million miles without crash this alone not proof enough the benefit would how many miles can humans drive without crash compared this google cofounder sergey brin believes automatic cars would fundamentally change the world should let the cars come believe,628,0.0079617834394904,5
interplanetary exploration modern day project that scientists are making quick progress scientists are fed with staying earth and the natural human instinct for craving new knowledge drives them explore where man has gone before scientists have tried numerous times study earth sister planet venus but have failed and coming back with new knowledge about the planet with recent ideas and new innovations scientists have carefully and thoroughly thought about every possible danger and how counteract this might cause the possibility sending humans venus one the main reasons could explore venus that referred earth twin for many reasons venus roughly the same size and density earth with venus orbit relation earth venus often our closest planetary neighbor venus also boasts many similarities that earth has venus has numerous mountains valleys and craters just like earth also earth grew and supported many forms life with the existence water and oceans scientists have found evidence water being found venus surface which good sign both planets also contain clouds over their landscape but venus clouds are much different earth clouds containing sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide poisonous humans this challenge has driven scientists for years come with new use existing products able study venus the atmosphere venus has proven very hazardous metal melting tin and other metals within hours scientists have come with new metal called silicon carbide which has proven last upo three weeks venus conditons but this not all scientists have come with though using mechanical computers they are able many calculations that are very difficult for humans their own these computers were used world war using electronics but rather series gears and levers what they needed this has proven that scientists are capable overcoming even the most challenging tasks using this new and old technology they are trying come with machines instruments able study the ground from their new aircraft with the harsh conditions venus ground and atmosphere scientists are not able get machine land the surface the planet without breaking melting causing them think another approach study venus with the idea how jet passenger planes fly over storms avoid danger they took that concept venus and will try create aircraft that will hover fly thirty miles above the surface avoid the danger venus clouds flying altitude thirty miles will replicate many conditions found earth such the sea level atmospheric pressure earth radiations and wind speeds this will increase the safety these missions substantial amount these new concept will aid the exploration new planets scientists are humans that have natural crave for new knowledge have tried interplanetary exploration for numerous years but with little success but with modern day technology and ideas the past have come with ways overcome challenges often brought with space navigation have come with silicon carbide material capable overcoming the conditions brought venus atmosphere venus earth twin boasting many similarities between the two with science quickly progressing with end sight will inevitably another planet whether nature tries stop not will improvise adapt and overcome many challenges brought with space navigation,702,0.0056980056980056,4
the article here talks about new technology one that very advanced and complex facial recognizing program that can tell what emotions you are feeling just looking your face can recognize when someone feeling sad angry disgusted surprised happy fearful just looking the facial muscles this type technology has great potential medicine education and service industries the reason this technology has great potential that can further advance how help people and when help them imagine there was facial recognition computer every classroom the computer could recognize when student has trouble with topic when they need something else focus then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor stated huang says most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication there are lot students every classroom near impossible for teacher pick all the nonverbal cues that students give off that where the computer comes and can pick those cues making every student priority the school not say that this techonology would not expensive purchase for every school but when you look the value could possibly bring the education system the cost may well worth this new software and technology great idea and has lot potential prominent the upcoming years the technology here now need the funding capitalize the opportunity that have been given this could drastically change our schools and bring more educated workers into the workforce that why the new software has lots value and would good investment the near future,345,0.0,3
there has been lot debate circling wether not the infamous face mars actual alien made structure face just natural landform professional opinion its safe for assume just natural landform although resembled face the first picture doesn necessarily mean was created life forms look like face the only features you can make out the called face are deep holes for eyes pointed part for the nose and line for the mouth doesn have any distinct features was made martians they most likely wouldn want monument human face what supposed you what butte mesa natural landform that common earth another reason you know isn face the camera quality the first image the camera quality wasn advanced today technology the pictures both and were both much more clear than the original photograph although you can make out somewhat face doesn mean thats what was could have just been blurry picture conspiracy theorists say actually was aliens and they made the face but nasa would greatly benefit from finding actual life mars nasa found legitimate alien lifeforms could benefit the whole world they were non hostile they could teach how make and use their technology could learn lot from them like why the landforms their planet resemble faces nasa has been trying find alien life for years they found they wouldn deny them and say they don exist there are lot people that think has face and the pictures are from years apart anything could have happened the landform that long natural wear and tear could have washed across the surface and rendered natural landform all seriousness they could right but would take lot more than years ruin solid rock the face mars had good year run was mostly scaring people and giving conspiracy theorists ammunition shoot the government try get admit there other life out there but its time face reality not face really landform there was life mars you could see with the cameras have today but sadly such luck not face mars just have imaginations that run wild with wonder,518,0.0077220077220077,5
for many decades scientists have tried land spacecrafts venus but any them had succeded one the reason because venus extreme temperatures which there average degrees fahrenheit making really hard land because will even melt submarines who are used dive the deepest part our oceans another reason thick atmosphere carbon dioxide that will make things even more harder but that not all venus also have highly corrosive clouds sulfuric acid then why try visit venus such extreme conditions this because astronomers are amazed the similarities that once had with the earth long ago venus once was covered with oceans imagine that living hell once had water that could have supported forms life just like earth scientist also says that the earth have future were can get amazingly high temperatures which human can live more and they are considering moving another neighbor planets conclusion venus sounds not option but the fact that once had water make this option this the nasa have idea hover miles above the ground have sight venus doing this can have limited insight the ambient and scientist can not make experiments with venus rock gas anything else such distance nasa also making other rapproachment study venus they are trying some simplified electronics made silicon carbide which has been tested and can last around three weeks the conditions venus,302,0.009933774834437,3
twenty five years ago spacecraft valle viking from nasa took picture what looked like human face eighteen years later mars global surveyor took photo that was ten times larger than the last one this photograph showed that was nothing more than natural land form some people thought that looked this way because clouds finaly mars global surveyor took second shot with much better resolution this one also suggests that nothing more than landform some people still think this was made aliens despite all the evidence going against think that just landform because aliens wouldn know what humans looked like isn that unlikely and there are other things could first reason that aliens would not know what humans look like you think about animals earth don look like humans aliens wouldn look like that either mars also has really bad conditions for life like survive plus aliens woul probably look even more different than animals because they evolved whole other planet even more unlikely that they would just guess what look like another reason that isn that crazy coincidence human face only two dots with dot centered under neath them and line under and this doesn even have very distinctive nose its just two dots and line its like when you look the clouds and see what looks like animals other familiar things you know aliens didn put those there last reason that there are plenty other things this could could just some sort landform especially the last picture you can see lines resembling something that was made naturally kind like butte messa earth only this mars this most likely made naturally the chances that this was made aliens incredibly low the first picture however does closely resemble human face the problem that with each picture looks les and less like human face also the last picture was taken cloudless summer day dont think this was built aliens because aliens wouldn know what looked like isn that unlikely and there are other explanations,466,0.0107296137339055,4
the author talks about the dangers exploring venus also talks about much safer ways explore the planet paragraph says these differences speed mean that sometimes are closer mars and other times venus this means that being able determine where the spaceship headed would quite difficult considering the act that may take while get there and the chances venus moving are pretty high lastly the paragraph also states each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours the author says that venus the closest planet being the most earth like because its familiar features for example venus has valleys mountains and craters paragraph says not only are there clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere but there thick atmosphere about carbon dioxide blankets venus paragraph also states the planets surface temperatures average over degrees farenheit and the atmospheric pressure times greater than what experience our own planet last the passage states also notable venus has the hottest surface temperature any planet our solar system even though mercury closer our sun all this information important have mind nasa were suggest leave planet earth venus for planetary visit just know what expect and aware the precautions should take,301,0.0099667774086378,2
plan claim would have that computers who identify human emotions would valuable thing because many students come class felling down sad sometimes and instead them keeping them selves somebody would hopefully kind enough and ask there doing okay they need somebody talk instead just having thorugh them selves just like child going thru depression the end the day you want look for those children and help them but another think would why would need this class instead using money for this technology they should fix the schools and bring more learning experiences around the country instead wasting money see how somebody feeling youll make somebody happy just saying have wonderful day today like the person grading this test hope you have wonderful day and hope the end the day pass this because its big part high school and clearly not the smartest student but the end the day get what have done and dont complain but this inversion would good project around the airport banks just see peoples reaction when they walk and there going out see the difference there face reactions the mona lisa demonstration really intended bring smile while shows how much this computer can imagine computer that knows when youre happy sad thall really crappy once knows how you feeling like example you smile when web appears your screen similar might follow but you frown the next will different this sounds good when you want certain kind apps pop but once the system knows how youre feeling another thing instead seeing how feeling they should help out people need who need the help help them keep there emotions better also crazy how theis technology would make easy for computer recognize when student becoming confused bored claim would have that would wan this class around school beacuse personalty feel like many students will come into school with different mood they knew there expressions feelings are all being detected instead them coming sad they probably chenar bit since they maybe dont want anybody know how there feeling and ill try hid and change there mood from what was first this process all begins with computer that constructs computer model the face all major muscles the model unit must move like human muscles some coding system facial expressions that its going able read six basic emotions like happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness many people are not gon na like the idea this beause people don want let everbody know what they are feeling what there thinking,570,0.0298245614035087,2
venus simple see from distant but very hard see close astronomers are very fascinated this planet before venus had average temperature over degrees fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that times greater than ours here earth astronomers think was alot like earth with big oceans and they think could have supported forms life like have here nasa working other approaches study venus some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested chamber simulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted for weeks these conditions venus this challenge that scientist and astronomers should defiantly look into striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors venus,179,0.0391061452513966,1

having facial action coding systems for classrooms may seem fun have but really isn valuable one reason behind this that students don school have fun they learn they don need their boredom recognized another reason will cost lot money when can used buy other utensils there are some benefits from having face scanners but doesn outweigh the downsides for example students will get bored class frequently that does not mean that the lesson has change just make fun depends how the teacher sets her classroom every teacher different some are boring and others are entertaining school isn meant fun but more educational another example why facial action coding systems aren valuable because they are bound cost lot money the money that will used installing that type technology can used buy other supplies that are needed some those supplies include paper books sports equipment etc that money can also used better the school there are any problems going students will better off having more utensils use that having their emotions read the other hand isn hard see why school would want that type technology they would all like more advanced stated the passage could modify the lesson modifying the lesson can help make more entertaining more entertaining students will more interested and will focus more the subject conclusion there are more reasons why facial action coding systems are not valuable than how they are for one students need look forward coming school learn more than have fun also the cost for that type technology could used for other resources instead wasting money luxury could spent needs that will help the students with learning people might think fun and exciting have computer tell how you feeling about subject school but that won help much conclusion reasons why facial action coding systems aren necessary outweigh the reasons why they would,452,0.0044247787610619,4

there are many dangers that come along with studying planets along with the dangers there are also countless benefits learning more about different planets the passage the challenge exploring venus the author addresses the point that venus worth taking closer look and focusing matter the dangers could put one although many people believe that the author doesn support this idea well the author provides researched evidence and past experiences all throughout the passage support this idea the challenge exploring venus the author includes well researched evidence support the idea that venus worthy studying further when explaining nasa ideas sending humans venus the author states nasals possible solution the hostile conditions the surface venus would allow scientists float above the fray this provides evidence that shows what solution avoiding some the difficulties that occur when trying explore venus the author was able support his idea throught the use nasa and research the passage continues come with plan the best way float above venus when the author says thirty plus miles above the surface temperatures would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth this factual evidence that included ensures that the author supporting this idea the fullest his potential researched and factual evidence that provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well the also supports his idea studying venus depsite the dangers because includes past experiences that make this idea stronger when explaining past explorations venus the author states long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like earth facts that have been presented that occured the past help the author support his idea that there reasons why people should look into further studying venus these past facts present the idea that venus once looked like earth did and that true there are reasons why should looked into further the passage later explains examples nasa approached studying venus when the author says another project looking back old technology called mechanical computers these devices were first envisioned the and played important role the during world war the idea looking back past resources help the studying venus would help the process this past project key tool that helps support that venus should studied even though can extremely dangerous using past experiences such the ones included helps support and grow the authors idea ultimately understandable why one would believe that isn smart look into studying and experimenting with venus however the examples the researched facts and past experiences help support the authors idea that despite the dangers venus worthy studying there may many dangers that come along with studying different planets but based off the evidence the author provided venus has avoidable ways make safe study,619,0.0032310177705977,5
the facial action coding system system that will construct computer model the face and use muscle movements figure out what you are communicating emotionally with that being said will this information given the system valuable classroom here are reasons why believe would valuable both the students and teacher the classroom classroom you have wide range personalities students may feel shy uncomfortable asking questions teacher asks how well the class dealing with the subject student may say they are dealing well with the subject when they really are not huang says most human communication nonverbal including emotional communication computers need understand that too teacher classroom can understand verbal communication but maybe only slight emotional communication having facial action coding system facs your computer can help understand the majority what student may really feeling about the subject lot times today classrooms are packed with students also giving wide range abilities this range ability doesn allow teachers time help the struggling students paragraph six huang says classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor had this technology could help students keep with the rest their class changing how the lesson taught depending the individual this technology would have the capability figure out more easily the emotions student and able relay that back the teacher teacher may think that class enjoying the subject based what they say what they act like when actual fact this may not the case according the text expert faces don lie these muscle clues are sometimes used spot when smiling politician celebrity isn being truthful this technology can understand students are not relating well with the style teaching that available and then make this information available the teacher the teacher can then look what the students really feel like their class and then adapt the style structure class facilitate more engagement and interaction from the students therefore believe that the use this new technology would valuable facs would able help struggling students better than they are their subjects changing the lesson depending their emotions would able modify the lesson for student that they may more easily understand would able help teachers understand how their students feel the classroom and they can more easily facilitate the students different learning styles this system would help the whole classroom function more effectively,553,0.0,4

development cars will improve our society and make everyday life much easier people will much happier and more free with cars that drive them everywhere without worrying about traffic the advantage having car that will talk you anything goes wrong beyond amazing this break through will lower many accidents and safety always has first the development cars should continued further because will help people with disabilities through life easier the frustrations always being alert while driving could made easier and the technology developing more could lead other break throughs supporting idea how people with disabilities alway have harder than others when driving cars doesn matter your old even deaf anybody with disability will tell you harder drive under circumstances like these the deaf world the deaf people believe that they can anything hearing person can and that true but driving accidents happen all the time not being able hear just makes worse someone did not hear car behind them honking because there something coming towards the car the traffic light green and hasn noticed many things can wrong that moment having car that will alert you with flashing lights will much safer choice than leaving how alert person everyone human and everyone makes mistakes but the development cars mistakes will avoided the mistakes that will avoided can even save lives senior citizens will probably say that having technology based car that would make easier for them get and out their car what they have alway wanted when person old and fragile they want treated with grace cars that are more developed will hopefully give their hips rest from the other cars that are hard drive and sit another aspect that will away with furthur developed cars the frustrations driver always having alert people will make mistakes driving and with car that will watching driver and ready correct that mistake will make much more safer for the driver and others that could potentially hurt from someone mistake accidents can happen second and these futuristic cars can prevent all the deaths each year then why not furthur develop cars the developments will have drivers that are ease not always having alert and jumpy the wheel makes everyone happy the way google uses their cars have alerts will perfect for any driver the story talked about how flashing lights will put into the cars and sounds alert the driver any mishaps the technology reaches even more developments will great for example the drivers will not even have drive the third supporting idea will how the development cars could lead more break throughs anyway the cure for cancer could just need tweak and the develoment cars could push that noodge yes cars are totally different than diseases but one tuley thinks about human beings could begin furthur develop their brains more any aspect technology leading forward will have scientists and manufacturers working together furthur developing cures and even inventions that will help any person with disability the help that will pushed from all this technology just makes the idea developing these cars more the technology that will developed will inspire many things the break throughs will come from more ideas once developed many people will pose the idea developing the technology cars people believe that people will become lazy but the truth people are already lazy many people die from car accidents and most the time because someone was lazy focus the road instead the radio forgot that they were drinking break throughs with cars will allow people save lives and put safety fist the development car should not stopped but continued because furthur developed cars will help people with disabilities will allow alerts made for the driver always the watch will also lead other break throughs down the line supporting the idea developing cars should voted for and people need realize that change good,832,0.0084134615384615,5

even though the electoral college known disaster factor has its benefits the electoral college process that consists the selection the electors each candidate running your state has his her own group electors that are voted for when you vote election day which held every four years tuesday after the first monday novemeber you vote for the candidate electors many politicians wanted abolish the electoral college because its lack democratic pedigree but the college doesn allow voters other regions feel disenfranchised avoids run off elections and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should the ones decide the election the electoral college requires presidential candidate have trans regional appeal would not fair for candidate campaign heavily state that they know they are going win this does not gain them any electoral votes increasing his plurality states that knows will win this causes voters that are from the opposite region feel their votes did not count that their new president would not care about their interests values the president would not really their president because the fact that they were ignored voters that are more likely pay attention the campaign listening each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election voters that voted didn care and picked the weaker candidate then everyone would pay the price the knowledgable voters listen the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates this leads candidate worthy enough become president which will choose the country decisions for the next four years run off elections where elections which candidate receives majority the votes cast avoided there pressure for run off elections when candidate wins majority the votes cast which complicates the presidential election process but reduced the electoral college announce clear winner the run off election once happened nixon and clinton many argue the fact that the electoral college method may turn off potential voters for candidate who has hope for carrying their state people knowing their vote will have effect will have less intentions paying attention the election then they would have the president picked the popular vote voter presidential elections are people who want express political reference and want the best for their country future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point voting,496,0.0,4

yes aginst these driverless cars because anything can happen any certain time like what the car doesnt alert you car coming close you you are about get into crash you could end losing your life and they wouldnt know the car failed not was just you who did something wrong and the manufacturer would seriously have deal with some big problems the car was part the reason why that person died other reasons why against driverless cars that they dont seem that safe just because you tested just that one car doesnt mean any other car you make cant malfunction either there only five known places that are illegal where you can actually test driverless car that means every other state country doesnt mean its safe because its illegal wont believe till see its safe because many things could wrong like what the car doesnt alert you time when your trying back and you hit car that would cause serious problems also what there crash about happen and the car coming straight towards you and the car alerts you late what will happen then you could end dead because the car didnt alert you time these cars could aslo very expensive not everybody could afford one because people are struggling alot the only people who could really probably afford these are millionaires and other rich people the world even big brand name car comines like bmw mercedes benz audi nissan and even google even though they are not car company they just want the first ones make driverless car those big name brand car companies say that there will driverless cars which about four years away from now but any thing can happen within fours years nothing will change mind about these cars unless have proof that they can make these cars safe and affordable for people even though the just one car millions but there main priority should about the safety for people and they should atleast make back system for the car incae something bad happens the car loses control they should atleast make way make the car automatically shut off stop they should really stop worrying about the design the car and start worrying about peoples safety,458,0.0174672489082969,3

the article driverless cars are coming the author presents both positive and negative aspects driverless cars these cars have been thought and have been driven more than half million miles without crash the negative way that most people will still have alert and this will cost more money and depending the crash both reichle and drive will not able figure out who has done most people are having hard time focusing the road just because texting being the phone with others there were positive ways the driverless cars but there are limits these cars can face there are some positive ways the driverless cars google cars has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions these cars read the positive and negative polarity message the binary code there were also sensors the wheels the creation antilock brakes they have become more advanced the pass ten years further improvements sensors and computer hardware and software make driving safer driverless cars will give the driver more time text and finish phone calls with others also help keep drivers passengers and pedestrians safe while driving control the negative way observing driverless cars were the price how much all this will cost how most people would react and wither not whose fault would crash has happened even though these smart road systems the beginning worked the requited massive upgrades existing roads and that way expensive practical these sensors that car needed you would not just buy radio shack but some where highly expensive manufacturers people would need alert the whole time some signals would sent out you needed address the wheel such vibrating seat announces when the driver need take over flashing lights the windshield manufacturers are trying set cameras watch the driver paying attention but means are being watched and our privacy will invaded some countries are allowing limited use the driverless car because traffic laws are written with the objective that only safe car has human driver control technology fails and someone injured whose fault the driver the manufacturer something could have broken and maybe signal was not given the driver causing them crash could aslo the driver was heavily intoxicated and could not take control the car conclusion there are positive and negative ways the driverless cars are coming the positive side seeing this that there will less accidents cars will also able drive independently letting have more time text the phone sensors will way improved near future with the brakes and sending alerts the negative way the driverless cars are that america will pushed more into debt because the expensive parts that are needed there crash one will know who has done and how fast will people react the signals the car,610,0.0131147540983606,4

the author claim that exploring venus worth pursuing even tho its every dangerous the author suggests that studying venus great chance learn and find new things and supports alot theses claims giving some great support why its good idea the author starts explaining that venus referred earth twin maney cases cause its the closest planet the earth terms density and size venus also nicknamed the evening star one the planets closest the earth distance also mars that distance aswell all three planets are around and orbit the sun different speeds says the author paragraph often referred earth twin venus the closest planet earth terms density and size and occasionally the closet the distance too earth venus mars our planetary neighbor orbit the sun different speeds the author starts giving his part why should study and travel venus saying its the planet the may have once been the most earth like planet the solar system long ago and was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms life just like how earth today venus still has some known features that still resemble earth today like the planet havering rocky sediment and includes things such valleys mountains craters alho venus does seem nice its very dangerous travel there and not safe for humans the moment scientist have sent numerous spacecrafts land venus but spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours venus also has thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide that arounds venus the even more challenging thing the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid venus atmosphere and the fact that the planets surface temperature over degrees fahrenheit making these far more extreme than anything humans encounter earth said the author paragraph thick atmosphere almost percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds highly corrosive sulfuric acid venu atmosphere traveling venus seems too dangerous but the author gives some ideas how can passably make traveling venus safer one these ideas come from the national aeronautics and space administration also known nasa this idea for sending humans study venus nasa soliton the harsh venus conditions its surface make blimp like vehicle that would hover miles above the planet this would allow scientists avoid the unfriendly ground conditions venus and with the only minor problem being the air would still little hot degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure being close earth sea level this one the maney ideas how vist the planet venus and its values says the author striving meet the challenge presented venus has value not only because the insight gained the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead into many equally intimidating endeavors,594,0.0488215488215488,4

think that the technolgy really can tell ore actual emotions believe this because some people can just pretend smiling and look happy but you really dont know what they are actually feeling they couk sad angry depressed can never know what they truly feel just the look someone some people just pretend okay because they dont want people asking worrying but also sometimes you can tell that there actually wrong with them because the maybe try act like they are okay but they really cant hold for long technology can maybe believe that they know someones emotions their faces expressions but the inside what actually matters you really know how someone feels but also sometimes can very confusing because they are showing lot different emotions and they are maybe confused themself but thats okay lot people feel that way technology very smart and uts becoming bigger time goes but know and believe that technology cant really know how someone actually feeling they can tell the face but not the true feeling does your expression the mirror suggest emotion maybe you looking yourself the mirror and you feeling sad maybe you can see your face because its actually you feeling sad but someone really doesnt know just the face just you cause its you and its the same for technology they really cant tell what your emotion just looking you unless you really happy and sometimes you can actually show emotion inside and out and your computer can tell actual emotion thats true well maybe because you really are feeling happy sad etc believe that technogym really cont tell someones emotions,342,0.0087719298245614,2

why the facial action coding system irrelevant sometimes people have bad days and can have huge impact others but only people choose show human emotion can displayed many ways some ways emotion can expressed are through body language and facial movements changes however one chooses show their emotion all their decision and does not need known everyone else the facial action coding sytem not valuable because person own choice decide whether not they want someone else know how they are feeling emotions are not relevant students classroom and there are not many ways that knowing emotions can benefit people their careers person emotions not involve other people although emotions can caused others emotions not have known others the article making mona lisa smile nick alto the author states for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her face person can already make guess how someone may feeling their own why would they need the facial action coding system this would actual waste technology because would doing natural job that human can their own students classroom are there for learning about subjects such math science language arts and social studies neither which involves emotions bringing the facial action coding system into classroom would more distracting than helpful students and teachers should focused more the lesson than how one feeling during the article says that classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts this case students could also become very playful with the technology and trick access unreliable feedback knowing emotions may benefit psychologists when wanting understand the true feelings one their patients career based setting however classroom setting reading student emotional expressions not needed some students may not enjoy school but they are still required the article notes that huang adds then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor this means that not only would the facial action coding system able read the emotions students but would also takeover the job being teacher this disadvantage for teachers since they are there answer any questions and the lesson planning this would also put many teachers out job there are very few benefits there relevance for knowing the emotions students and any emotions person may not want detected therefore the facial action coding system not valuable technology supposed beneficial humans and make life easier the facial action coding system does the opposite that emotions should revealed through person own wish not through computer this could make many people very angry due the programming this technology the goal behind the facial action coding system may read emotional expressions but the emotions created people from being able could become very upsetting,635,0.0031496062992125,5
intro today ill telling you the pros and cons about having this technology our schools from counselors being able tell whats with the student invading the privacy what humans have preventing suicide and able maybe stop someone from commiting suicide knowing someone going through depression body personally think this would some great technology have our schools epically for consoles say someone really sad and depressed but they are scared open about how they feel whats going you put the computer there face and shows they are depressed sad and scared well now you know how your student feeling then you cheer them and work make things better you dont know but you just saved life because who knows weather not that student was about comit suicide say someone was threatened and they will not tell you that they act like there fine but you put the computer them and shows that they are scared now you know they are scared and can try work with them open but from other people perspectives can totally see how this total invading privacy because all have secrets and dont want people knowing were depressed sad and alot people dont like communicate open with anyone and also what things get passed around about you being depressed the generating today are bulls can see someone making fun someone for being depressed conclusion conclusion think would some great technology have our schools just think about how many lives can change how many lives can save just knowing how the person next you feeling would save lot time trying get the person tell you whats wrong when you can just take picture there face yes think would great because ill make life better you would save more time and you could change alot lives and save alot lives with this type technology,396,0.0252525252525252,3

believe the use the technology read students emotional expression pretty rusticated but dont think necesssary the article humans can assume other people emotions because have the same emotions everyone else humans know what looks like happy suprised anger disgusted scared and sad because all threw know that there obviously more that only emotions some people feel jealousy and some may feel uncomfortable others may feel paine and some will feel stress that already more emotions that can calculate and computer can another thing that humans can calculate sound can here person crying can detect that they might sad someone yelling can detect that they are mad got hurt they might even excited depending the tone the voice those are couple reasons why think dont relly need the technology reading emotional expressions maybe that just little extra dont think need calculate the way people feel threw computer wouldnt want everyone knowing how feel all moments like privacy want talk about how feel someone that trust then would but know that definitely would not like anyone and everyone being able know emotion whenever thed like just knowing that this could possible gives chills this should not used everyone especially they dont feel comfortable about understand that the machines can modify lessons like effective human instructor can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games even video sergey which pretty amazing agree that the emotion analyzing shoulds used for things like that helps out the way technolgy looks and aslo attracts more people the facial expression for each emotion are universal that something they have said while detecting the mona lisa technology like computer can obviously change the world with people creating and discovering new indias shar with everyone including the world say dont ditch the technology all together but maybe just the parts that can handle our own like detecting emotions other people instead can focus communicating can develope these skills distinguish emotions instead not gaining any knowledge and letting technology all the work for although this idea was fantastic and incredible dont think important for out needs,497,0.0422535211267605,4

technology has grown the past couple years has grown much tha now computers can read human emotions emotions and computers normally are seperate from each other every human has different emotion and ways show these emotions now computers could read our emotions with new technology called facs facial action coding system facs could possibly affect how teachers could run class teachers never truely know student paying attention the lesson not facs could show the emotion the students and teacher daily classroom classroom computer could recognize when student becoming confused bored huang predicts then could modify the lesson like effective human instructor paragraph computers could read the emotions students then give report back the teacher order for the teacher see the students emotions the teachers could even use facs lesson lab the article makin mona lisa smile the seventh paragraph gives steps how read emotions person teachers could use the steps explain how facs works before lab being able use facs lessons labs could interest the student the lesson main class that could use the health class for the emotion section the book class friends can read their own friends emotions very well because the friends know each other well for instance you can probably tell how friend feeling simply the look her his face paragraph instead teachers not being able tell the emotion just looking students face then maybe facs could help allow the teacher make lessons emotionally fun teachers could use this type techology classes for lessons then maybe facs could valuable thing the teachers could use the students emotions make lesson good bad with technology rise right now the students may enjoy using facs due the fact that technology most human communication nonverbal including emotional communion notes huang computers need understand that too paragraph facs could also make the students want pay attention class more each student would have different emotion the new technology different emotions are common and there are different ways show those emotions this new technolgy facs could help the different emotions caught class you not want any sleeping students classroom,492,0.0142276422764227,3
the challenge exploring venus the author suggest that studying venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers despite through the story shows worthy pursuit but dangerous because venus most like ours many ways the structure set just about the same way and going past the dangers they have the great technology help stepthrough the pursuit this mission worthy because the planet mostly like ours the two planets venus and earth are called sister planets paragraph these planets are most alike because venus once had rocky surfaces mountains valleys oceans and more for example paragraph says long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could haved supported various forms life this proves that even though there will some slight dangers still worthy pursuit knowing our sister planet and structurally the same ours was once before knowing the similarities with venus and earth can take step back with some the dangers yet make very fascinating take visit see venus venus and alot actions the world will always have there dangers venus and studying venus can cautious the sam estime because the temperatures are slightly higher than what earth gets states paragraph temps would still toasty around degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would close that sea level earth yes there are dangers with temperature and weather venus but there are more advantages than the negatives last advantage that nasa could use study and collect data from venus the technology have these days they have mechanical computers gears and levers help them and shocking devices says the thought computers existing those days may sound shocking but these devices make calculations using gears and levers and not require electronics all there are mcnay advantages this study looking the objects they have and the resources they have study and get information venus makes all out more interesting them study venus and make visit like the people have talked about through the story although there are many disadvantages and some negatives you look the positives and look the similarities worthy pursuit because most like earth many ways they have better techology uses these days but yet some dangers,476,0.0252100840336134,3

dear senator the electoral college has served for more than century determining our nation new president the electoral college process consists the selection the electors the meeting the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting the electoral votes congress states the article what the electoral college written the office the federal register this means that not vote directly vote for our new president but instead vote for electors that vote for candidate running for office though many individuals are favor keeping the electoral college kept will continue cause problems our nation our presidential campaign will much better change election popular vote for the president the united states begin with the electoral college the cause for many issues our nation presidential campaign first all voters sometimes can not even control whom their electors vote for ergo one may vote for elector our favorite candidate party however don know that elector will back his word and vote for another candidate the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong written bradford plumer states the single best argument against the electoral college what might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco was the biggest election crisis century the sytem allows for much worse consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will the people this means that the people never know their electors are going back their word and vote for another candidate aside from that their the worrying aspect tie occurring that were happen then the election would thrown the house representatives the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong written bradford plumer states shift just votes would have deadlocked the election tie would have occurred mere votes ohio and votes hawaii had voted the other way this says that those people had just voted for the opposite person then there would have been tie between the two candidates yes those numbers seem large but comparison the number voters that there were those years they small fraction them this shows how close elections are with the electoral college aside from causing issues the united states the electoral college extremely unfair voters the article what the electoral college written the office the federal register states most states have winner take all system that awards all electors the winning presidential candidate that not fair other voters who don vote for the popular candidate their state they don receive any electors additionally most candidates only advertise and visit swing states swing states are the states that usually determine the outcome the election the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses the system are wrong written bradford plumer says during the campaign seventeen states didn see the candidates all including rhode island and south carolina and voters the largest media markets didn get see single campaign unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors your state you don get watch your candidates campaign previously mentioned each state has different number electoral votes all depends the population for example texas with huge population has electors while maine only has the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid out defenses the system are wrong states beacuse each state casts only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing voters would have much say the representatives from california who represent million voters why some states have more representatives than others just because their population not fair the smaller states true that the bigger states have more people them needing more representation however the smaller states have much say the big ones conclude the electoral college has caused many disastrous factors our presidential campaigns has caused the wrong president elected and doesn give our citizens much voice the election however changing the system popular vote for the president will give people louder voice this nation and will show them that the government cares about their opinion the article the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid out defenses are wrong written bradford plumer states offical the electoral college unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments favor are mostly assertions without much basis reality and the arguments against direct elections are spurious best hard say this but bob dole was right abolish the electoral college,1039,0.0057747834456207,5
