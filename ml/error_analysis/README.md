# Error Analysis for Machine Learning Models

This directory contains notebooks and tools designed for the error analysis of our machine learning models used in the automatic essay grading system. These resources aim to help identify weaknesses in the models and suggest potential areas for improvement.

## Overview

Error analysis is crucial to refining machine learning models. This section provides detailed evaluations of model performances, particularly focusing on:
- Misclassifications
- Error patterns
- Performance metrics comparison

## Contents

- `benchmark.ipynb`: A notebook that benchmarks various models used in the project, presenting a comparative analysis of their performance.
- `transformers_ea.ipynb`: Focuses on analyzing the errors specific to transformer-based models, providing insights into their classification behavior and limitations.
