# Data Preprocessing for Automatic Essay Grading

Welcome to the Preprocessing section of our Automatic Essay Grading project. This directory includes scripts and notebooks for preparing the data before it is fed into the machine learning models. This stage is crucial for ensuring data quality and relevance, which directly influences model accuracy.

## Overview

The preprocessing tasks are designed to clean and organize the data, as well as perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and ensure that the data distributions are well understood and appropriately prepared for modeling.

## Contents

- `eda/`: Contains notebooks for exploratory data analysis to visualize and understand data characteristics and distributions.
- `sampling/`: Includes methods for handling imbalanced datasets to improve model training effectiveness.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is crucial for:
- Understanding the dataset's structure and inherent patterns.
- Detecting anomalies and outliers that could impact model performance.
- Identifying relationships among features that can be used to enhance feature engineering.

## Data Sampling

Handling imbalanced data is essential to avoid model bias towards the more frequent classes. This section includes:
- Techniques for oversampling the minority class.
- Methods for undersampling the majority class.
- Combining approaches to create a balanced dataset conducive to more generalizable model performance.
