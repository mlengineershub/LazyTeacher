# Model Training for Automatic Essay Grading

Welcome to the Training section of our Automatic Essay Grading project. This directory is dedicated to the training of various machine learning models that predict essay grades based on textual analysis.

## Overview

The training processes are critical for developing effective models that can accurately grade essays. This section covers different modeling techniques and their implementations, providing a comprehensive approach to model training.

## Contents

- `tfidf/`: Utilizes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) for feature extraction followed by traditional machine learning models.
- `glove/`: Implements models using GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings to capture semantic meanings.
- `transformers/`: Advances to using transformer models, exploring various architectures and fine-tuning techniques.

## Training Models

Each folder contains specific scripts and notebooks designed for training models using different methodologies:

### TF-IDF
- Focus on linear models and tree-based methods that work well with sparse matrix representations from TF-IDF.

### GloVe
- Explore neural network architectures that can leverage pre-trained word embeddings to understand context and semantics better.

### Transformers
- Implement state-of-the-art transformer models that have shown great success in understanding and generating human language.
